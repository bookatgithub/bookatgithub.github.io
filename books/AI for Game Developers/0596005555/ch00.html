<P class="docText">
Recent advances in 3D visualization and physics-based simulation technology, at both the software and hardware levels, have enabled game developers to create compelling, visually immersive gaming environments. The next step in creating even more immersive games is improved artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in computing power, and in hardware-accelerated graphics in particular, are helping to free up more CPU cycles that can be devoted to more sophisticated AI engines for games. Further, the large number of resources—academic papers, books, game industry articles, and web sites—devoted to AI are helping to put advanced AI techniques within the grasp of every game developer, not just those professionals who devote their careers to AI.</P>
<P class="docText">With that said, wading through volumes of technical papers, text books, and web sites can be a daunting task for upcoming game AI developers. This book pulls together the information novices need so that they can get a jump-start in the field of game AI development. We present relevant theory on a wide range of topics, which we support with code samples throughout the book.</P>
<P class="docText">Many general game development books cover AI to some extent, however their treatment of the technology tends to be limited. This is probably because such books have to cover a lot of different topics and cannot go into great depth on any particular one. Although several very good books do focus on game AI (we list many of them in the "Additional Resources" section of this Preface), most of them are geared toward experienced AI developers and they focus on relatively specific and advanced topics. Therefore, novices likely would require companion resources that cover some of the more fundamental aspects of game AI in more detail. Still other books cover some specific game AI techniques in great detail, but are restricted to covering just those techniques.</P>
<P class="docText">Our book covers a wide range of game AI topics at a level appropriate for novice developers. So, if you are new to game programming or if you are an experienced game programmer who needs to get up to speed quickly on AI techniques such as finite state machines, fuzzy logic, and neural networks, among others, this book is for you.</P>
