<P class="docText">In the broadest sense, most games incorporate some form of artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, developers have used AI for years to give seemingly intelligent life to countless game characters, from the ghosts in the classic arcade game <span class="docEmphasis">Pac Man</span> to the bots in the first-person shooter <span class="docEmphasis">Unreal</span>, and many others in between. The huge variety of game genres and game characters necessitates a rather broad interpretation as to what is considered game AI. Indeed, this is true of AI in more traditional scientific applications as well.</P>
<P class="docText">Some developers consider tasks such as pathfinding as part of game AI. Steven Woodcock reported in his "2003 Game Developer's Conference AI Roundtable Moderator's Report' that some developers even consider collision detection to be part of game AI<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01_fnt001">[*]</A></sup>. Clearly, some wide-ranging interpretations of game AI exist.</P>
<P class="docText">We're going to stick with a broad interpretation of game AI, which includes everything from simple chasing and evading, to pattern movement, to neural networks and genetic algorithms. Game AI probably best fits within the scope of <span class="docEmphasis">weak</span> AI (see the sidebar "Defining AI"). However, in a sense you can think of game AI in even broader terms.</P>
<P class="docText">In games, we aren't always interested in giving nonplayer characters human-level intellect. Perhaps we are writing code to control nonhuman creatures such as dragons, robots, or even rodents. Further, who says we always have to make nonplayer characters smart? Making some nonplayer characters dumb adds to the variety and richness of game content. Although it is true that game AI is often called upon to solve fairly complex problems, we can employ AI in attempts to give nonplayer characters the appearance of having different personalities, or of portraying emotions or various dispositions—for example, scared, agitated, and so on.</P>

<P class="docText">The question "what is artificial intelligence?" is not easy to answer. If you look up <span class="docEmphasis">artificial intelligence</span> in a dictionary, you'll probably find a definition that reads something like this: "The ability of a computer or other machine to perform those activities that are normally thought to require intelligence." This definition comes from <span class="docEmphasis">The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition</span> (Houghton Mifflin Company). Still other sources define artificial intelligence as the process or science of creating intelligent machines.</P>
<P class="docText">From another perspective it's appropriate to think of AI as the intelligent behavior exhibited by the machine that has been created, or perhaps the artificial brains behind that intelligent behavior. But even this interpretation is not complete. To some folks, the study of AI is not necessarily for the purpose of creating intelligent machines, but for the purpose of gaining better insight into the nature of human intelligence. Still others study AI methods to create machines that exhibit some limited form of intelligence.</P>
<P class="docText">This begs the question: "what is intelligence?" To some, the litmus test for AI is how close it is to human intelligence. Others argue that additional requirements must be met for a machine to be considered intelligent. Some people say intelligence requires a conscience and that emotions are integrally tied to intelligence, while others say the ability to solve a problem requiring intelligence if it were to be solved by a human is not enough; AI must also learn and adapt to be considered intelligent.</P>
<P class="docText">AI that satisfies all these requirements is considered <span class="docEmphasis">strong AI.</span> Unlike strong AI, <span class="docEmphasis">weak AI</span> involves a broader range of purposes and technologies to give machines specialized intelligent qualities. Game AI falls into the category of weak AI.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></P><br>
<P class="docText">The bottom line is that the definition of game AI is rather broad and flexible. Anything that gives the illusion of intelligence to an appropriate level, thus making the game more immersive, challenging, and, most importantly, fun, can be considered game AI. Just like the use of real physics in games, good AI adds to the immersiveness of the game, drawing players in and suspending their reality for a time.</P>
