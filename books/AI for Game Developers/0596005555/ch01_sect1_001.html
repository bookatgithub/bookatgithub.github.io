<H3 class="docSection1Title">1.1 Deterministic Versus Nondeterministic AI</H3>
<P class="docText">Game AI techniques generally come in two flavors: <span class="docEmphasis">deterministic</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">nondeterministic.</span></P>
<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Deterministic</span></I></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Deterministic behavior or performance is specified and predictable. There's no uncertainty. An example of deterministic behavior is a simple chasing algorithm. You can explicitly code a nonplayer character to move toward some target point by advancing along the x and y coordinate axes until the character's x and y coordinates coincide with the target location.</P></DD><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Nondeterministic</span></I></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Nondeterministic behavior is the opposite of deterministic behavior. Behavior has a degree of uncertainty and is somewhat unpredictable (the degree of uncertainty depends on the AI method employed and how well that method is understood). An example of nondeterministic behavior is a nonplayer character learning to adapt to the fighting tactics of a player. Such learning could use a neural network, a Bayesian technique, or a genetic algorithm.</P></DD></DL>
<P class="docText">Deterministic AI techniques are the bread and butter of game AI. These techniques are predictable, fast, and easy to implement, understand, test, and debug. Although they have a lot going for them, deterministic methods place the burden of anticipating all scenarios and coding all behavior explicitly on the developers' shoulders. Further, deterministic methods do not facilitate learning or evolving. And after a little gameplay, deterministic behaviors tend to become predictable. This limits a game's play-life, so to speak.</P>
<P class="docText">Nondeterministic methods facilitate learning and unpredictable gameplay. Further, developers don't have to explicitly code all behaviors in anticipation of all possible scenarios. Nondeterministic methods also can learn and extrapolate on their own, and they can promote so-called <span class="docEmphasis">emergent</span> behavior, or behavior that emerges without explicit instructions. The flocking and neural network algorithms we'll consider in this book are good examples of emergent behavior.</P>
<P class="docText">Developers traditionally have been a bit wary of AI that is nondeterministic, although this is changing. Unpredictability is difficult to test and debug—how can you test all possible variations of player action to make sure the game doesn't do something silly in some cases? Game developers face an ever-shortening development cycle that makes developing and testing new technology to production-ready standards extremely difficult. Such short development periods make it difficult for developers to understand cutting-edge AI technologies fully and to see their implications in a mass-market commercial game.</P>
<P class="docText">At least until recently, another factor that has limited game AI development is the fact that developers have been focusing most of their attention on graphics quality. As it turns out, such focus on developing better and faster graphics techniques, including hardware acceleration, might now afford more resources to be allocated toward developing better, more sophisticated AI. This fact, along with the pressure to produce the next hit game, is encouraging game developers to more thoroughly explore nondeterministic techniques. We'll come back to this point a little later.</P>
