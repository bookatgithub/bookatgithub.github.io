<P class="docText">The next big thing in game AI is learning. Rather than have all nonplayer character behavior be predestined by the time a game ships, the game should evolve, learn, and adapt the more it's played. This results in a game that grows with the player and is harder for the player to predict, thus extending the play-life of the game. It is precisely this unpredictable nature of learning and evolving games that has traditionally made AI developers approach learning techniques with a healthy dose of trepidation.</P>
<P class="docText">The techniques for learning and reacting to character behavior fall under the nondeterministic AI we talked about earlier, and its difficulties apply here too. Specifically, such nondeterministic, learning AI techniques take longer to develop and test. Further, it's more difficult to really understand what the AI is doing, which makes debugging more difficult. These factors have proven to be serious barriers for widespread use of learning AI techniques. All this is changing, though.</P>
<P class="docText">Several mainstream games, such as <span class="docEmphasis">Creatures, Black &amp; White, Battlecruiser 3000AD, Dirt Track Racing, Fields of Battle</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">Heavy Gear</span>, used nondeterministic AI methods. Their success sparked a renewed interest in learning AI methods such as decision trees, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and probabilistic methods.</P>
<P class="docText">These successful games use nondeterministic methods in conjunction with more traditional deterministic methods, and use them only where they are needed and only for problems for which they are best suited. A neural network is not a magic pill that will solve all AI problems in a game; however, you can use it with impressive results for very specific AI tasks within a hybrid AI system. This is the approach we advocate for using these nondeterministic methods. In this way, you can at least isolate the parts of your AI that are unpredictable and more difficult to develop, test, and debug, while ideally keeping the majority of your AI system in traditional form.</P>
<P class="docText">Throughout this book we cover both traditional game AI techniques as well as relatively new, up-and-coming AI techniques. We want to arm you with a thorough understanding of what has worked and continues to work for game AI. We also want you to learn several promising new techniques to give you a head start toward the future of game AI.</P>
