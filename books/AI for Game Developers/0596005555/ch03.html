<H2 class="docChapterTitle">Chapter 3. Pattern Movement</H2>
<P class="docText">This chapter covers the subject of pattern movement. <span class="docEmphasis">Pattern movement</span> is a simple way to give the illusion of intelligent behavior. Basically, the computer-controlled characters move according to some predefined pattern that makes it appear as though they are performing complex, thought-out maneuvers. If you're old enough to remember the classic arcade game <span class="docEmphasis">Galaga</span>, you'll immediately know what pattern movement is all about. Recall the alien ships swooping down from the top and in from the sides of the screen, performing loops and turns, all the while shooting at your ship. The aliens, depending on their type and the level you were on, were capable of different maneuvers. These maneuvers were achieved using pattern movement algorithms.</P>
<P class="docText">Although <span class="docEmphasis">Galaga</span> is a classic example of using pattern movement, even modern video games use some form of pattern movement. For example, in a role-playing game or first-person shooter game, enemy monsters might patrol areas within the game world according to some predefined pattern. In a flight combat simulation, the enemy aircraft might perform evasive maneuvers according to some predefined patterns. Secondary creatures and nonplayer characters in different genres can be programmed to move in some predefined pattern to give the impression that they are wandering, feeding, or performing some task.</P>
<P class="docText">The standard method for implementing pattern movement takes the desired pattern and encodes the control data into an array or set of arrays. The control data consists of specific movement instructions, such as move forward and turn, that force the computer-controlled object or character to move according to the desired pattern. Using these algorithms, you can create a circle, square, zigzag, curve—any type of pattern that you can encode into a concise set of movement instructions.</P>
<P class="docText">In this chapter, we'll go over the standard pattern movement algorithm in generic terms before moving on to two examples that implement variations of the standard algorithm. The first example is tile-based, while the second shows how to implement pattern movement in physically simulated environments in which you must consider certain caveats specific to such environments.</P>
