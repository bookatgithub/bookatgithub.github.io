<H3 class="docSection1Title">3.2 Pattern Movement in Tiled Environments</H3>
<P class="docText">The approach we're going to use for tile-based pattern movement is similar to the method we used for tile-based line-of-sight chasing in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>. In the line-of-sight example, we used Bresenham's line algorithm to precalculate a path between a starting point and an ending point. In this chapter, we're going to use Bresenham's line algorithm to calculate various patterns of movement. As we did in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>, we'll store the row and column positions in a set of arrays. These arrays can then be traversed to move the computer-controlled character, a troll in this example, in various patterns.</P>
<P class="docText">In this chapter, paths will be more complex than just a starting point and an ending point. Paths will be made up of line segments. Each new segment will begin where the previous one ended. You need to make sure the last segment ends where the first one begins to make the troll moves in a repeating pattern. This method is particularly useful when the troll is in a guarding or patrolling mode. For example, you could have the troll continuously walk around the perimeter of a campsite and then break free of the pattern only if an enemy enters the vicinity. In this case, you could use a simple rectangular pattern.</P>
<P class="docText">You can accomplish this rectangular pattern movement by simply calculating four line segments. In <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>, the line-of-sight function cleared the contents of the row and column path arrays each time it was executed. In this case, however, each line is only a segment of the overall pattern. Therefore, we don't want to initialize the path arrays each time a segment is calculated, but rather, append each new line path to the previous one. In this example, we're going to initialize the row and column arrays before the pattern is calculated. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch03exm04">Example 3-4</A> shows the function that we used to initialize the row and column path arrays.</P>

<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch03exm04">Example 3-4</A> shows, we initialize each element of both arrays to a value of <span class="docEmphasis">-1.</span> We use <span class="docEmphasis">-1</span> because it's not a valid coordinate in the tile-based environment. Typically, in most tile-based environments, the upper leftmost coordinate is (0,0). From that point, the row and column coordinates increase to the size of the tile map. Setting unused elements in the path arrays to <span class="docEmphasis">-1</span> is a simple way to indicate which elements in the path arrays are not used. This is useful when appending one line segment to the next in the path arrays. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch03exm05">Example 3-5</A> shows the modified Bresenham line-of-sight algorithm that is used to calculate line segments.</P>

<P class="docText">For the most part, this algorithm is very similar to the line-of-sight movement algorithm shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02_sect1_003.html#ch02exm07">Example 2-7</A> from <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>. The major difference is that we replaced the section of code that initializes the path arrays with a new section of code. In this case, we want each new line segment to be appended to the previous one, so we don't want to initialize the path arrays each time this function is called. The new section of code determines where to begin appending the line segment. This is where we rely on the fact that we used a value of <span class="docEmphasis">-1</span> to initialize the path arrays. All you need to do is simply traverse the arrays and check for the first occurrence of the value <span class="docEmphasis">-1</span>. This is where the new line segment begins. Using the function in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch03exm06">Example 3-6</A>, we're now ready to calculate the first pattern.

<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch03_fig02">Figure 3-2</A> shows, this method of pattern movement allows for very long and complex patterns. This can be particularly useful when setting up long patrols around various terrain elements.</P>
<P class="docText">Although the pattern method used in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch03_fig02">Figure 3-2</A> can produce long and complex patterns, these patterns can appear rather repetitive and predictable. The next method we'll look at adds a random factor, while still maintaining a movement pattern. In a tile-based environment, the game world typically is represented by a two-dimensional array. The elements in the array indicate which object is located at each row and column coordinate. For this next pattern movement method, we'll use a second two-dimensional array. This pattern matrix guides the troll along a predefined track. Each element of the pattern array contains either a <span class="docEmphasis">0</span> or a <span class="docEmphasis">1</span>. The troll is allowed to move to a row and column coordinate only if the corresponding element in the pattern array contains a <span class="docEmphasis">1</span>.</P>
<P class="docText">The first thing you must do to implement this type of pattern movement is to set up a pattern matrix. As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch03exm10">Example 3-10</A> shows, you start by initializing the pattern matrix to all <span class="docEmphasis">0</span>s.</P>

<P class="docText">You have to consider one other point when moving the troll. The troll's previous location always will be in the array of valid moves.
