<H3 class="docSection1Title">5.5 Optimization Suggestions</H3>
<P class="docText">You've probably already noticed that the algorithms we discussed here can become quite computationally intensive as the number of obstacles or units in a swarm increases. In the case of swarming units, the simple algorithm shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch05_sect1_004.html#ch05exm04">Examples 5-4</A> and <A class="docLink" HREF="ch05_sect1_004.html#ch05exm05">5-5</A> is of order N<SUP>2</SUP> and would clearly become prohibitive for larger numbers of units. Therefore, optimization is very important when actually implementing these algorithms in real games. To that end, we'll offer several suggestions for optimizing the algorithms we discussed in this chapter. Keep in mind that these suggestions are general in nature and their actual implementation will vary depending on your game architecture.</P>
<P class="docText">The first optimization you could make to the obstacle avoidance algorithm is to simply not perform the force calculation for objects that are too far away from the unit to have any influence on it. What you could do here is put in a quick check on the separation distance between the given obstacle and the unit, and if that distance is greater than some prescribed distance, skip the force calculation. This potentially could save many division and exponent operations.</P>
<P class="docText">Another approach you could take is to divide your game domain into a grid containing cells of some prescribed size. You could then assign each cell an array to store indices to each obstacle that falls within that cell. Then, while the unit moves around, you can readily determine which cell it is in and perform calculations only between the unit and those obstacles contained within that cell and the immediately adjacent cells. Now, the actual size and layout of the cells would depend on your specific game, but generally such an approach could produce dramatic savings if your game domain is large and contains a large number of obstacles. The tradeoff here is, of course, increased memory requirements to store all the lists, as well as some additional bookkeeping baggage.</P>
<P class="docText">You could use this same grid-and-cell approach to optimize the swarming algorithm. Once you've set up a grid, each cell would be associated with a linked list. Then, each time through the game loop, you traverse the unit's array once and determine within which cell each unit lies. You add a reference to each unit in a cell to that particular cell's linked list. Then, instead of going through nested loops, comparing each unit with every other unit, you need only traverse the units in each cell's list, plus the lists for the immediately adjacent cells. Here, again, bookkeeping becomes more complicated, but the savings in CPU usage could be dramatic. This optimization technique is commonly applied in computational fluid dynamics algorithms and effectively reduces order N<SUP>2</SUP> algorithms to something close to order N.</P>
<P class="docText">One final suggestion we can offer is based on the observation that the force between each pair of units is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Therefore, once you've calculated the force between the pair of units <span class="docEmphasis">i</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">j</span>, you need not recalculate it for the pair <span class="docEmphasis">j</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">i</span>. Instead, you apply the force to <span class="docEmphasis">i</span> and the negative of the force to <span class="docEmphasis">j</span>. You'll of course have to do some bookkeeping to track which unit pairs you've already addressed so that you don't double up on the forces.</P>
