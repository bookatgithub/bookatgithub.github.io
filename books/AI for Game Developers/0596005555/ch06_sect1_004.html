<P class="docText">Another method of pathfinding that is very useful in game development is <span class="docEmphasis">wall tracing</span>. Like path-following, this method doesn't calculate a path from a starting point to an ending point. Wall tracing is more of an exploration technique. It's most useful in game environments made of many small rooms, although you can use it in maze-like game environments as well. You also can use the basic algorithm for tracing around obstacles, as we described in the previous section on obstacle tracing. Games rarely have every computer-controlled adversary simultaneously plotting a path to the player. Sometimes it's desirable for the computer-controlled characters to explore the environment in search of the player, weapons, power-ups, treasure, or anything else a game character can interact with. Having the computer-controlled characters randomly move about the environment is one solution that game developers frequently implement. This offers a certain level of unpredictability, but it also can result in the computer-controlled characters getting stuck in small rooms for long periods of time. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig15">Figure 6-15</A> shows a dungeon-like level that's made up of many small rooms.</P>

<P class="docText">In the example shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig15">Figure 6-15</A>, we could make the troll move in random directions. However, it would probably take it a while just to get out of the upper-left room. A better approach would be to make the troll systematically explore the entire environment. Fortunately, a relatively simple solution is available. Basically, we are going to use a lefthanded approach. If the troll always moves to its left, it will do a thorough job of exploring its environment. The trick is to remember that the troll needs to move to its left whenever possible, and not necessarily to the left from the point of view of the player. This is illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig16">Figure 6-16</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">At the start of the demo, the troll is facing right relative to the player's point of view. This is designated as direction 4, as shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig16">Figure 6-16</A>. This means direction 2 is to the troll's left, direction 6 is to the troll's right, and direction 8 is to the troll's rear. With the lefthanded movement approach, the troll always will try to move to its left first. If it can't move to its left, it will try to move straight ahead. If that is blocked, it will try to move to its right next. If that also is blocked, it will reverse direction. When the demo first starts, the troll will try to move up relative to the player's point of view. As you can see in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig15">Figure 6-15</A>, a wall blocks its way, so the troll must try straight ahead next. This is direction 4 relative to the troll's point of view. No obstruction appears straight ahead of the troll, so it makes the move. This lefthanded movement technique is shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06exm12">Example 6-12</A>.</P>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06exm12">Example 6-12</A> shows four separate <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> statement blocks. We need to use a different <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> block for each of the four possible directions in which the troll can face. This is required because the tile to the troll's left is dependent on the direction it's facing. This fact is illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig17">Figure 6-17</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig17">Figure 6-17</A> shows, if the troll is facing the right relative to the player's point of view, its left is the tile above it. If it's facing up, the tile to its left is actually the tile on the left side. If it's facing left, the tile below it is to its left. Finally, if it's facing down, the tile to the right is the troll's left.</P>
<P class="docText">As the first <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> block shows, if the troll is facing right, designated as direction 4, it first checks the tile to its left by examining <span class="docEmphasis">terrain[r-1][c]</span>. If this location contains a 1, there is no obstruction. At this point, the troll's position is updated, and just as important, its direction is updated to 2. This means that it's now facing up relative to the player's point of view. The next time this block of code is executed, a different <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> block will be used because its direction has changed. The additional <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> statements ensure that the same procedure is followed for each possible direction.</P>
<P class="docText">If the first check of <span class="docEmphasis">terrain[r-1][c]</span> detected an obstruction, the tile in front of the troll would have been checked next. If that also contained an obstruction, the tile to the troll's right would have been checked, followed by the tile to its rear. The end result is that the troll will thoroughly explore the game environment. This is illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig18">Figure 6-18</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">As you can see, following the left-handed movement method, the troll enters every room in the game environment. Although this approach is conceptually easy and in most cases very effective, it is not guaranteed to work in all cases.
