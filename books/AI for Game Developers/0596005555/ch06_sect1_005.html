<P class="docText">Pathfinding can be a very time-consuming and CPU-intensive operation. One way to reduce this problem is to precalculate paths whenever possible. <span class="docEmphasis">Waypoint navigation</span> reduces this problem by carefully placing nodes in the game environment and then using precalculated paths or inexpensive pathfinding methods to move between each node. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig19">Figure 6-19</A> illustrates how to place nodes on a simple map consisting of seven rooms.</P>

<P class="docText">In <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig19">Figure 6-19</A>, you'll notice that every point on the map is in the line of sight of at least one node. Also, every node is in the line of sight of at least one other node. With a game environment constructed in this way, a game-controlled character always will be able to reach any position on the map using a simple line-of-sight algorithm. The game AI simply needs to know how the nodes connect to one another. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig20">Figure 6-20</A> illustrates how to label and connect each node on the map.</P>

<P class="docText">Using the node labels and links shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig20">Figure 6-20</A>, we can now determine a path from any room to any other room. For example, moving from the room containing node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> to the room containing node <span class="docEmphasis">E</span> entails moving through nodes <span class="docEmphasis">ABCE</span>. The path between nodes is calculated by a line-of-sight algorithm, or it can be a series of precalculated steps. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig21">Figure 6-21</A> shows how a computer-controlled character, indicated by the triangle, would calculate a path to the player-controlled character, indicated by the square.</P>

<P class="docText">The computer-controlled character first calculates which node is nearest its current location and in its line of sight. In this case, that is node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>. It then calculates which node is nearest the player's current location and in the player's line of sight. That is node <span class="docEmphasis">E</span>. The computer then plots a course from its current position to node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>. Then it follows the node connections from node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">E</span>. In this case, that is <span class="docEmphasis">A <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> B <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> C <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> E</span>. Once it reaches the end node, it can plot a line-of-sight path from the final node to the player.</P>
<P class="docText">This seems simple enough, but how does the computer know which nodes to follow? In other words, how does the computer know that to get from node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">E</span>, it must first pass through nodes <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">C</span>? The answer lies in a simple table format for the data that enables us to quickly and easily determine the shortest path between any two nodes. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig22">Figure 6-22</A> shows our initial empty node connection table.</P>

<P class="docText">The purpose of the table is to establish the connections between the nodes. Filling in the table becomes a simple matter of determining the first node to visit when moving from any starting node to any ending node. The starting nodes are listed along the left side of the table, while the ending notes are shown across the top. We will determine the best path to follow by looking at the intersection on the table between the starting and ending nodes. You'll notice that the diagonal on the table contains dashes. These table elements don't need to be filled in because the starting and ending positions are equal. Take the upper-left table element, for example. Both the starting and ending nodes are <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>. You will never have to move from node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>, so that element is left blank. The next table element in the top row, however, shows a starting node of <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and an ending node of <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>. We now look at <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig21">Figure 6-21</A> to determine the first step to make when moving from node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>. In this case, the next move is to node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, so we fill in <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> on the second element of the top row. The next table element shows a starting node of <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and an ending node of <span class="docEmphasis">C</span>. Again, <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig21">Figure 6-21</A> shows us that the first step to take is to node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>. When filling in the table we aren't concerned with determining the entire path between every two nodes. We only need to determine the first node to visit when moving from any node to any other node. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig23">Figure 6-23</A> shows the first table row completed.</P>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig23">Figure 6-23</A> shows us that when moving from node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> to any other node, we must first visit node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>. Examining <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig21">Figure 6-21</A> confirms this fact. The only node connected to node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> is node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, so we must always pass through node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> when moving from node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> to any other node. Simply knowing that we must visit node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> when moving from node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">E</span> doesn't get us to the destination. We must finish filling in the table. Moving to the second row in the table, we see that moving from node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> requires a move to node <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>. Moving from node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">C</span> requires a move to <span class="docEmphasis">C</span>. We continue doing this until each element in the table is complete. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig24">Figure 6-24</A> shows the completed node connection table.</P>

<P class="docText">By using the completed table shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig24">Figure 6-24</A>, we can determine the path to follow to get from any node to any other node. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig25">Figure 6-25</A> shows an example of a desired path.

<P class="docText">To build a path we simply need to refer to the completed node connection table shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig24">Figure 6-24</A>. As shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig25">Figure 6-25</A>, we want to build a path from node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">G</span>. We start by finding the intersection on the table between node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> and node <span class="docEmphasis">G</span>. The table shows node <span class="docEmphasis">C</span> at the intersection. So, the first link to traverse when moving from node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">G</span> is <span class="docEmphasis">B <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> C</span>. Once we arrive at node <span class="docEmphasis">C</span>, we refer to the table again to find the intersection between node <span class="docEmphasis">C</span> and the desired destination, node <span class="docEmphasis">G</span>. In the case, we find node <span class="docEmphasis">E</span> at the intersection. We then proceed to move from <span class="docEmphasis">C <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> E</span>. We repeat this process until the destination is reached. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig26">Figure 6-26</A> shows the individual path segments that are followed when building a path from node <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> to node <span class="docEmphasis">G</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch06_fig26">Figure 6-26</A> shows, the computer-controlled character needs to follow four path segments to reach its destination.</P>
<P class="docText">Each method we discussed here has its advantages and disadvantages, and it's clear that no single method is best suited for all possible pathfinding problems. Another method we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the A* algorithm, is applicable to a wide range of pathfinding problems. The A* algorithm is an extremely popular pathfinding algorithm used in games, and we devote the entire next chapter to the method.</P>
