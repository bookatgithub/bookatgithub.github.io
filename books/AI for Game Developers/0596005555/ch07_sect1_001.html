<P class="docText">The first step in pathfinding is to define the search area. We need some way to represent the game world in a manner that allows the search algorithm to search for and find the best path. Ultimately, the game world needs to be represented by points that both the game characters and objects can occupy. It is the pathfinding algorithm's job to find the best path between any two points, avoiding any obstacles. How the actual game world will be represented depends on the type of game. In some cases, the game world might have to be simplified. For example, a game which uses a continuous environment would probably be made up of a very large number of points that the game characters would be able to occupy. The A* algorithm would not be practical for this type of search space. It simply would be too large. However, it might work if the search area could be simplified. This would involve placing nodes throughout the game world. We then would be able to build paths between nodes, but not necessarily between every possible point in the world. This is illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig01">Figure 7-1</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">The tanks in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig01">Figure 7-1</A> are free to occupy any point in their coordinate system, but for the purposes of pathfinding, the game world is simplified by placing nodes throughout the game environment. These nodes do not correspond directly to every possible tank position. That would require too many nodes. We need to reduce the nodes to a manageable number, which is what we mean when we say we need to simplify the search area.</P>
<P class="docText">Of course, we need to maintain a list of the connections between the nodes. The search algorithm needs to know how the nodes connect. Once it knows how they link together, the A* algorithm can calculate a path from any node to any other node. The more nodes placed in the world, the slower the pathfinding process. If pathfinding is taking too many CPU cycles, one alternative is to simplify the search area by using fewer nodes.</P>
<P class="docText">On the other hand, a game that uses a tiled world would be a good candidate for the A* algorithm, assuming, of course, that the world isn't unreasonably large. It would be a good candidate because essentially the world already would be divided into nodes. Each tile would be a node in the search area. This is illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig02">Figure 7-2</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">Tiled environments, such as the one shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig02">Figure 7-2</A>, are well suited to the A* algorithm. Each tile serves as a node in the search area. You don't need to maintain a list of links between the nodes because they are already adjacent in the game world. If necessary, you also can simplify tiled environments. You can place a single node to cover multiple tiles. In the case of very large tiled environments, you can set up the pathfinding algorithm to search only a subset of the world. Think of it as a smaller square within a larger square. If a path cannot be found within the confines of the smaller square, you can assume that no reasonable path exists.</P>
