<P class="docText">Ultimately, we will use path scoring to determine the best path from the starting tile to the destination tile. To actually score each tile, we basically add together two components. First, we look at the cost to move from the starting tile to any given tile. Next, we look at the cost to move from the given tile to the destination tile. The first component is relatively straightforward. We start our search from the initial location and branch out from there. This makes calculating the cost of moving from the initial location to each tile that we branch out to relatively easy. We simply take the sum of the cost of each tile that leads back to the initial location. Remember, we are saving links to the parents of each tile. Back-stepping to the initial location is a simple matter. However, how do we determine the cost of moving from a given tile to the destination tile? The destination tile is the ultimate goal, which we haven't reached yet. So, how do we determine the cost of a path that we haven't determined yet? Well, at this point, all we can do is guess. This is called the <span class="docEmphasis">heuristic</span>. We essentially make the best guess we can make, given the information we have. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig07">Figure 7-7</A> shows the equation we use for scoring any given tile.</P>

</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">So, we calculate each tile's score by adding the cost of getting there from the starting location to the heuristic value, which is an estimate of the cost of getting from the given tile to the final destination.</P>
<P class="docText">We use this score when determining which tile to check next from the open list. We will first check the tiles with the lowest cost. In this case, a lower cost will equate to a shorter path. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig08">Figure 7-8</A> shows the score, cost, and heuristic applied to each tile we have checked so far.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> value shown in each open tile is the cost of getting there from the starting tile. In this case, each value is 1 because each tile is just one step from the starting tile. The <span class="docEmphasis">h</span> value is the heuristic. The heuristic is an estimate of the number of steps from the given tile to the destination tile. For example, the tile to the upper right of the starting tile has an <span class="docEmphasis">h</span> value of 3. That's because that tile is three steps away from the destination tile. You'll notice that we don't take obstacles into consideration when determining the heuristic. We haven't examined the tiles between the current tile and the destination tile, so we don't really know yet if they contain obstacles. At this point we simply want to determine the cost, assuming that there are no obstacles. The final value is <span class="docEmphasis">c</span>, which is the sum of <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">h</span>. This is the cost of the tile. It represents the known cost of getting there from the starting point and an estimate of the remaining cost to get to the destination.</P>
<P class="docText">Previously, we posed the question of which tile to choose first from the open list on the next iteration through the A* algorithm. The answer is the one with the lowest <span class="docEmphasis">c</span> value. As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig09">Figure 7-9</A> shows, the lowest <span class="docEmphasis">c</span> value is 4, but we actually have three tiles with that value. Which one should we choose? It doesn't really matter. Let's start with the one to the upper right of the starting tile. Assuming that we are using a (row, column) coordinate system where the upper-left coordinate of the search area is position (1, 1), we are now looking at tile (5, 6).</P>

<P class="docText">The current tile of interest in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig09">Figure 7-9</A> is tile (5, 6), which is positioned to the upper right of the starting location. We now repeat the algorithm we showed you previously where we examine each tile adjacent to the current tile. In the first iteration each tile adjacent to the starting tile was available, meaning they had not yet been examined and they didn't contain any obstacles. However, that isn't the case with this iteration. When looking for adjacent tiles, we will only consider tiles that haven't been examined before and that a game character can walk on. This means we will ignore all tiles on the open list, all tiles on the closed list, or all tiles that contain obstacles. This leaves only two tiles, the one directly to the right of the current tile and the one to the lower right of the current tile. Both tiles are added to the open list. As you can see in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig09">Figure 7-9</A>, we create a pointer for each tile added to the open list that points back to its parent tile. We also calculate the <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">h</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">c</span> values of the new tiles. In this case we calculate the <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> values by stepping back through the parent link. This tells us how many steps we are from the starting point. Once again, the <span class="docEmphasis">h</span> value is the heuristic, which is an estimate of the distance from the given tile to the destination. And once again the <span class="docEmphasis">c</span> value is the sum of <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">h</span>. The final step is to add our current tile, the one at position (5, 6), to the closed list. This tile is no longer of any interest to us. We already examined each of its adjacent tiles, so there is no need to examine it again.</P>
<P class="docText">We now repeat the process. We have added two new tiles to the open list and moved one to the closed list. We once again search the open list for the tile with the lowest cost. As with the first iteration, the tile with the lowest cost in the open list has a value of 4. However, this time we have only two tiles in the open list with a cost of 4. As before, it really doesn't matter which we examine first. For this example, we will examine tile (5, 5) next. This is shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig10">Figure 7-10</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">As with the previous cases, we examine each tile adjacent to the current tile. However, in this case no available tiles are adjacent to the current tile. They all are either open or closed, or they contain an obstacle. So, as <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig10">Figure 7-10</A> shows, we simply have to mark the current tile as closed and then move on.</P>
<P class="docText">Now we are down to one single tile in the open list that appears to be superior to the rest. It has a cost of 4, which is the lowest among all the tiles in the open list. It's located at position (5, 4), which is to the upper left of the starting position. As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig11">Figure 7-11</A> shows, this is the tile we will examine next.</P>

</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig11">Figure 7-11</A> shows, we once again examine all the tiles that are adjacent to the current tile. In this case, only three tiles are available: the one to the upper left, the one to the left, and the one to the lower left. The remaining adjacent tiles are either on the open list, are on the closed list, or contain an obstruction. The three new tiles are added to the open list and the current tile is moved to the closed list. We then calculate the scores for the three new tiles and begin the process again.</P>
<P class="docText">We have added two new tiles to the open list and moved one to the closed list. The previous time we examined the open list we found that the tile with the lowest cost had a value of 4. This time around the tile with the lowest cost on the open list has a value of 5. In fact, three open tiles have a value of 5. Their positions are (5, 7), (6, 6), and (6, 4). <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig12">Figure 7-12</A> shows the result of examining each of them. The actual A* algorithm would only examine one tile at a time and then only check the additional tiles with the same value if no new tiles with lower values were discovered. However, for purposes of this example, we'll show the results of examining all of them.</P>

<P class="docText">As with the previous iterations, each new available tile is added to the open list and each examined tile is moved to the closed list. We also calculate the scores for each new tile. Traversing the open list again tells us that 6 is the lowest score available, so we proceed to examine the tiles with that score. Once again, it doesn't matter which we check first. As with <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig12">Figure 7-12</A>, we'll assume the worst-case scenario in which the best option is selected last. This will show the results of examining all the tiles with a score of 6. This is illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig13">Figure 7-13</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig13">Figure 7-13</A> shows, we examined every tile with a cost of 6. As with the previous iterations, new tiles are added to the open list and the examined tiles are moved to the closed list. Once again, the cost values are calculated for the new tiles. As you can see in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig13">Figure 7-13</A>, the value of the heuristic is becoming more apparent. The increases in the heuristics of the tiles on the lower portion of the search area are causing noticeable increases to the total cost values. The tiles in the lower part of the search area are still open, so they still might provide the best path to the destination, but for now there are better options to pursue. The lower heuristic values of the open tiles at the top of the search area are making those more desirable. In fact, traversing the open list reveals that the current lowest-cost tile now has a value of 6. In this case, only one tile has a value of 6, tile (3, 4). <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig14">Figure 7-14</A> shows the result of examining tile (3, 4).</P>

<P class="docText">Examining tile (3, 4) results in the addition of three new tiles to the open list. Of course, the current tile at position (3, 4) is then moved to the closed list. As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig14">Figure 7-14</A> shows, most of the tiles on the open list have a cost of 8. Luckily, two of the new tiles added during the previous iteration have a cost of just 6. These are the two tiles we will focus on next. Once again, for purposes of this example, we will assume the worst-case scenario in which it's necessary to examine both. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig15">Figure 7-15</A> illustrates the results of examining these two tiles.</P>

<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig15">Figure 7-15</A> shows, we are finally nearing the destination tile. The previous iteration produced five new tiles for the open list, three of which have a cost of 6, which is the current lowest value. As with the previous iterations, we will now examine all three tiles with a cost value of 6. This is shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig16">Figure 7-16</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig16">Figure 7-16</A> illustrates, we finally reached the destination. However, how does the algorithm determine when we reached it? The answer is simple. The path is found when the destination tile is added to the open list. At that point it's a simple matter of following the parent links back to the starting point. The only nodes that concern us now are the ones that lead back to the starting node. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch07_fig17">Figure 7-17</A> shows the nodes used to build the actual path.</P>

</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">Once the destination is placed in the open list, we know the path is complete. We then follow the parent links back to the starting tile. In this case, that generates a path made up of the points (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5). If you follow the algorithm we showed here, you'll always find the shortest possible path. Other paths of equal length might exist, but none will be shorter.</P>
