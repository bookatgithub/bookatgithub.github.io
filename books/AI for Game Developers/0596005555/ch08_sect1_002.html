<H3 class="docSection1Title" id="">8.2 Scripting Opponent Attributes</H3>
<P class="docText">It's common and beneficial to specify all the basic attributes of each AI opponent by using some type of scripting. This makes it easy to tweak the AI opponents throughout the development and testing process. If all the vital data were hardcoded into the program, you would have to recompile for even the most basic change.</P>
<P class="docText">In general, you can script opponent attributes such as intelligence, speed, strength, courage, and magical ability. In reality, there is no limit to the possible number or types of attributes you can script. It really comes down to the type of game you're developing. Of course, the game engine ultimately will use these attributes whenever a computer-controlled friend or foe interacts with the player. For example, an opponent that has a higher intelligence attribute would be expected to behave differently from one of lower intelligence. Perhaps a more intelligent opponent would use a more sophisticated pathfinding algorithm to track down a player, while a less intelligent opponent might become easily confused when trying to reach the player.</P>
<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08exm01">Example 8-1</A> shows a basic script you can use to set game attributes.</P>

<H5 class="docExampleTitle">Example 8-1. Basic script to set attributes</H5>
<PRE>
CREATURE=1;
INTELLIGENCE=20;
STRENGTH=75;
SPEED=50;

<P class="docText">In this example, our script parser has to interpret five commands. The first, <span class="docEmphasis">CREATURE</span>, indicates which AI opponent is being set. The next three, <span class="docEmphasis">INTELLIGENCE</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">STRENGTH</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">SPEED</span>, are the actual attributes being set. The final command, <span class="docEmphasis">END</span>, tells the script parser that we are finished with that creature. Anything that follows comprises a new and separate block of commands.</P>
<P class="docText">It would be just as easy to include the numbers <span class="docEmphasis">1</span>,<span class="docEmphasis">20</span>,<span class="docEmphasis">75</span>,<span class="docEmphasis">50</span> in a file and thus avoid any need for parsing the script text. That approach works and developers use it frequently, but it does have some disadvantages. First, you lose quite a bit of readability. Second, and most important, your scripting system can increase in complexity to the point where specifying attributes by just including their numerical values in a file becomes impractical. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08exm02">Example 8-2</A> shows how a script can become more complicated by using a conditional statement.</P>

   BEGIN
      INTELLIGENCE=20;
      STRENGTH=75;
      SPEED=50;
   END
ELSE
   BEGIN
      INTELLIGENCE=40;
      STRENGTH=150;
      SPEED=100;
   END
END

<P class="docText">As shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08exm02">Example 8-2</A>, we now have conditional statements that initialize the creature attributes to different values depending on the current game level.</P>
