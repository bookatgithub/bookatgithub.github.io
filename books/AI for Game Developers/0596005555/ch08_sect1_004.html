<P class="docText">Directly affecting an opponent's behavior is one of the most common uses of scripting in game AI. Some of the previous examples showed how scripting attributes can have an indirect effect on behavior. This included such examples as modifying a creature's intelligence attribute, which presumably would alter its behavior in the game.</P>
<P class="docText">Scripting behavior enables us to directly manipulate the actions of an AI opponent. For this to be useful, however, we need some way for our script to see into the game world and check for conditions that might alter our AI behavior. To accomplish this we can add predefined global variables to our scripting system. The actual game engine, not our scripting language, will assign the values in these variables. They are used simply as a way for the script to evaluate a particular condition in the game world. We will use these global variables in conditional scripting statements. For example, in our scripting system we might have a global boolean variable called <span class="docEmphasis">PlayerArmed</span> which will direct a cowardly troll to ambush only unarmed opponents. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08exm06">Example 8-6</A> shows how such a script might look.</P>

<PRE>
If (PlayerArmed==TRUE)
   BEGIN
      DoFlee();
   END

      DoAttack();
   END

<P class="docText">In <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08exm06">Example 8-6</A>, the script does not assign the value <span class="docEmphasis">PlayerArmed</span>. It represents a value within the game engine. The game engine will evaluate the script and link this behavior to the cowardly troll.</P>
<P class="docText">In this example, the value <span class="docEmphasis">PlayerArmed</span> is a simple boolean value that represents nothing more than another boolean value within the game engine. There certainly is nothing wrong with this, but scripting is more useful when you use simple global variables which represent a more complex series of evaluations. For example, in this sample script we checked whether the player was armed. Although that might be useful for an opponent to know, it doesn't necessarily represent how challenging the opponent will be in a fight.</P>
<P class="docText">Many factors could contribute to how challenging a potential opponent will be. We can make our scripting system even more powerful if we evaluate these conditions in the game engine and then make the result available to the script as a single global variable. For example, we could use a Bayesian network to evaluate how tough an opponent the player is and then make the result available in a variable such as <span class="docEmphasis">PlayerChallenge</span>. The script shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08exm07">Example 8-7</A> is just as simple as the one in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08exm06">Example 8-6</A>, but it can have a much more sophisticated effect on the gameplay.</P>

If (PlayerChallenge ==DIFFICULT)

<P class="docText">In the case of <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08exm07">Example 8-7</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">PlayerChallenge</span> could represent a series of complex evaluations that rank the player. Some of the factors could include whether the player is armed, the type of armor being worn, the current player's health, whether any other players in the area might come to his defense, and so on.</P>
<P class="docText">Another aspect of behavior that you can script is AI character movement. We can take a concept, such as pattern movement from <A class="docLink" HREF="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</A>, and implement it in a scripting system. For example, it might be useful for the game designer to establish patrol patterns for AI characters. <A class="docLink" HREF="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</A> showed some examples of hardcoded pattern movement. Of course, hardcoding behavior has many disadvantages. It's much more difficult to tweak a game's design if a recompile is needed after every minor change. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch08_fig01">Figure 8-1</A> shows an example of a movement pattern that a game designer can implement using a scripting system.</P>
