<P class="docText">Now we will discuss some of the methods you can use to implement a finite state machine in a game. Finite state machines actually lend themselves very well to game AI development. They present a simple and logical way to control game AI behavior. In fact, they probably have been implemented in many games without the developer realizing that a finite state machine model was being used.</P>
<P class="docText">We'll start by dividing the task into two components. First, we will discuss the types of structures we will use to store the data associated with the game AI entity. Then we will discuss how to set up the functions we will use to transition between the machine states.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.2.1 Finite State Machine Structures and Classes</H4>
<P class="docText">Games that are developed using a high-level language, such as C or C++, typically store all the data related to each game AI entity in a single structure or class. Such a structure can contain values such as position, health, strength, special abilities, and inventory, among many others. Of course, besides all these elements, the structure also stores the current AI state, and it's the state that ultimately determines the AI's behavior. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch09exm02">Example 9-2</A> shows how a typical game might store a game AI entity's data in a single class structure.</P>

<P class="docText">In <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch09exm02">Example 9-2</A>, the first element in the class refers to the entity type. This can be anything, such as a troll, a human, or an interstellar battle cruiser. The next element in the class is the one that concerns us most in this chapter. This is where the AI state is stored. The remaining variables in the structure show typical values that generally are associated with a game AI entity.</P>
<P class="docText">The state itself typically is assigned using a global constant. Adding a new state is as simple as adding a new global constant. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch09exm03">Example 9-3</A> shows how you can define such constants.</P>

<P class="docText">Now that we've seen how the AI state and vital statistics are grouped in a single class structure, let's look at how we can add transition functions to the structure.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.2.2 Finite State Machine Behavior and Transition Functions</H4>
<P class="docText">The next step in implementing a finite state machine is to provide functions that determine how the AI entity should behave and when the state should be changed. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch09exm04">Example 9-4</A> shows how you can add behavior and transition functions to an AI class structure.</P>

<P class="docText">You can see that we added two functions to the <span class="docEmphasis">AIEntity</span> class. Of course, in a real game you probably would use many functions to control the AI behavior and alter the AI state. In this case, however, two transition functions suffice to demonstrate how you can alter an AI entity's state. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch09exm05">Example 9-5</A> shows how you can use the two transition functions to change the machine state.</P>
<A NAME="ch09exm05"></A>
<H5 class="docExampleTitle">Example 9-5. Changing states</H5>
<PRE>
if ((checkHealth()&lt;kPoorHealth) &amp;&amp; (playerInRange()==false))
   state=kHide;
else if (checkHealth()&lt;kPoorHealth)
   state=kEvade;
else if (playerInRange())
   state=kAttack;
else
   state=kRoam;
</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The first <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> statement in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch09exm05">Example 9-5</A> checks to see if the AI entity's health is low and if the player is not nearby. If these conditions are <span class="docEmphasis">true</span>, the creature represented by this class structure goes into a hiding state. Presumably, it remains in this state until its health increases. The second <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> simply checks for poor health. The fact that we've reached this <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> statement means the player is nearby. If that wasn't the case, the first <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> statement would have been evaluated as <span class="docEmphasis">true</span>. Because the player is nearby, hiding might not be practical, as the player might be able to see the AI entity. In this case, it's more appropriate to attempt to evade the player. The third <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> statement checks to see if the player is in range. Once again, we know the AI is in good health; otherwise, one of the first two <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> statements would have been evaluated as <span class="docEmphasis">true</span>. Because the player is nearby and the AI entity is in good health, the state is changed to attack. The final state option is selected if none of the other options applies. In this case, we go into a default roam state. The creature in this example remains in the roam state until the conditions specified by the transition function indicate that the state should change.</P>
<P class="docText">The previous sections showed the basics of setting up a class structure and transition functions for a simple finite state machine. In the next section we go on to implement these concepts into a full-featured finite state machine example.</P>
