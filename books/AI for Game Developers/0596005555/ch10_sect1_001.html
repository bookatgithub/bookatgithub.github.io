<H3 class="docSection1Title">10.1 How Can You Use Fuzzy Logic in Games?</H3>
<P class="docText">You can use fuzzy logic in games in a variety of ways. For example, you can use fuzzy logic to control bots or other nonplayer character units. You also can use it for assessing threats posed by players. Further, you can use fuzzy logic to classify both player and nonplayer characters. These are only a few specific examples, but they illustrate how you can use fuzzy logic in distinctly different scenarios. Let's consider each example in a little more detail.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.2.1 Control</H4>
<P class="docText">Fuzzy logic is used in a wide variety of real-world control applications such as controlling trains, air conditioning and heating systems, and robots, among other applications. Video games also offer many opportunities for fuzzy control. You can use fuzzy control to navigate game units—land vehicles, aircraft, foot units, and so on—smoothly through waypoints and around obstacles. You also can accomplish as well as improve upon basic chasing and evading using fuzzy control.</P>
<P class="docText">Let's say you have a unit that is traveling along some given heading, but it needs to travel toward some specific target that might be static or on the move. This target could be a waypoint, an enemy unit, some treasure, a home base, or anything else you can imagine in your game. We can solve this problem using deterministic methods similar to those we've already discussed in this book; however, recall that in some cases we had to manually modulate steering forces to achieve smooth turns. If we didn't modulate the steering forces, the units abruptly would change heading and their motion would appear unnatural. Fuzzy logic enables you to achieve smooth motion without manually modulating steering forces. You also can gain other improvements using fuzzy logic. For example, recall the problem with basic chasing whereby the unit always ended up following directly behind the target moving along one coordinate axis only. Earlier we solved this problem using other methods, such as line-of-sight chasing, interception, or potential functions. Fuzzy logic, in this case, would yield results similar to interception. Basically, we'd tell our fuzzy controller that our intended target is to the far left, or to the left, or straight ahead, or to the right, and so on, and let it calculate the proper steering force to apply to facilitate heading toward the target in a smooth manner.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.2.2 Threat Assessment</H4>
<P class="docText">Let's consider another potential application of fuzzy logic in games; one that involves a decision rather than direct motion control.</P>
<P class="docText">Say in your battle simulation game the computer team often has to deploy units as defense against a potentially threatening enemy force. We'll assume that the computer team has acquired specific knowledge of an opposing force. For simplicity, we'll limit this knowledge to the enemy force's range from the computer team and the force's size. Range can be specified in terms of near, close, far, and very far, while size can be specified in terms of tiny, small, medium, large, or massive.</P>
<P class="docText">Given this information, we can use a fuzzy system to have the computer assess the threat posed by the enemy force. For example, the threat could be considered as no threat, low threat, medium threat, or high threat, upon determination of which the computer could decide on a suitable number of units to deploy in defense. This fuzzy approach would enable us to do the following:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">Model the computer as having less-than-perfect knowledge</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Allow the size of the defensive force to vary smoothly and less predictably</P></LI></UL>

<A NAME="ch10_sect2_003"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.2.3 Classification</H4>
<P class="docText">Let's say you want to rank both player and nonplayer characters in your game in terms of their combat prowess. You can base this rank on factors such as strength, weapon proficiency, number of hit points, and armor class, among many other factors of your choosing. Ultimately, you want to combine these factors so as to yield a ranking such as wimpy, easy, moderate, tough, formidable, etc. For example, a player with high hit points, average armor class, high strength, and low weapons proficiency might get a rank of moderate. Fuzzy logic enables you to determine such a rank. Further, you can use the fuzzy logic system to generate a numerical score representing rank, or rating, which you can input to some other AI process for the game.</P>
<P class="docText">Of course, you can accomplish this classification by other means, such as Boolean rules, neural networks, and others. However, a fuzzy system enables you to do it in an intuitive manner with fewer rules and without the need to train the system. You still have to set up the fuzzy rules ahead of time, as in every fuzzy system; however, you have to perform that process only once, and you have the linguistic constructs afforded by fuzzy logic to help you. We'll come back to this later.</P>
