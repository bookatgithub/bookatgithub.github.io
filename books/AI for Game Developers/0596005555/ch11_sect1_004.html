<P class="docText">We've only scratched the surface of rule-based systems in this chapter. Although we covered all the fundamental concepts and showed how effective rule-based systems are, other aspects to rule-based systems are worthwhile investigating if you plan to implement them for large-scale systems.</P>
<P class="docText">Optimization is one area that deserves attention. For small rule sets, forward chaining does not take much processing time; however, for larger sets of rules where many rules can match a given set of facts, it's wise to optimize the conflict resolution phase. The most common algorithm for this is the so-called <span class="docEmphasis">Rete algorithm</span>. (Check out the article "Rete: A Fast Algorithm for the Many Pattern/Many Object Pattern Match Problem," by C. L. Forgy, Artificial Intelligence, 1982.) Most textbooks on rule-based, or expert, systems cover the Rete algorithm.</P>
<P class="docText">As you saw with our fighting example, you don't have to use if-then statements in a rule-based system. You don't even have to use the sort of enumerated types or other types, such as integers, Booleans, and so on. You can use strings to represent facts in working memory and string matching routines to determine if the antecedents of a rule (also, strings) match facts stored in working memory. This approach opens the door to scripting rules outside of the compiled program, which paves the way for designers to script AI rules. Indeed, developers have been using scripting languages, such as the well-known Prolog, Lisp, and CLIPS languages, for scripting rule-based systems for decades now. (There's even a relatively new Java-based language called JESS.) Another advantage to using a scripting language to implement rule-based systems is that it's easy to change, delete, or expand upon the rules without having to modify the compiled game code.</P>
<P class="docText">Instead of using a third-party scripting language, you can write your own; however, caution is in order here. Writing a scripted rule system to handle facts that can take on a range of values, along with rules with compound antecedents and consequents that might even trigger other events, is far more complicated than writing a rule system with only Boolean facts and simple rule structures. If you'd like to see how you might go about such a task, check out <A class="docLink" HREF="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</A> of <span class="docEmphasis">AI Application Programming</span> by M. Tim Jones (Charles River Media). Note that the author's example is not a general-purpose scripting language such as Prolog and the others mentioned earlier, but it does show how to implement a simple rules-scripting algorithm from scratch. Recall that we covered basic scripting in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</A> of this book. You can apply those same techniques to writing rule-based systems, as we discussed in this chapter.</P>
<P class="docText">As for other sources of information, the Internet is replete with web pages on rule-based systems and scripting shells. If you conduct an Internet search on rule-based systems, often abbreviated RBS, you're sure to find tons of links to pages that discuss rule-based systems in some context or another. Here are some Web sites that we find helpful for beginners:</P>
