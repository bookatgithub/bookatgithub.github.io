<H3 class="docSection1Title">12.3 Probability Rules</H3>
<P class="docText">Formal probability theory includes several rules that govern how probabilities are calculated. We'll go over these rules here to lay some groundwork for the next chapter. Although we've already discussed a few of these rules, we'll restate them again here for completeness. In the discussion that follows, we state the rules in general terms and don't provide specific examples. We will, however, see these rules in action in the next chapter. If you're interested in seeing specific examples of each rule, you can refer to any introductory-level book on probability.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.2.9 Rule 1</H4>
<P class="docText">This rule states the probability of an event, <span class="docEmphasis">P(A)</span>, must be a real number between 0 and 1, inclusive. This rule serves to constrain the range of values assigned to probabilities. On one end of the scale we can't have a negative probability, while on the other end the probability of an event can't be greater than 1, which implies absolute certainty that the event will occur.</P>

<A NAME="ch12_sect2_010"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.2.10 Rule 2</H4>
<P class="docText">As sort of an extension of rule 1, if <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> represents the entire sample space for the event, the probability of <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> equals 1. This says that because the sample space includes all possible outcomes, there is a 100% probability that one of the outcomes therein will occur. Here, it helps to visualize the sample space and events using <span class="docEmphasis">Venn diagrams</span>. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch12_fig03">Figure 12-3</A> illustrates a Venn diagram for the sample space <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> and events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> within that sample space.</P>

<P class="docText">The dots represent samples taken within the space, and the relative sizes of the circles for <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> indicate their relative probabilities—more specifically, their areas indicate their probabilities.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.2.11 Rule 3</H4>
<P class="docText">If the probability that an event, <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>, will occur is <span class="docEmphasis">P(A)</span> and the event that <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> will not occur is designated <span class="docEmphasis">A'</span>, the probability of the event not occurring, <span class="docEmphasis">P(A')</span>, is <span class="docEmphasis">1- P(A)</span>. This rule simply states that an event either occurs or does not occur and the probability of this event either occurring or not occurring is 1—that is, we can say with certainty the event either will occur or will not occur. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch12_fig04">Figure 12-4</A> illustrates events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">Aapos;</span> on a Venn diagram.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.2.12 Rule 4</H4>
<P class="docText">This rule states that if two events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> are mutually exclusive, only one of them can occur at a given time. For example, in a game, the events <span class="docEmphasis">creature is dead</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">creature is alive</span> are mutually exclusive. The creature cannot be both dead and alive at the same time. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch12_fig05">Figure 12-5</A> illustrates two mutually exclusive events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>.</P>

</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">Note that the areas representing these two events do not overlap. For two mutually exclusive events, <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> or event <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring is as follows:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch12_ueq08.jpg" ALT="figs/ch12_ueq08.jpg">
<P class="docText">where <span class="docEmphasis">P(A <img src=images/ent/U222A.GIF border=0> B)</span> is the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> or event <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, the probability that one or the other occurs, and <span class="docEmphasis">P(A)</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">P(B)</span> are the probabilities of events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, respectively.</P>
<P class="docText">You can generalize this rule for more than two mutually exclusive events. For example, if <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">C</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">D</span> are four mutually exclusive events, the probability that <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">C</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">D</span> occurs is:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch12_ueq09.jpg" ALT="figs/ch12_ueq09.jpg">
<P class="docText">Theoretically you can generalize this to any number of mutually exclusive events.</P>

<A NAME="ch12_sect2_013"></A>


<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.2.13 Rule 5</H4>
<P class="docText">This rule states that if the events under consideration are not mutually exclusive, we need to revise the formulas discussed in rule 4. For example, in a game a given creature can be <span class="docEmphasis">alive</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">dead</span>, or <span class="docEmphasis">injured</span>. Although <span class="docEmphasis">alive</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">dead</span> are mutually exclusive, <span class="docEmphasis">alive</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">injured</span> are not. The creature can be alive and injured at the same time. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch12_fig06">Figure 12-6</A> shows two nonmutually exclusive events.</P>
<A NAME="ch12_fig06"></A><p><CENTER>
<H5 class="docFigureTitle">Figure 12-6. Nonmutually exclusive events</H5>
<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch12_fig06.jpg" ALT="figs/ch12_fig06.jpg">
</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">In this case, the areas for events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> overlap. This means that event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> can occur or event <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> can occur or both events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> can occur simultaneously. The shaded area in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch12_fig05">Figure 12-5</A> indicates the probability that both <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occur together. Therefore, to calculate the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> or event <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring in this case, we use the following formula:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch12_ueq10.jpg" ALT="figs/ch12_ueq10.jpg">
<P class="docText">In this formula, <span class="docEmphasis">P(A <img src=images/ent/U222A.GIF border=0> B)</span> is the probability that both <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occur.</P>
<P class="docText">You also can generalize this formula to more than two nonmutually exclusive events. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch12_fig07">Figure 12-7</A> illustrates three events, <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">C</span>, that are not mutually exclusive.</P>

</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">To calculate the probability of <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">C</span> we need to calculate the probability corresponding to the shaded region in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch12_fig07">Figure 12-7</A>. The formula that achieves this is as follows:</P>

<A NAME="ch12_sect2_014"></A>


<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.2.14 Rule 6</H4>
<P class="docText">This rule states that if two events, <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, are independent—that is, the occurrence of one event does not depend on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the other event—the probability of events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> both occurring is as follows:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch12_ueq12.jpg" ALT="figs/ch12_ueq12.jpg">
<P class="docText">For example, two independent events in a game can be <span class="docEmphasis">player encounters a wandering monster</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">player is building a fire</span>. The occurrence of either of these events is independent of the occurrence of the other event. Now consider another event, <span class="docEmphasis">player is chopping wood</span>. In this case, the event <span class="docEmphasis">player</span> <span class="docEmphasis">encounters a wandering</span> <span class="docEmphasis">monster</span> might very well depend on whether the <span class="docEmphasis">player is chopping wood</span>. These events are not independent. By chopping wood, the player presumably is in a forest, which increases the likelihood of him encountering a wandering monster.</P>
<P class="docText">Referring to Figure12-6, this probability corresponds to the shaded region shared by events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>.</P>
<P class="docText">If events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> are not independent, we must deal with the so-called conditional probability of these events. The preceding formula does not apply in the conditional case. The rule governing conditional probabilities is so important, especially in the context of Bayesian analysis, we're going to discuss it next in its own section.</P>
