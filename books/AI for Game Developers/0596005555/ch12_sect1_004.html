<P class="docText">When events are not independent, they are said to be <span class="docEmphasis">conditional</span>. For example, if you arrive home one day to find your lawn wet, what is the probability that it rained while you were at work? It is possible that someone turned on your sprinkler system while you were at work, so the outcome of your grass being wet is conditional upon whether it rained or whether someone turned on your sprinkler. You can best solve this sort of scenario using Bayesian analysis, which we cover in the next chapter. But as you'll see in a moment, Bayesian analysis is grounded in conditional probability.</P>
<P class="docText">In general, if event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> depends on whether event <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurred, we can't use the formula shown earlier in rule 6 for independent events. Given these two dependent events, we denote the probability of <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> occurring given that <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> has occurred as <span class="docEmphasis">P(A|B)</span>. Likewise, the probability of <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring given that <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> has occurred is denoted as <span class="docEmphasis">P(B|A)</span>. Note that <span class="docEmphasis">P(A|B)</span> is not necessarily equal to <span class="docEmphasis">P(B|A)</span>.</P>
<P class="docText">To find the compound probability of both <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring, we use the following formula:</P>

<P class="docText">This formula states that the probability of both dependant events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring at the same time is equal to the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> occurring times the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring given that event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> has occurred.</P>
<P class="docText">We can extend this to three dependent events, <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">C</span>, as follows:</P>

<P class="docText">This formula states that the probability of events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">C</span> all occurring at once is equal to the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> occurring times the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring given that <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> has occurred times the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">C</span> occurring given that both events <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> have occurred.</P>
<P class="docText">Often we are more interested in the probability of an event given that some other condition or event has occurred. Therefore, we'll often write:</P>

<P class="docText">This formula states that the conditional probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring given that <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> has occurred is equal to the probability of both <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> occurring divided by the probability of event <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> occurring. We note that <span class="docEmphasis">P(A <img src=images/ent/U222A.GIF border=0> B)</span> also is equal to <span class="docEmphasis">P(B) P(A|B)</span>, and we can make a substitution for <span class="docEmphasis">P(A <img src=images/ent/U222A.GIF border=0> B)</span> in the formula for <span class="docEmphasis">P(B|A)</span> as follows:</P>
