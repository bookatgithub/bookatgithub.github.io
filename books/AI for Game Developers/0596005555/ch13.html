<H2 class="docChapterTitle">Chapter 13. Decisions Under Uncertainty—Bayesian Techniques</H2>
<P class="docText">This chapter introduces Bayesian inference and Bayesian networks and shows how you can use these techniques in games. Specifically, we'll show you how to use these techniques to enable nonplayer characters (NPCs) to make decisions when the states of the game world are uncertain. We'll also show you how simple Bayesian models enable your computer-controlled characters to adapt to changing situations. We'll make heavy use of probability, so if that subject is not fresh in your mind, you might want to read <A class="docLink" HREF="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</A> first and then come back to this chapter.</P>
<P class="docText">Before getting into the details of Bayesian networks, let's discuss a hypothetical example. Suppose you're writing a role-playing game in which you enable players to store valuables in chests located around the game world. Players can use these chests to store whatever they want, but they run the risk of NPCs looting the chests. To deter looting, players can trap the chests if they have the skill and materials to set such traps. Now, as a game developer, you're faced with the issue of how to code NPC thieves for them to decide whether to open a given chest that they discover.</P>
<P class="docText">One option is to have NPCs always attempt to open any given chest. Although simple to implement, this option is not so interesting and has some undesirable consequences. First, having the NPCs always open the chest defeats the purpose of players trapping chests as a deterrent. Second, if players catch on that NPCs always will attempt to open a chest no matter what, they might try to exploit this fact by trapping empty chests for the sole purpose of weakening or even killing NPCs without having to engage them in direct combat.</P>
<P class="docText">Your other option is to cheat and give NPCs absolute knowledge that any given chest is trapped (or not) and have them avoid trapped chests. Although this might render traps adequate deterrents, it can be viewed as unfair. Further, there's no variety, which can get boring after a while.</P>
<P class="docText">A potentially better alternative is to give NPCs some knowledge, though not perfect, and to enable them to reason given that knowledge. Further, if we enable NPCs to have some sort of memory, they potentially can learn or adapt, thus avoiding such exploits as the trapped empty chest we discussed a moment ago. We'll take a closer look at this example later in this chapter. When we do, we'll use probabilities and statistical data collected in-game as NPC memory and Bayesian models as the inference or decision-making mechanism for NPCs.</P>
<P class="docText">Note that in this example, we actually can give NPCs perfect knowledge, but we introduce uncertainty to make things more interesting. In other game scenarios, you might not be able to give NPCs perfect knowledge because you yourself might not have it to give! For example, in a fighting game you can't know for sure what strike a player will throw next. Therefore, NPC opponents can't know either. However, you can use Bayesian techniques and probabilities to give NPC opponents the ability to predict the next strike—that is, to anticipate the next strike—at a success rate more than twice what otherwise can be achieved by just guessing. We'll take a closer look at this example, and others, later in this chapter. First, let's go over the fundamentals of Bayesian analysis.</P>
