<P class="docText">Let's say you're writing a game in which NPCs can loot chests potentially filled with players' treasure and other valuables. Players can put their valuables in these chests for storage and they have the option of trapping the chests (if they have the skill) along with the option of locking the chests. NPCs can attempt to loot such chests as they find them. An NPC can observe the chest and determine whether it is locked, but he can't make a direct observation as to whether any given chest is trapped. The NPC must decide whether to attempt to loot the chest. If successful, he keeps the loot. If the chest is trapped, he incurs damage, which could kill him. We'll use a simple Bayesian network along with some fuzzy rules to make the decision for the NPC.</P>
<P class="docText">The Bayesian network for this is among the simplest possible. The network is a two-node chain, as illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_fig03">Figure 13-3</A>.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">13.2.3 Tree Diagram</H4>
<P class="docText">Sometimes it's helpful to look at problems in the form of tree diagrams as well. The tree diagram for this problem is very simple, as shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_fig04">Figure 13-4</A>.</P>

</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">Looking at this tree diagram, it is clear that a chest can be locked in two possible ways and can be unlocked in two possible ways. Each branch in the tree has a corresponding probability associated with it. These are the same probabilities shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_tab02">Tables 13-2</A> and <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_tab03">13-3</A>. This diagram illustrates the compactness of Bayesian network-style graphs as opposed to tree diagrams for visualizing causal relationships. This is important for more complicated problems with greater numbers of events and possible states for each event. In such cases, tree diagrams can become unwieldy in terms of visualizing the relationships between each event.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">13.2.4 Determining Probabilities</H4>
<P class="docText">We can determine the probabilities we need葉hose shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_tab02">Tables 13-2</A> and <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_tab03">13-3</A>傭y gathering statistics during the game. For example, every time an NPC encounters a chest and opens it, the frequencies of the chest being trapped versus not trapped can be updated. The NPC effectively learns these probabilities through experience. You can have each NPC learn based on its own experience, or you can have groups of NPCs learn collectively. You also can collect statistics on the frequencies of chests being locked given they are trapped and locked given they are not trapped to determine the conditional probabilities. Because we are using discrete probabilities and because each event has two states, you'll have to develop a four-element conditional probability table as we discussed earlier. In a game, it is plausible that any given chest can exist in any one of the four states we illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_fig04">Figure 13-4</A>. For example, a player can put his valuables in a chest and lock it without trapping it because he might not have the skill or materials required to set traps. Or a player can possess skill and materials to trap the chest as well as lock it, and so on. Therefore, we can't assume that a chest always will be trapped or always will be locked, and so forth.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">13.2.5 Making Inferences</H4>
<P class="docText">In this example, we're going to use diagnostic inference. What we aim to do is answer the question, given an NPC encounters a chest what is the probability that the chest is trapped? If the NPC does not observe that the chest is locked, the probability that the chest is trapped is simply <span class="docEmphasis">p</span><SUB>T</SUB>. However, if the NPC observes the state of the chest being locked, we can revise the probability of the chest being trapped given this new information. We'll use Bayes' rule to make this revision. Bayes' rule yields the following:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch13_ueq01.jpg" ALT="figs/ch13_ueq01.jpg">
<P class="docText">Here <span class="docEmphasis">P(T)</span> represents the probability that <span class="docEmphasis">Trapped=TRUE</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">P(L)</span> represents the probability of <span class="docEmphasis">Locked=TRUE</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">P(L|T)</span> represents the probability that <span class="docEmphasis">Locked=TRUE</span> given that <span class="docEmphasis">Trapped=TRUE</span>. In English, Bayes' rule for this problem says that the probability that the chest is trapped given that the chest is locked is equal to the probability that the chest is locked given that it is trapped times the probability that the chest is trapped divided by the probability that the chest is locked. <span class="docEmphasis">P(L|T)</span> is taken from the conditional probability table. <span class="docEmphasis">P(T)</span> also is known from the probability table. However, we must calculate <span class="docEmphasis">P(L)</span>葉he probability that the chest is locked. Looking at the tree diagram in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_fig04">Figure 13-4</A>, we see that the chest can be locked in two ways: 1) given the chest is trapped; or 2) given the chest is not trapped. We can use probability rule 4 from <A class="docLink" HREF="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</A> to determine <span class="docEmphasis">P(L)</span>. In this case, <span class="docEmphasis">P(L)</span> is as follows:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch13_ueq02.jpg" ALT="figs/ch13_ueq02.jpg">
<P class="docText">Again, in words, this says that the probability of the chest being locked is equal to the probability of the chest being locked given that it is trapped times the probability of the chest being trapped plus the probability of the chest being locked given that it is not trapped times the probability of the chest being not trapped. Here the tilde symbol, ~, indicates the conjugate state. For example, if <span class="docEmphasis">P(T)</span> represents the probability that the event <span class="docEmphasis">Trapped=TRUE</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">P(~T)</span> represents the probability that the event <span class="docEmphasis">Trapped=FALSE</span>.</P>
<P class="docText">Notice that we use rule 6 from <A class="docLink" HREF="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</A> to determine the probability of <span class="docEmphasis">Locked=TRUE</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">Trapped=TRUE</span>葉hat is, <span class="docEmphasis">P(L|T) P(T)</span>. The same rule applies when determining the probability of <span class="docEmphasis">Locked=TRUE</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">Trapped=FALSE</span>葉hat is, <span class="docEmphasis">P(L|~T) P(~T)</span>. This also is the conditional probability formula we saw in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</A> in the section "Conditional Probability."</P>
<P class="docText">Let's consider some real numbers now. Say a given NPC in your game has experience opening 100 chests and of those 100 chests 37 were trapped. Of the 37 trapped chests, 29 were locked. Of the 63 chests that were not trapped, 18 were locked. With this information we can calculate the following probabilities:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch13_ueq03.jpg" ALT="figs/ch13_ueq03.jpg">
<P class="docText">Given these probabilities, we can see that there's a 37% chance that a given chest is trapped. Now, if the NPC also notices that the chest is locked葉hat is, <span class="docEmphasis">Locked=TRUE</span>葉he probability that the chest is trapped is revised as follows:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch13_ueq04.jpg" ALT="figs/ch13_ueq04.jpg">
<P class="docText">Thus, the observation that the chest is indeed locked increases the NPC's belief that the chest is trapped. In this case, <span class="docEmphasis">P(T)</span> goes from 37% to 61%. In Bayesian network lingo, the 37% probability is the prior probability, while the revised probability of 61% is the posterior probability.</P>
<P class="docText">Now suppose the NPC observes that the chest was not locked. In this case, we have:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch13_ueq05.jpg" ALT="figs/ch13_ueq05.jpg">
<P class="docText">where:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch13_ueq06.jpg" ALT="figs/ch13_ueq06.jpg">
<P class="docText">therefore:</P>
<IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="center" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch13_ueq07.jpg" ALT="figs/ch13_ueq07.jpg">
<P class="docText">This implies that the chest is less likely to be trapped because the NPC was able to observe that it was unlocked.</P>
<P class="docText">Now that you have these probabilities, how can your NPC use them to decide whether to open the chest? Let's go back to the first scenario in which the NPC observed that the chest was locked and the posterior probability of the chest being trapped was determined to be 0.61. Does 61% imply a high probability that the chest is trapped, or perhaps a moderate probability, or maybe even a low probability? We could set up some Boolean logic if-then rules to decide, but clearly this is a good job for fuzzy rules, as we discussed in detail in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</A>.</P>

<A NAME="ch13_sect2_006"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">13.2.6 Using Fuzzy Logic</H4>
<P class="docText">We can set up fuzzy membership functions such as the ones shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch13_fig05">Figure 13-5</A> for the probability that the chest is trapped.</P>
<A NAME="ch13_fig05"></A><p><CENTER>
<H5 class="docFigureTitle">Figure 13-5. Trapped membership functions</H5>
<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="images/0596005555/figs/ch13_fig05.jpg" ALT="figs/ch13_fig05.jpg">
</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">Then we can use fuzzy rules to determine what to do. For example, we can have rules to account for conditions and actions such as the following:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">If High Probability Trapped then don't open chest.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">If Low Probability Trapped then open chest.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Even better, however, is to consider other relevant information as well. For example, presumably a trapped chest causes some damage to the NPC if it is triggered; therefore, it seems reasonable to consider the NPC's health in his decision as to whether to open the chest given his belief that it is trapped. Taking this approach, we can set up rules such as the following:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">If High Probability Trapped and Low Health then don't open.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">If Low Probability Trapped and High Health then open.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">If Medium Probability Trapped and High Health then open.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">If Medium Probability Trapped and Moderate Health then don't open.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">These are just a few examples of the sort of rules you can set up. The benefit of using this Bayesian approach in conjunction with fuzzy rules is that you can give the NPCs the ability to make rational decisions without having to cheat. Further, you give them the ability to make decisions in the face of uncertainty. Moreover, NPCs can adapt to players' actions using this approach. For example, initially players can lock their chests without trapping them. However, proficient thief NPCs might learn to loot aggressively given the low risk of being hurt while opening a chest. If players start trapping their chests, NPCs can adapt to be less aggressive at looting and more selective as to which chests they open. Further, players might attempt to bluff NPCs by locking chests but not trapping them, or vice versa, and the NPC will adapt accordingly. This brings up another possibility: what if players try to fool NPCs by locking and trapping chests without putting anything of value in the chests? Players might do this to weaken NPCs before attacking them. Because stealing loot is the incentive for opening a chest, it would be cool to allow NPCs to assess the likelihood of the chest being trapped and it containing loot. NPCs could take both factors into account before deciding to open a chest. We'll consider this case in the next example.</P>
