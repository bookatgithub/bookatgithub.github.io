<P class="docText">Neural networks often are used as neural controllers for robotics applications. In these cases, the robot's sensory system provides relevant inputs to the neural controller, and the neural controller's output, which can consist of one or more output nodes, sends the proper responses to the robot's motor control system. For example, a neural controller for a robot tank might take three inputs, each indicating whether an obstacle is sensed in front of or to either side of the robot. (The range to each sensed obstacle also can be input.) The neural controller can have two outputs that control the direction of motion of its left and right tracks. One output node can set the left track to move forward or backward, while the other can set the right track to move forward or backward. The combination of the resulting outputs has the robot either move forward, move backward, turn left, or turn right. The neural network might look something such as that illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch14_fig02">Figure 14-2</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">Very similar situations arise in games. You can, in fact, have a computer-controlled, half-track mechanized unit in your game. Or perhaps you want to use a neural network to handle the flight controls for a spaceship or aircraft. In each case, you'll have one or more input neurons and one or more output neurons that will control the unit's thrust, wheels, tracks, or whatever means of locomotion you're simulating.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">14.2.2 Threat Assessment</H4>
<P class="docText">As another example, say you're writing a strategy simulation-type game in which the player has to build technology and train units to fend off or attack the computer-controlled base. Let's say you decide to use a neural network to give the computer-controlled army some means of predicting the type of threat presented by the player at any given time during gameplay. One possible neural network is illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch14_fig03">Figure 14-3</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">The inputs to this network include the number of enemy (the player) ground units, the number of enemy aerial units, an indication as to whether the ground units are on the move, an indication as to whether the aerial units are on the move, the range to the ground units, and the range to the aerial units. The outputs consist of neurons that indicate one of four possible threats, including an aerial threat, a ground threat, both an aerial and a ground threat, or no threat. Given appropriate data during gameplay and a means of assessing the performance of the network (we'll talk about training later), you can use such a network to predict what, if any, sort of attack is imminent. Once the threat is assessed, the computer can take the appropriate action. This can include deployment of ground or aerial forces, shoring up defenses, putting foot soldiers on high alert, or carrying on as usual, assuming no threat.</P>
<P class="docText">This approach requires in-game training and validation of the network, but potentially can tune itself to the playing style of the player. Further, you are alleviated of the task of figuring out all the possible scenarios and thresholds if you were to use a rules-based or finite state machine-type architecture for this task.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">14.2.3 Attack or Flee</H4>
<P class="docText">As a final example, let's say you have a persistent role-playing game and you decide to use a neural network to control how certain creatures in the game behave. Now let's assume you're going to use a neural network to handle the creature's decision-making process—that is, whether the creature will attack, evade, or wander, depending on whether an enemy (a player) is in the creature's proximity. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch14_fig04">Figure 14-4</A> shows how such a neural network might look. Note that you would use this network only to decide whether to attack, evade, or wander. You would use other game logic, such as the chasing and evading techniques we discussed earlier, to execute the desired action.</P>

</CENTER></p><br>
<P class="docText">We have four inputs in this example: the number of like creatures in proximity to the creature who's making the decision (this is an indication of whether the creature is traveling in a group or alone); a measure of the creature's hit points or health; an indication as to whether the enemy is engaged in combat with another creature; and finally, the range to the enemy.</P>
<P class="docText">We can make this example a little more sophisticated by adding more inputs, such as the class of the enemy, whether the enemy is a mage or a fighter, and so on. Such a consideration would be important to a creature whose attack strategies and defenses are better suited against one type of class or another. You could determine the enemy's class by "cheating," or better yet, you could predict the enemy's class by using another neural network or Bayesian analysis, adding a bit more uncertainty to the whole process.</P>
