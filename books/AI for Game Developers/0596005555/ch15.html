<P class="docText">It is the game designer's job to create a challenging game environment for the player. In fact, a large part of game development involves balancing the game world. It needs to be challenging enough for the players, or the game will seem too easy and they will lose interest. On the other hand, if it's too difficult, the players will become frustrated. Sometimes players can discover loopholes, or exploits, with which they essentially can cheat. This can be a result of a game design issue that the developers simply overlooked. Another game design problem stems from the fact that the skill levels of different players can vary greatly. Creating a truly balanced and challenging game for players of different skill levels can be a daunting task. Fortunately, genetic algorithms can help.</P>
<P class="docText">In this chapter, we are not going to attempt to model a true genetic system. A true genetic model probably wouldn't be practical or beneficial in a real computer game. Instead, the system we are going to discuss is merely inspired by a biological genetic system. In some ways it will be similar, but we won't hesitate to bend the rules if it benefits the game design process.</P>
<P class="docText">In the real world, species constantly evolve in an attempt to better adapt to their environments. Those that are most fit continue to survive. Charles Darwin proposed this phenomenon in 1859 in his famous work entitled "On the Origin of Species." Those that are most able to survive in their environments are able to pass on their traits to the next generation. The individual traits are encoded in chromosomes. In the next generation, these chromosomes are combined in a process called <span class="docEmphasis">crossover</span>. Crossover is a recombination of the chromosomes in the offspring. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch15_fig01">Figure 15-1</A> illustrates this process.</P>

<P class="docText">In <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch15_fig01">Figure 15-1</A> we used random letters to represent chromosomes. As you can see, each parent passes half of its genetic material on to the child. However, in the real world this crossover process might not be exact. Random mutations also can take place. This is illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch15_fig02">Figure 15-2</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">Random mutations are nature's way of trying new things. If a random mutation improves the species, it gets passed on to future generations. If not, it doesn't get passed on.</P>
<P class="docText">This constant recombination of chromosomes from the most successful members of the previous generation, combined with random mutations, creates future generations that are better adapted to survive and flourish in their environments. You can apply this same concept in games. Just as in the biological world, the elements in a game world can be made to evolve and adapt to changing situations.</P>
