<P class="docText">This first example shows how to apply a genetic algorithm to successive generations of flowers as they attempt to thrive in their environment. We define a series of hypothetical environmental conditions in which the flowers must grow. Each flower then contains genetic information that indicates its ideal growing environment. Flowers whose ideal growing environments most closely match the actual conditions grow the tallest. The tallest flowers will be considered the most fit and have their genetic information passed on to successive generations. This should result in a general increase in flower height as generations progress.</P>

<P class="docText">You can implement a crossover function in many ways. Game developers are not burdened by the limits of the biological world. In the biological world the crossover would involve the chromosomes to two fit parents. In game development, crossover can involve any number of parents. In the case of this flower evolution example, we are going to identify the least fit member of the population. The first <span class="docEmphasis">for</span> loop calls the <span class="docEmphasis">Fitness</span> function to identify the least fit member of the population. We then reassign the traits of the least fit flower to those of random members of the flower population. The next two <span class="docEmphasis">for</span> loop blocks randomly mix up the traits of the flower population. Essentially we already reassigned the traits of the least fit flower, so at this point the flower population as a whole should be an improvement over the previous generation. Unfortunately, no individual trait can be any better than it was in the previous generation because the same traits were passed on. We now need a way to try to surpass the previous generation. We accomplish this through random mutations. In the last <span class="docEmphasis">for</span> loop block, each trait of each flower has a 1% chance of randomly mutating. If the mutation is a success, the trait probably will be passed on to the next generation. If the mutation results in a flower being the least fit member of the population, it will be dropped. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch15_fig09">Figure 15-9</A> shows the end result of multiple generations.</P>

<P class="docText">As <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch15_fig09">Figure 15-9</A> shows, all the flowers are at or near their maximum heights. The area beneath the flowers also graphs the fitness of each generation. As the graph shows, there is a general upward trend in the fitness of each generation. However, not every generation was an improvement over the one before it. The graph does show some downturns. This is due to the random mutations introduced into the population. However, as the graph shows, the genetic process eventually will find the best solution to the problem.</P>
