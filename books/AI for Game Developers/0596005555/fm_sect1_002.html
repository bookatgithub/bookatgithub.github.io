<H3 class="docSection1Title" id="">About This Book</H3>
<P class="docText">We didn't hope to (nor did we attempt to) cover every aspect of game AI in this book; far too many techniques and variations of techniques are used for an even larger variety of game types, specific game architectures, and in-game scenarios. Instead, we present a mix of both deterministic (traditional) and nondeterministic (newer) AI techniques aimed squarely at beginner AI developers. Here's a summary of what we cover:</P>
<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Introduction to Game AI</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Here, we define game AI and discuss the current state of the art as well as the future of this technology.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Chasing and Evading</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">We cover basic techniques for chasing and evading as well as more advanced techniques for intercepting. We also cover techniques applicable to both tile-based and continuous game environments.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Pattern Movement</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Pattern movement techniques are common to many video games and developers have been using them since the early days of gaming. You can use these techniques to preprogram certain behaviors such as the patrolling of a guard or the swooping in of a spacecraft.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Flocking</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">The flocking method we examine in this chapter is an example of an A-life algorithm. In addition to creating cool-looking flocking behavior, A-life algorithms form the basis of more advanced group movement.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Potential Function Based Movement</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Potential-based movement is relatively new in game AI applications. The cool thing about this method is that it can handle chasing, evading, swarming, and collision avoidance simultaneously.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Basic Pathfinding and Waypoints</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Game developers use many techniques to find paths in and around game environments. In this chapter, we cover several of these methods, including waypoints.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>* <span class="docEmphasis">Pathfinding</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">No treatment of pathfinding is complete without addressing the workhorse algorithm of pathfinding; therefore, we devote this whole chapter to the A* algorithm.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Scripted AI and Scripting Engines</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Programmers today often write scripting engines and hand off the tools to level designers who are responsible for creating the content and defining the AI. In this chapter, we explore some of the techniques developers use to apply a scripting system in their games, and the benefits they receive.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Finite State Machines</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Finite state machines are the nuts and bolts of game AI. This chapter discusses the fundamentals of finite state machines and how to implement them.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Fuzzy Logic</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Developers use fuzzy logic in conjunction with or as a replacement for finite state machines. In this chapter, you'll learn the advantages fuzzy techniques offer over traditional logic techniques.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Rule-Based AI</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Technically, fuzzy logic and finite state machines fall under the general heading of rules-based methods. In this chapter, we cover these methods as well as other variants.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Basic Probability</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Game developers commonly use basic probability to make their games less predictable. Such cheap unpredictability enables developers to maintain substantial control over their games. Here, we cover basic probability for this purpose as well as lay the groundwork for more advanced methods.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Decisions Under Uncertainty—Bayesian Techniques</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Bayesian techniques are probabilistic techniques, and in this chapter we show how you can use them for decision making and for adaptation in games.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Neural Networks</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Game developers use neural networks for learning and adaptation in games—in fact, for anything from making decisions to predicting the behavior of players. We cover the most widely used neural network architecture, in detail.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Genetic Algorithms</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">Genetic algorithms offer opportunities for evolving game AI. Although developers don't often use genetic algorithms in games, their potential for specific applications is promising, particularly if they are combined with other methods.</P></DD><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor">Appendix, <span class="docEmphasis">Vector Operations</span></span></DT></p>
<DD><P class="docList">This appendix shows you how to implement a C++ class that captures all of the vector operations that you'll need when writing 2D or 3D simulations.</P></DD></DL>
<P class="docText">All the chapters in this book are fairly independent of each other. Therefore, you generally can read the chapters in any order you want, without worrying about missing material in earlier chapters. The only exception to this rule is <A class="docLink" HREF="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</A>, on basic probability. If you don't have a background in probability, you should read this chapter before reading <A class="docLink" HREF="ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</A>, on Bayesian methods.</P>
<P class="docText">Also, we encourage you to try these algorithms for yourself in your own programs. If you're just getting started in game AI, which we assume you are if you're reading this book, you might want to begin by applying some of the techniques we present in simple arcade-style or board games. You also might consider programming a <span class="docEmphasis">bot</span> using extensible AI tools that are increasingly becoming standard for first-person shooter games. This approach will give you the opportunity to try out your AI ideas without having to program all the other non-AI aspects of your game.</P>
