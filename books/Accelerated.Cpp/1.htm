<h2>Getting started</h2>
</div>
<p>Let us begin by looking at a small C++ program:</p>
<div class="prebox">
<pre>
// <i>a small C++ program</i>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
</pre></div>
<p>Programmers often refer to such a program as a <code>Hello, world!</code> program. Despite its
 small size, you should take the time to compile and run this program on your computer
 before reading further. The program should write
</p>
<div class="prebox">
<pre>Hello, world!</pre>
</div>
<p>on the standard output, which will typically be a window on your display screen. If you
have trouble, find someone who already knows C++ and ask for help, or consult our Website, 
<a href="http://www.acceleratedcpp.com">http://www.acceleratedcpp.com</a>, for advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is useful because it is so simple that if you have trouble, 
the most likely reasons are obvious typographical errors or misconceptions about how to use the 
implementation. Moreover, thoroughly understanding even such a small program can teach a
surprising amount about the fundamentals of C++. In order to gain this understanding,
we'll look in detail at each line of the program.</p>
<a name="comments">
<h3>0.1 Comments</h3>
</a>
<p>The first line of our program is</p>
<div class="prebox">
<pre>
// <i>a small C++ program</i>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>//</code> characters begin a <i><b>comment</b></i>, which extends to the end of the line. The compiler 
ignores comments; their purpose is to explain the program to a human reader. In this
book, we shall put the text of each comment in <i>italic</i> type, to make it easier for you to distinguish 
comments from other parts of the program.</p>
