<h3>16.2 Learn more</h3>
<p>Eventually, you are going to need to know more details about the language and library. 
For that matter, our ideal of learning nothing new until you understand thoroughly 
everything that we have presented so far—like most ideals—is probably not entirely 
attainable in practice. At some point, you are going to encounter a question about C++ 
that this book does not answer, so you will need to turn elsewhere for advice.</p>
<p>For this purpose, two books stand out. The first, Bjarne Stroustrup's <i>The </i>C++ <i>Programming 
Language, Third Edition </i>(Addison-Wesley, 1998), is the most complete single source of 
information about C++. It covers the entire language and library, and tells you everything 
you need to know—and probably more—about all aspects of both. The second, Matthew 
Austern's <i>Generic Programming and the STL </i>(Addison-Wesley, 1999), discusses the standard 
library's algorithms and data structures in much more detail than either our book or 
Stroustrup's. Moreover, it is authoritative, because although Austern was not the original 
author or implementer of this part of the library—that honor goes to Alex Stepanov—he 
has been working closely with Stepanov for the past several years, and is one of the main 
driving forces behind the further evolution of that library.</p>
<p>Together, this book, <i>Ruminations on </i>C++, and the books by Stroustrup and Austern 
comprise well over 2,000 pages. We are, therefore, reluctant to recommend any additional 
reading. However, if your appetite is truly voracious, we suggest that you visit 
<a href=http://www.accu.org>http://www.accu.org</a>. There, you will find reviews of more than 2,000 books, many 
of which are related to C++. They also have the good taste to give their highest recommendations 
to <i>Ruminations on </i>C++ and the books by Stroustrup and Austern.</p>
<p>As you look for reading material, keep in mind that books on the shelf do not make 
you a better programmer. Ultimately, the only way to improve your programming is to 
write programs. Have fun!</p>
<h4>Exercises</h4>
<p><b>16-0.</b> Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.</p>
<p><b>16-1.</b> Write a self-reproducing program. Such a program is one that does no input, and that,
 when run, writes a copy of its own source text on the standard output stream.</p>
