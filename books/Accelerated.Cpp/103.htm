<h3>A.2 Types</h3>
<p>Types pervade C++ programs. Every object, expression, and function has a type, and the 
type of an entity determines its behavior. With a single exception (the type of an object 
within an inheritance hierarchy that is accessed through a pointer or reference), the type 
of every entity is known at compile time.</p>
<p>In C++, types can be thought of as ways of structuring and accessing memory as well 
as ways of defining operations that can be performed on objects of the type. That is, types 
specify both properties of data and operations on that data.</p>
<p>Although this book concentrates on using and building higher-level data structures, it 
is important to understand the primitive types used to build them. These primitive types 
represent common abstractions that are close to the hardware, such as numbers (integral 
and floating point), characters (including wide characters for international character sets), 
truth values, and machine addresses (pointers, references, and arrays). Literals, also often 
called constants, represent integer, floating-point, Boolean, character, or string values. 
This section reviews and expands on facilities related to the built-in types.</p>
<h4>A.2.1 Integral types</h4>
<p>C++ inherits from C a bewildering variety of integral types, including integers, Boolean, 
and character types. Because C++ is intended to be able to run efficiently on a wide variety 
of hardware, it leaves many of the details of its fundamental types up to the implementation 
rather than defining those types precisely.</p>
<h4>A.2.1.1 Integer</h4>
<p>There are three distinct signed integer types and three distinct unsigned integer types:</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
short int              int               long int
unsigned short int     unsigned int      unsigned long int
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>short</code> and <code>long</code> types can be abbreviated by dropping the keyword <code>int</code>. The keywords, 
if there are more than one, can appear in any order.</p>
<p>Each of these types is capable of representing any integer within an implementation-
defined range. Each type but the first must offer a range at least as generous as that of the 
type that precedes it. The ranges for <code>short int</code> and <code>int</code> must be at least &plusmn;32767 
(&plusmn;(2<sup>15</sup> -1)), and the range for <code>long int</code> must be at least &plusmn;2147483647 (&plusmn;(2<sup>31</sup> -1)).</p>
<p>Every signed integral type has a corresponding unsigned type. Every unsigned 
type represents integers modulo 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>, where <i>n </i>depends on the type and the implementation. 
Analogous to the signed types, the <i>n </i>that corresponds to every unsigned type except 
<code>unsigned char</code> must be at least as large as the <i>n </i>for the preceding type. Moreover, 
every unsigned type must be capable of holding every non-negative value in the range of 
the corresponding signed type, and each signed type is required to have the same internal 
representation as the corresponding unsigned type for the values that they have in common. 
It follows from these requirements that the four unsigned types must have an extra 
bit that corresponds to signed types' sign bits, meaning that the unsigned types must correspond 
to values of <i>n </i>that are at least 8, 16, 16, and 32 respectively.</p>
<p>Compilers are allowed to use either one's- or two's-complement representation for the 
signed types.</p>
<p>The standard library defines a type called <code>size_t</code> that is a synonym for one of the 
unsigned types. It is guaranteed to be large enough to hold the size of the largest possible 
object, including arrays. Its type is defined in the system header <code>&lt;cstddef&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><b>Integer literals: </b>An integer literal is a sequence of digits, optionally preceded by a base 
indicator, and optionally followed by a size indicator. Pedantically speaking, integer literals 
do not have signs, so that <code>-3</code> is an expression, not a literal.</p>
<p>If the literal begins with <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code>, then the integer is represented in hexadecimal, and 
the &quot;digits&quot; can include any of <code>AaBbCcDdEeFf</code> as well as the usual decimal digits. If the 
literal begins with a <code>0</code> that is not followed by <code>x</code> or <code>X</code>, then the integer is represented in 
octal, and the &quot;digits&quot; can include only <code>01234567</code>.</p>
<p>The size indicator is <code>u, l, ul</code>, or <code>lu</code>, in either upper- or lowercase. If it is <code>lu</code> or <code>ul</code>, 
then the literal has type <code>unsigned long</code>. If it is <code>u</code>, then the literal has type <code>unsigned</code> 
if the value will fit; otherwise, it has type <code>unsigned long</code>. If it is <code>l</code>, then the literal has 
type <code>long</code> if the value will fit; otherwise, it has type <code>unsigned long</code>.</p>
<p>If there is a base indicator but no size indicator, then the type is the first of <code>int, unsigned, long</code>, 
and <code>unsigned long</code> into which the value will fit. If there is neither a 
size nor a base indicator, then the type is <code>int</code> if the value will fit, and <code>long</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>These rules imply that the type of an integer literal often depends on the implementation. 
Fortunately, integer literals in well-written programs tend to be small, so these 
details don't matter most of the time. Nevertheless, we have mentioned them in case you 
need to refer back to them.</p>
<h4>A.2.1.2 Boolean</h4>
<p>Expressions that are treated as conditions have type <code>bool</code>. The possible values of type 
<code>bool</code> are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. It is possible to use a number or a pointer as a truth value. In 
such contexts, zero is considered <code>false</code>, and any other value is considered <code>true</code>. 
When a <code>bool</code> value is used as a number, <code>false</code> is treated as <code>0</code> and <code>true</code> as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p><b>Boolean literals: </b>The only Boolean literals are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, each of which has type 
<code>bool</code>, with the obvious meaning.</p>
<h4>A.2.1.3 Character</h4>
<p>In C++, characters are just tiny integers. In particular, they can be used in arithmetic 
expressions in the same way as integers.</p>
<p>As is the case with integers, characters can be signed or not, so there are distinct 
<code>signed char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code> types. Every implementation's range for 
<code>signed char</code> is required to be able to contain every character in the machine's basic character set, 
as well as being at least &plusmn;127 (&plusmn;(2<sup>7</sup> -1)).</p>
<p>In addition, there is a plain <code>char</code> type, which, although it is a distinct type, is required 
to have the same representation as one of the other two types. It is up to the implementation 
to determine which of those types it should be. As usual, the choice is intended to 
reflect which representation is most natural for the machine.</p>
<p>There is also a &quot;wide character&quot; type, called <code>wchar_t</code>, which must contain at least 16 
bits, and is intended to be used for representing characters in languages such as Japanese, 
which have many more characters than the Latin alphabet provides. The <code>wchar_t</code> type is 
required to behave the same way as one of the other integral types. The particular other 
type involved depends on the implementation and is normally chosen to yield the most 
efficient representation.</p>
<p><b>Character literals: </b>A character literal, of which <code>'a'</code> is an example, is typically a single 
character surrounded by single quotes. It has type <code>char</code>, which, as we know from 
&sect;A.2.1.3/301, is really a kind of integer. Every implementation defines a correspondence 
between characters, such as <code>a</code>, and their integral values. Most programs have no reason 
to depend on that correspondence, because programmers can write literals such as <code>'a'</code> to 
mean &quot;the integer that corresponds to the character <code>a</code>.&quot; Because the correspondence 
varies from one implementation to another, programmers should not depend on arithmetic 
properties of characters. For example, there is no assurance that <code>'a'+1</code> is equal to 
<code>'b'</code>. Digits, however, are guaranteed to have contiguous values. For example, <code>'3' + 1</code> is 
always equal to <code>'4'</code> (but not necessarily equal to <code>4</code>).</p>
<p><b>String literals, </b>A string literal, of which &quot;<code>Hello, world!</code> &quot; is an example, is a sequence 
of zero or more characters surrounded by double quotes. The type of a string literal is 
<code>const char*</code>. The compiler inserts a null character at the end of every string literal.</p>
<p>Two string literals that are separated only by whitespace are automatically concatenated 
to form a longer string literal. This behavior allows string literals that span more 
than a single line to be written more conveniently.</p>
<h4>A.2.1.4 Character representations</h4>
<p>We said that a character literal is typically a single character surrounded by single quotes, 
and that a string literal is typically a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes. 
The reason for the &quot;typically&quot; is that there are some exceptions to the general rule. These 
exceptions apply equally to character literals and string literals:</p>
<ul>
<li>To represent a quote of the same kind that began the literal, you must precede it by 
another backslash, as in <code>'\''</code>, or <code>&quot;the \ quotes\&quot;&quot;</code>, to make it clear that the quote 
does not end the literal. For convenience, you can precede the other kind of quote by a backslash as well, as in <code>'\&quot;'</code>.</li>
<li>To represent a backslash, you must precede it by a backslash, as in <code>'\\'</code>, so that the 
compiler will not think that the backslash is there to give special meaning to the character 
following it.</li>
<li>There are rules having to do with international character sets, which are beyond the 
scope of this book, but which affect the meaning of programs with two or more consecutive 
question marks in their text. To make it possible to avoid consecutive question 
marks, C++ allows <code>\?</code> to represent a question mark, so that you can write literals 
such as  <code>&quot;What?\?&quot;</code> without consecutive question marks.</li>
<li>A number of control characters, which affect output in various ways, have printable 
representations inside literals: newline (<code>\n</code>), horizontal tab (<code>\t</code>), vertical tab (<code>\v</code>), 
backspace (<code>\b</code>), carriage return (<code>\r</code>), form feed (<code>\f</code>), and alert (<code>\a</code>). Their actual effect 
when written on an output device depends on the implementation.</li>
<li>If you really need a character with a particular internal representation, you can represent 
it as \x followed by hexadecimal digits (in upper- or lowercase), or by \ followed 
by up to three octal digits. So, for example, <code>'\x20'</code> and <code>'\40'</code> both represent the 
character whose internal representation is decimal 32 (20 in hex, 40 in octal). On 
implementations based on the ASCII character set, this character is the same as ' '. 
The most common use of this representation—and the only one you will see in many 
programs—is that <code>'\0'</code> is the character whose value is zero.</li>
</ul>
<h4>A.2.2  Floating point</h4>
<p>C++ has three floating-point types, called <code>float, double</code>, and <code>long double</code> in order of 
nondecreasing precision. The implementation is allowed to implement <code>float</code> with the 
same precision as <code>double</code>, or <code>double</code> with the same precision as <code>long double</code>. Every 
implementation is required to offer at least six significant (decimal) digits in the <code>float</code> 
type and ten in the <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code> types. Most implementations offer only 
six significant digits for <code>float</code> and fifteen for <code>double</code>.</p>
<p><b>Floating-point literals: </b>A floating-point literal is a nonempty sequence of digits with an 
exponent at the end, a decimal point somewhere in it, or both. Like integer literals, 
floating-point literals do not begin with a sign; <code>-3.1</code> is an expression, not a literal. The 
decimal point may be at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence of digits, or it may 
be omitted entirely if there is an exponent. The exponent is <code>e</code> or <code>E</code>, followed by an 
optional sign, and one or more digits. The exponent is always interpreted in decimal.</p>
<p>For example, <code>312E5</code> and <code>31200000</code>. represent the same number, but <code>31200000</code> is an 
integer literal, not a floating-point literal. As another example, <code>1.2E-3</code> represents the 
same number as <code>.0012</code> or, for that matter, <code>0.000012e+2</code>.</p>
<p>Floating-point literals normally have type <code>double</code>. If you want a literal to have type 
<code>float</code>, you can append <code>f</code> or <code>F</code>; if you want it to have type <code>long double</code>, you can append <code>l</code> or <code>L</code>.</p>
<h4>A.2.3 Constant expressions</h4>
<p><i>A constant-expression </i>is an expression of integral type with a value that is known at compile 
time. The operands in a <i>constant-expression </i>can contain only literals, enumerators, 
<code>const</code> variables, or <code>static</code> data members of integral type that are initialized from 
<i>constant-expressions </i>or <code>sizeof</code> expressions. The expressions may not contain functions, 
class objects, pointers, or references and are not allowed to use assignment, increment, 
decrement, function-call, or comma operators.</p>
<p>A <i>constant-expression </i>can appear wherever a constant is is expected. Examples include 
dimensions in array declarations (&sect;10.1.3/174), labels in <code>switch</code> statements (&sect;A.4/309), 
and initializers for enumerators (&sect;A.2.5/305).</p>
<h4>A.2.4 Conversions</h4>
<p>Conversions happen as needed to bring the operands of each operator to a common type. 
When there is a choice, conversions that preserve information are preferred over those 
that lose information. Moreover, conversion to unsigned types is preferred to conversion 
to signed types, all arithmetic on <code>short</code> integers or characters implies conversion to <code>int</code> 
or longer, and floating-point arithmetic implies conversion to <code>double</code> or longer.</p>
<p>The simplest conversions are promotions. Promotions allow values of a smaller type 
(e.g., <code>char</code>) to be promoted to a larger, related type (e.g., <code>int</code>); they preserve the sign of 
the initial value. Integral promotions convert values of <code>char, signed char, unsigned char, short</code>, 
and <code>unsigned short</code> to <code>int</code>, if the values will fit, and to <code>unsigned int</code> 
otherwise. Wide characters and enumeration types (&sect;A.2.5/305) are promoted to the 
smallest <code>int</code> that can represent all the values in the underlying type. The types <code>int, unsigned int, long</code>, 
and <code>unsigned long</code> are tried in order, <code>bool</code> is promoted to <code>int</code>, 
and <code>float</code> is promoted to <code>double</code>.</p>
<p>Conversion of an integral type to a floating-point type preserves as much precision as 
can be represented on the machine hardware.</p>
<p>Converting a larger signed value (e.g., <code>long</code>) to a shorter value (e.g., <code>short</code>) is implementation 
defined. Converting a larger unsigned value to a shorter value is modulo 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>, 
where <i>n </i>is the number of bits in the shorter type. Converting a floating-point value to an 
integral type truncates by discarding the fractional part. The behavior is undefined if the 
truncated value doesn't fit.</p>
<p>Pointers, integral types, and floating-point values can be converted to <code>bool</code>. If the 
value is 0 then the resulting <code>bool</code> is <code>false</code>, otherwise, it is <code>true</code>, <code>bool</code>s can be 
converted to the other types; <code>true</code> is converted as a value of 1 and <code>false</code> as 0.</p>
<p>A <i>constant-expression </i>(&sect;A.2.3/303) that evaluates to 0 may be converted to a pointer.</p>
<p>Any pointer can be converted to a <code>void*</code>. Also, a pointer to non<code>const</code> can be converted 
to a pointer to <code>const</code>—similarly for a non<code>const</code> reference. A pointer or reference 
to an object of a type that was publicly derived may be converted to a pointer or reference 
to any of its base classes.</p>
<p><b>Arithmetic conversions: </b>Because the operands can be integral or floating point, and 
signed or unsigned, it can be a little tricky to figure out the type of the result of an arithmetic 
operation. The rules for doing so are called the <i><b>usual arithmetic conversions</b>, </i>and 
work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If either operand is floating point, the result is floating point, with the precision of the 
most precise operand.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if either operand is <code>unsigned long</code>, then so is the result.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if one operand is <code>long int</code> and the other is unsigned (any unsigned type 
but <code>unsigned long</code>, which would force the result to be <code>unsigned long</code> by the previous 
rule), then the result depends on the implementation: If the range of <code>long int</code> 
contains the range of <code>unsigned int</code>, then the result is <code>long int</code>; otherwise, it is 
<code>unsigned int</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if either operand is <code>long int</code>, the result is <code>long int</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the operands must both be signed integers of <code>int</code> type or shorter, and the 
result is <code>int</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One consequence of these rules is that the result of an arithmetic operation is never <code>short</code> 
or <code>char</code>, either signed or unsigned. All arithmetic is done only on <code>int</code> or wider types.</p>
<h4>A.2.5 Enumerated types</h4>
<p>An enumerated type specifies a set of integral values. Objects of the type may take on 
only values specified by the type:</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
enum <i>enum-name</i> {
<i>enumerator [ , enumerator ] ...</i>
};
</pre></div>
<p><i>enum-name</i>s are <i>type-names </i>and can be used where a <i>type-name </i>is expected.</p>
<p>Variables of the <i>enum-name </i>type can have values only from the list of <i>enumerators:</i></p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
<i>enumerator: identifier [ = constant-expression ]</i>
</pre></div>
<p>Unless specified, the values of enumerated types correspond to consecutive integers, starting 
from zero. It is also possible to state explicit values for the enumerators. The initializers 
must have integral (&sect;A.2.1/300) type, and a value that the compiler can determine 
during compilation (&sect;A.2.3/303). If a value of an enumerated type is used in a context 
that requires an integer, the value will be converted automatically.</p>
<h4>A.2.6 Overloading</h4>
<p>More than one function can have the same name, provided that the functions differ in 
type or number of parameters.</p>
<p>Calling an overloaded function implies a compile-time check to determine which of 
the set of overloaded functions should be called. The function to call is determined by 
comparing the actual arguments at the call with the types of the formal parameters. The 
function that best matches the actual arguments is selected. To be the best match, a function 
must be a better match than the others on one or more arguments and no worse in 
any argument.</p>
<p>The best match for any particular argument is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>An exact match (the argument types are identical) is best.</li>
<li>A match using promotions (&sect;A.2.4/303) is better than a match using built-in conversions, 
which is better than a match using conversions defined by a class type 
(&sect;12.2/213 and &sect;12.5/222).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an error if there is more than one function that best matches the call.</p>
