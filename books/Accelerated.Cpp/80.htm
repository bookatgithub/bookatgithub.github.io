<h2>Using inheritance and dynamic binding</h2>
</div>
<p>The last several chapters have explored how we can build our own data types. This ability 
is one of the foundations of object-oriented programming (OOP). This chapter will 
begin a look at the the other key components of OOP—inheritance and dynamic binding.</p>
<p>In Chapter 9, we described a small class intended to encapsulate the operations used to 
solve the grading problem from Chapter 4. This chapter will revisit that problem. This 
time, we'll assume that there's a change in specification: Students can take the course for 
undergraduate or graduate credit. Obtaining graduate credit requires that the students 
do some extra work. We'll assume that in addition to the homework and exams that all 
students must complete, graduate students also have to write a thesis. As we'll see, this 
change in problem specification lends itself to an object-oriented solution, which we'll use 
to explore the language features that C++ offers to support OOP.</p>
<p>Our objective is to write new classes that will mirror these new requirements. We'd 
also like our previous solution to the grading problem, from &sect;9.6/166, to continue to 
work. That is, we'd like classes that allow us to generate the final grade report by reading 
a file of grade records and writing a formatted report using the original code.</p>
