<h3>15.1 Design</h3>
<p>We are trying to solve two distinct problems. One is a design problem등e'd like to keep 
structural information about how a picture was created. The other is an implementation 
problem등e want to store fewer copies of the same data. Both problems result from our 
decision to store a picture as a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>, so we must revisit that decision.</p>
<p>We can solve the implementation problem by managing our data with the <code>Ptr</code> class 
that we developed in Chapter 14. That class will let us store the actual character data in a 
single object, and then arrange for multiple pictures to share that same object. For example, 
if we <code>frame</code> a given picture, we will no longer have to copy the characters of the picture 
that we're framing. Instead, class <code>Ptr</code> will manage a reference count associated with 
the data, which will indicate how many other pictures are using those data.</p>
<p>The design problem is harder to solve. Each picture that we create has a structure, 
which we want to retain. We form a picture either from an initial collection of characters, 
or through one of three operations: <code>frame</code>, to produce a framed picture; and <code>hcat</code> or 
<code>vcat</code>, to create pictures that are concatenated horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>In other words, we have four similar kinds of pictures. Despite their similarity, we create 
them differently, and we would like to keep track of the differences.</p>
<h4>15.1.1 Using inheritance to model the structure</h4>
<p>Our problem is a perfect match for inheritance: We have various kinds of data structures 
that are similar to one another, but that differ in ways that we sometimes want to take into 
account. Each of our data structures is a kind of picture, which implies that inheritance is 
a sensible way to represent these data structures. We can define a common base class that 
models the common properties of every kind of picture, and then derive from that base 
class a separate class for each specific kind of picture that we want to support.</p>
<p>We'll call the derived classes <code>String_Pic</code>, for pictures created from strings that our 
user gives us; <code>Frame_Pic</code>, for a picture created by framing another picture; and 
<code>HCat_Pic</code> and <code>VCat_Pic</code>, for pictures that are the result of concatenating two other pictures 
horizontally or vertically respectively. By relating these classes through inheritance, 
we can use <code>virtual</code> functions to write code that doesn't always need to know the precise 
kind of picture on which it is operating. That way, our users can still use any of our operations 
without knowing which kind of picture is being manipulated. We will derive each 
of these classes from a common base class, which we shall call <code>Pic_base</code>, resulting in 
the following inheritance hierarchy:</p>
<center>
<img src="images/270.jpg" />
</center>
<p>The next question to resolve is whether to make the inheritance hierarchy visible to our 
users. There seems to be little reason to do so. None of our operations deals with specific 
kinds of pictures; instead, they all deal with the abstract notion of a picture. So, there is 
no need to expose the hierarchy. Moreover, because we intend to use a reference-
counting strategy, our users will find it more convenient if we hide the inheritance and 
associated reference counting.</p>
<p>Instead of making our users deal directly with <code>Pic_base</code> and its associated derived 
classes, we'll define a picture-specific interface class. Our users will access that class, freeing 
them from having to be aware of any of our implementation's details. In particular, 
using an interface class will hide the inheritance hierarchy, along with the fact that our 
class relies on <code>Ptr</code>. Apparently, then we'll need to define six classes: the interface class, 
the base class for our inheritance hierarchy, and the four derived classes. We'll call the 
interface class <code>Picture</code>. Internally, <code>Picture</code> will use a <code>Ptr</code> to manage its data.</p>
<p>What kind of <code>Ptr</code>? That is, what type of objects will the <code>Ptr</code> manage? It will manage 
our implementation class, <code>Pic_base</code>. Thus, class <code>Picture</code> will have a single data member, 
which will have type <code>Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We said that we intend to conceal our use of <code>Pic_base</code> and its related hierarchy, so 
that users will manipulate these objects only indirectly through class <code>Picture</code>, and will 
not access any of these classes directly. It turns out that the most straightforward way to 
hide these classes is to rely on the normal protection mechanisms. By giving these classes 
an empty <code>public</code> interface, we can let the compiler enforce our decision that all interactions 
with our pictures will be through class <code>Picture</code>.</p>
<p>To make these decisions concrete, let's write code that captures what we know so far:</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
// private <i>classes for use in the implementation only </i>
class Pic_base { };

class String_Pic: public Pic_base { };
class Frame_Pic: public Pic_base { };
class VCat_Pic: public Pic_base { };
class HCat_Pic: public Pic_base { };

// public <i>interface class and operations</i>
class Picture {
public:
    Picture(const std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;&amp; =
        std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;());
private:
    Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt; p;
};
</pre></div>
<p>Each <code>Picture</code> object will hold a (<code>private</code>) <code>Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;</code> object. Class <code>Pic_base</code> is 
the common base class for the four classes that will represent our four kinds of pictures. 
The <code>Ptr</code> class will manage the reference counts to allow us to share the underlying 
<code>Pic_base</code> objects. We will implement each operation on a <code>Picture</code> by forwarding that 
operation through the <code>Ptr</code> to the underlying derived-class object. We haven't thought yet 
about what these operations will be, so for now we've left the bodies of <code>Pic_base</code> 
and its derived classes empty.</p>
<p>So far, the <code>Picture</code> class is pretty simple: The only operation is to create a <code>Picture</code> 
from a <code>vector</code> of <code>string</code>s. We use a default argument (&sect;7.3/127) to make that <code>vector</code> 
optional. If a user constructs a <code>Picture</code> with no argument, then the compiler will supply 
<code>vector&lt;string&gt;()</code> as an argument automatically, which yields a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> 
with no elements. Therefore, the effect of the default argument is to allow us to use a definition 
such as</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
Picture p;       // <i>an empty </i>Picture
</pre></div>
<p>to create a <code>Picture</code> with no rows.</p>
<p>Next, we need to think about how to represent our other <code>Picture</code> operations. We 
know that we want to implement <code>frame</code>, <code>hcat</code>, and <code>vcat</code>. What we must decide is how 
to do so, and whether these operations should be members of class <code>Picture</code>. The operations 
do not change the state of the <code>Picture</code> on which they operate, so there is no strong 
reason to make them members. Moreover, there is a strong reason not to do so: As we 
saw in &sect;12.3.5/220, by making them nonmembers we can allow conversions.</p>
<p>For example, because the <code>Picture</code> constructor that we have already written is not 
<code>explicit</code>, users will be able to write</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
vector&lt;string&gt; vs;
Picture p = vs;
</pre></div>
<p>and the implementation will convert <code>vs</code> into a <code>Picture</code> for us. If we wish to allow this 
behavior드nd we do듮hen we should also allow users to write expressions such as 
<code>frame(vs)</code>. If <code>frame</code> were a member, then users would not be able to write the seemingly 
equivalent <code>vs.frame()</code>. Remember that conversions are not applied to the left 
operand of the <code>.</code> operator, so this call would be interpreted as invoking the (nonexistent) 
<code>frame</code> member of <code>vs</code>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we believe that our users will find it convenient to use an expression syntax 
to build up complicated pictures. We consider it clearer to write,</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
hcat(frame(p), p) 
</pre></div>
<p>than to write</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
p.frame().hcat(p)
</pre></div>
<p>because the first example reflects the symmetry of <code>hcat</code>'s arguments and the second 
example conceals it.</p>
<p>In addition to the functions that let us build <code>Picture</code>s, we will want to define an output 
operator that can write the contents of a <code>Picture</code>. These decisions let us flesh out the 
rest of our interface design:</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
Picture frame(const Picture&amp;);
Picture hcat(const Picture&amp;, const Picture&amp;);
Picture vcat(const Picture&amp;, const Picture&amp;);
std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp;, const Picture&amp;);
</pre></div>
<h4>15.1.2 The Pic_base class</h4>
<p>The next step in our design is to fill in the details of the <code>Pic_base</code> hierarchy. If we look 
back at our initial implementation, we'll see that we used the <code>vector&lt;string&gt;::size</code> 
function to determine how many strings were in a given picture, and we wrote a separate 
<code>width</code> function (&sect;5.8/91), which proved useful in padding the output. When we 
think about how we will display a picture, we see that we are likely to need to be able to 
perform these same operations on our classes that are derived from <code>Pic_base</code>. These 
operations will need to be <code>virtual</code>, so that we can ask any kind of <code>Pic_base</code> how many 
rows it has and how wide its widest row is. Furthermore, because our users will use the 
output operator to write the contents of a particular <code>Pic_base</code>, we can infer that we'll 
need another <code>virtual</code> function to display a given <code>Pic_base</code> on a given <code>ostream</code>.</p>
<p>The only one of these operations that needs significant insight is <code>display</code>. It is easy 
to decide that one of the parameters to <code>display</code> should be the stream on which to write 
its output, but figuring out what other parameters <code>display</code> might take requires that we 
think carefully about how it will operate. When we write a <code>Picture</code>, that <code>Picture</code> will 
comprise one or more component parts, each of which is an object of a class derived from 
<code>Pic_base</code>. If we think about writing a horizontally concatenated picture, it will be 
apparent that each row of the output from a single <code>Picture</code> might involve writing the 
corresponding row for more than one subpicture. In particular, we cannot write the 
entire contents of one subpicture, and then the entire contents of the other. Instead, we 
have to write the contents of each subpicture a row at a time, interleaved with the corresponding 
rows of the other subpictures. We can conclude, therefore, that the <code>display</code> 
function needs a parameter that says which row to write.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we <code>display</code> the left-hand part of a horizontally concatenated picture, 
we'll need to tell the corresponding subpicture to pad each row to use the full <code>width()</code> of 
itself on each line. We'll also need to tell a picture that is contained within a <code>Frame_Pic</code> 
to pad to its widest extent. On the other hand, if we're displaying a <code>Picture</code> that contains 
only a <code>String_Pic</code>, or a vertically concatenated <code>Picture</code> composed only of 
<code>String_Pic</code>s, then padding the output results only in writing a lot of unneeded trailing 
blanks. So, as an optimization, we'll pass <code>display</code> a third argument that indicates 
whether to pad the output.</p>
<p>These observations lead us to decide that the <code>display</code> function will take three arguments: 
the stream on which to generate the output, the number of the row to write, and a 
<code>bool</code> that will indicate whether to pad the picture to its full <code>width</code>. With these decisions, 
we can fill in the details of the <code>Pic_base</code> family of classes:</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
class Pic_base {
    // <i>no public interface</i>
    typedef std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;::size_type ht_sz;
    typedef std::string::size_type wd_sz;

    virtual wd_sz width() const = 0;
    virtual ht_sz height() const = 0;
    virtual void display(std::ostream&amp;, ht_sz, bool) const = 0;
};
</pre></div>
<p>We start by defining shorthand names for the <code>size_type</code>s that we'll need in our implementation. 
Thinking ahead, we can see that the underlying data will still be a 
<code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>, so the <code>size_type</code> member of <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> will be the right 
type to represent the height of a picture, and the one from <code>string</code> will be the one we 
need for the width. We'll abbreviate these types as <code>ht_sz</code> and <code>wd_sz</code> respectively.</p>
<p>The other task is to define our <code>virtual</code> functions for the base class, which you'll 
notice take a new form: In each case we say <code>= 0</code> where the body would appear. This syntax 
indicates our intention that there be no other definition of this <code>virtual</code> function. 
Why did we define these functions this way?</p>
<p>To answer this question, let's begin by thinking about what the definitions would look 
like if we tried to write them. In our design, <code>Pic_base</code> exists only to act as the common 
base class for our concrete picture classes. We will create objects of these concrete types as 
a result of executing one of the <code>Picture</code> operations, or in response to a user's creating a 
<code>Picture</code> from a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>. None of these operations directly creates or manipulates 
<code>Pic_base</code> objects. If there are never any <code>Pic_base</code> objects, then what would it 
mean to take the <code>height</code> or <code>width</code> of a <code>Pic_base</code> object (as opposed to doing so for an 
object of a type derived from <code>Pic_base</code>)? These operations are needed only for the 
derived classes, in which there always will be a concrete picture. For a <code>Pic_base</code> itself, 
there is nothing of which to take the <code>height</code> or <code>width</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of forcing us to concoct an arbitrary definition for these operations, the C++ 
language lets us say that there will be no definition for a given <code>virtual</code> function. As a 
side effect of declining to implement the <code>virtual</code> function, we also promise that there 
will never be objects of the associated type. There may still be objects of types derived 
from this type, but there are no objects of its exact type.</p>
<p>The way that we specify that we don't intend to implement a <code>virtual</code> function is to 
say <code>= 0</code>, as we did on <code>height</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>display</code>. Doing so makes it a 
<i><b>pure virtual function</b>. </i>By giving a class even a single pure <code>virtual</code> function, we are also implicitly 
specifying that there will never be objects of that class. Such classes are called <i><b>abstract base classes</b>, </i>
because they exist only to capture an abstract interface for an inheritance hierarchy. 
They are purely abstract: There are no objects of the base class itself. Once we give 
a class any pure <code>virtual</code>s, the compiler will enforce our design by preventing us from 
creating any objects of an abstract class.</p>
<h4>15.1.3 The derived classes</h4>
<p>As with <code>virtual</code> itself, the fact that a function is a pure <code>virtual</code> is inherited. If a 
derived class defines all of its inherited pure <code>virtual</code> functions, it becomes a concrete 
class, and we can create objects of that class. However, if the derived class fails to define 
even a single pure <code>virtual</code> function that it inherits, then the abstract nature is also inherited. 
In this case the derived class is itself abstract, and we will not be able to create 
objects of the derived class. Because each of our derived classes is intended to model a 
concrete class, we know that we have to redefine all of the virtuals in each of the 
derived classes.</p>
<p>The only other things we have to think about right now are what data each of our 
derived classes will contain, and the associated question of how we will construct objects 
of each type. We designed these classes to model the structure of how a picture was 
formed. The type of the picture object tells us how it was created: A <code>String_Pic</code> is created 
from character data that a user supplied to us; a <code>Frame_Pic</code> results from running 
<code>frame</code> on another <code>Picture</code>, and so on. In addition to knowing how an object was created, 
we also need to store the object(s) from which it was created. For a <code>String_Pic</code>, 
we'll need to remember the characters that the user gave us, which we can do in a 
<code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>. We create a <code>Frame_Pic</code> by framing another <code>Picture</code>, so we'll need 
to store the <code>Picture</code> that was <code>frame</code>d. Similarly, we create <code>HCat_Pic</code>s and <code>VCat_Pic</code>s 
by combining two other <code>Picture</code>s. These classes will store the <code>Picture</code>s used in creating 
the resultant new object.</p>
<p>Before settling on a design that stores Pictures in the <code>Pic_base</code> derived classes, we 
should think through the implications of this design a bit more deeply. Class <code>Picture</code> is 
an interface class intended for use by our users. As such, it captures the interface to our 
problem domain but not the implementation. Specifically, it does not have <code>height</code>, 
<code>width</code>, or <code>display</code> operations. If we think a bit about how these functions might be 
implemented, we'll see that we'll need access to the corresponding operations on the 
<code>Picture</code>(s) stored in each of the derived types. For example, to calculate <code>height</code> of a 
<code>VCat_Pic</code>, we need to add the heights of the two Pictures from which it was formed. 
Similarly, we'll obtain the <code>width</code> by finding the maximum of the <code>width</code>s of the two component Pictures.</p>
<p>An implication of storing a <code>Picture</code> in each of the derived classes is that we'll have to 
give class <code>Picture</code> functions that duplicate the <code>Pic_base</code> operations. Doing so obscures 
our initial design intent, which was that class <code>Picture</code> should be concerned with interface 
not implementation. We can maintain our design by realizing that what we need in 
the derived classes is not an interface object but an implementation object. This realization 
implies that instead of storing a <code>Picture</code>, we should store a <code>Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;</code>. This 
design keeps a clean separation between interface and implementation, while still maintaining 
our intention to reference count our implementation objects to avoid unnecessary 
data duplication.</p>
<p>Although our design is clean, enough indirection is involved that a picture may help:</p>
<center>
<img src="images/275.jpg" />
</center>
<p>Here we assume that we are generating three <code>Picture</code>s. The first <code>Picture</code> represents a 
<code>String_Pic</code> object that holds the data that we got from the user. The second one represents 
a <code>Frame_Pic</code> object that we constructed by calling <code>frame</code> on the initial <code>Picture</code>. 
Finally, we construct a <code>Picture</code> that represents the output of <code>vcat</code> run on the two previous 
<code>Picture</code>s. Each <code>Picture</code> has a single data member, which is a <code>Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;</code>. 
That <code>Ptr</code> points to an object of the appropriate <code>Pic_base</code> derived type. Each such object, 
in turn, contains either the <code>vector</code> that holds a copy of the data we got from the user, or 
one or two <code>Ptr</code>s that point to the <code>Pic_base</code> objects used to create the <code>Picture</code>. Not 
shown in this diagram are the reference counts associated with the <code>Ptr</code> objects, because 
we assume that the <code>Ptr</code> class is doing its job, and we can ignore the details of that job.</p>
<p>What's different from what we did in Chapter 5 is that only <code>String_Pic</code> contains any 
characters. The others hold one or two <code>Ptr</code>s. Therefore, we won't copy any characters 
when we create f or v. Instead, the <code>Ptr</code> will be yet another reference to the <code>Ptr</code>s in the 
<code>Picture</code>s that are used in creating a new <code>Picture</code>, and the <code>Ptr</code> class will take care of 
the reference counting for us. So, when we call <code>frame(pic)</code>, the effect is to create a new 
<code>Frame_Pic</code> object, and to point its <code>Ptr</code> at the same <code>String_Pic</code> that is stored in <code>pic</code>. 
Similarly, the <code>VCat_Pic</code> contains two <code>Ptr</code>s pointing to the <code>Frame_Pic</code> and the 
<code>String_Pic</code> respectively. We will not destroy any of these <code>Pic_base</code> objects; doing so 
is the responsibility of the <code>Ptr</code> class. It will arrange to destroy each <code>Pic_base</code> object 
when the last <code>Ptr</code> that refers to each object has gone away.</p>
<p>At this point, we should capture these design decisions in code. We know what data 
each object will contain, and we know what our operations will be:</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
class Pic_base {
    // <i>no </i>public <i>interface</i>
    typedef std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;::size_type ht_sz;
    typedef std::string::size_type wd_sz;

    // <i>this class is an abstract base class </i>
    virtual wd_sz width() const = 0;
    virtual ht_sz height() const = 0;
    virtual void display(std::ostream&amp;, ht_sz, bool) const = 0;
};

class Frame_Pic: public Pic_base { 
    //<i> no </i>public <i>interface </i>
    Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt; p;
    Frame_Pic(const Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;&amp; pic): p(pic) { }

    wd_sz width() const;
    ht_sz height() const;
    void display(std::ostream&amp;, ht_sz, bool) const;
};
</pre></div>
<p>Here we say that <code>Frame_Pic</code> inherits from <code>Pic_base</code>, and declare our intention to 
define class-specific versions of each of the three <code>virtual</code>s from that base class. Thus, 
<code>Frame_Pic</code> will not be an abstract class, and we will be able to create <code>Frame_Pic</code> objects. 
It is worth noting that we have declared these <code>virtual</code>s in the <code>private</code> section of the 
class. Doing so lets the compiler enforce our design decision that only class <code>Picture</code> and 
operations on <code>Picture</code>s can access the <code>Pic_base</code> hierarchy. Of course, because these 
<code>virtual</code>s are <code>private</code>, we may need to revisit the class definition to include <code>friend</code> 
declarations for class <code>Picture</code>, or the associated operations, as needed.</p>
<p>The <code>Frame_Pic</code> constructor needs only to copy the <code>Ptr</code> from the object that is being 
framed, which it does in the constructor initializer. The constructor body is empty, 
because there is no other work to do.</p>
<p>Continuing with our other derived classes, the concatenation classes will operate similarly 
to <code>Frame_Pic</code>: Each class will need to remember its two constituent pictures. How 
they were concatenated, vertically or horizontally, will be implicit in the type itself:</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
class VCat_Pic: public Pic_base {
    Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt; top, bottom;
    VCat_Pic(const Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;&amp; t, const Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;&amp; b): 
	    top(t), bottom(b) { }

    wd_sz width() const;
    ht_sz height() const;
    void display(std::ostream&amp;, ht_sz, bool) const;
};

class HCat_Pic: public Pic_base {
    Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt; left, right;
    HCat_Pic(const Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;&amp; l, const Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;&amp; r): 
        left(l), right(r) { }

    wd_sz width() const;
    ht_sz height() const;
    void display(std::ostream&amp;, ht_sz, bool) const;
};
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>String_Pic</code> class differs slightly from the others in that it stores a copy of the 
<code>vector&lt;char&gt;</code> that contains the picture's data:</p>
<div class="prebox"><pre>
class String_Pic: public Pic_base {
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; data;
    String_Pic(const std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;&amp; v): data(v) { }

    wd_sz width() const;
    ht_sz height() const;
    void display(std::ostream&amp;, ht_sz, bool) const;
};
</pre></div>
<p>We still copy the underlying characters from our user's <code>vector</code> parameter v into our own 
member, which is called <code>data</code>. This is the only place in our entire program that copies 
characters. Everywhere else, we copy only <code>Ptr&lt;Pic_base&gt;</code> objects, which copies pointers 
and manipulates reference counts.</p>
<h4>15.1.4   Copy control</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of our design is what isn't here. There are no copy 
constructors, assignment operators, or destructors. Why?</p>
<p>The reason is that the synthesized defaults work. The <code>vector</code> class takes care of managing 
the space for the initial copy of the characters that our user gives us as part of creating 
a new <code>Picture</code>. If we copy or assign two <code>Picture</code>s that refer to <code>String_Pic</code>s, or 
we destroy a <code>Picture</code>, then the <code>Ptr</code> operations will do the right thing to manage the 
<code>Picture</code> objects, and arrange to delete the underlying <code>String_Pic</code> at the right time. 
More generally, the <code>Ptr</code> class takes care of copying, assigning, and destroying the <code>Ptr</code> 
members in the other <code>Pic_base</code> classes드nd in class <code>Picture</code> itself.</p>
