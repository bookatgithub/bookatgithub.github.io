<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
</div>
<p>We have come to the end of the main part of our book. This ending may seem premature: 
There are still significant parts of the language, and large parts of the library, that we have 
not described. However, we have chosen to stop at this point for two important reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is that we have already presented tools that you can use to solve a 
wide range of programming problems. We believe that your best strategy at this point is 
to practice using these tools on your own problems before you learn about any more new 
tools. It might even be a good idea to begin by rereading this entire book, doing all the 
exercises that you didn't do the first time around.</p>
<p>If you are looking for ideas about programming style or technique, we recommend our 
previous book, <i>Ruminations on C++ </i>(Addison-Wesley, 1997), which contains a mixture of 
stylistic essays and programming examples.</p>
<p>The second reason is that once you have written enough programs that use the material 
that we have covered so far, you will no longer need the detailed tutorial style that we 
have adopted in this book. Instead, you will have gained enough C++ programming 
experience that you will be able to take advantage of books that contain more detailed 
information, and less explanation, than this one.</p>
