<h1>Accelerated C++ Errata</h1>

<em>Last modified 23 September 2004.</em>
<p>

Every book has bugs in it, and <cite>Accelerated C++</cite> is
no
exception.
This page notes the bugs that have come to our attention,
and the printings in which they were discovered.
All of these errors are corrected in the printing after the one in
which they were found, except that errors noted in the fifth printing
were not corrected until the ninth printing, which went to press in
August, 2004.
</p>
<p>
Please note that because of corrections, page numbers may sometimes
differ slightly from one printing to another.
So, for example, if you have a copy of the first printing, and you are
looking for a correction first noticed in the fourth printing,
you may find it on the page before or after the one cited.
</p>
<p>

</p><h2>Technical errors in the fifth printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Pages 32 and 307: The precedence table should say that the assignment and conditional
operators have the same precedence and are right-associative.
</li><li>
Page 173: In the second line from the end of the page,
<tt>*beg</tt> should be <tt>*begin</tt> (twice).
</li><li>
Page 179: The text should say that it is possible for <tt>argc</tt>to be zero.
</li><li>
Pages 191-192, 314: The types that containers are required to provide
include <tt>difference_type</tt>
</li><li>
Page 223: In the fourth line of the first complete paragraph,
<tt>iostream</tt> should be <tt>istream</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 224: In the fifth line after the second program example,
<tt>string</tt> should be <tt>Str</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 304: The text incorrectly states that <tt>float</tt> is promoted
to <tt>double</tt> as part of the standard arithmetic conversions.
</li></ul>

<h2>Clarifications in the fifth printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 24: The discussion at the bottom of the page should say explicitly
that treating a <tt>bool</tt> value as a number yields <tt>1</tt> if the
<tt>bool</tt> is <tt>true</tt> and<tt>0</tt> if the <tt>bool</tt> is <tt>false</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 216: In the code example at the bottom of the page, the call to
<tt>s.data.push_back</tt> is not the only compile error, because it is not
the only reference to <tt>s.data</tt>; there is another reference near the
beginning of the example.
</li></ul>

<h2>Typographical details in the fifth printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 57: In the fourth paragraph, the first sentence should end with
``end-of-file'' instead of ``end-of file.''
</li><li>
Page 111: In the last full paragraph, the variable named <tt>didn't</tt>
should be <tt>didnt</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 128: Near the bottom of the page, the sentence that refers to
``the data structure that <tt>split</tt> returns'' should instead
be referring to <tt>xref</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 154: There is a comma missing in the argument list of the call
to <tt>copy</tt> in the last line of exercise 8-6.
</li><li>
Page 219: The constructor of class <tt>Str</tt> should have parameters
named <tt>b</tt> and <tt>e</tt>, rather than <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt>,
to match the version on page 212.
</li></ul>

<h2>Technical errors in the fourth printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 34: In exercise 2-10, the comparison <tt>k</tt> <tt>!=</tt> <tt>n</tt>
should be <tt>k</tt> <tt>!=</tt> <tt>10</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 70: The invariant near the bottom of the page should refer to
<tt>maxlen</tt> rather than <tt>max</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 174: In the third line from the bottom, <tt>coord</tt> <tt>+</tt> <tt>1</tt>
should be <tt>coords</tt> <tt>+</tt> <tt>1</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 183: In the comment in the code example near the bottom of the page,
<tt>p</tt> should be <tt>*p</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 190: In the last code example on the page, <tt>size_type</tt>
should be <tt>std::size_t</tt>.
Note that the similar example on page 193 is correct as it stands,
because <tt>size_type</tt> has now been defined.
</li><li>
Page 239: The call to <tt>students[i].grade()</tt> is dynamically bound,
not statically bound.  However, because the type of <tt>students[i]</tt> is known
during compilation, the effect is the same as that of static binding.
</li><li>
Page 264: The first code example should call <tt>s1.read(cin)</tt>
rather than <tt>read(cin,</tt> <tt>s1)</tt>, and similarly for <tt>s2</tt>.
</li><li>
Pages 265-266: The text sometimes mentions the standard <tt>vector</tt> class
when it should refer to the <tt>Vec</tt> class that we are defining.
</li><li>
Page 280: The last code example has a spurious semicolon at the end.
</li><li>
Page 281: The first complete paragraph should note that <tt>Pic</tt>
must also be a friend.
</li><li>
Page 304: The list of conversions is missing an entry, just before the last one.
It should say: ``Otherwise, if either operand is <tt>unsigned</tt> <tt>int</tt>,
the result is <tt>unsigned</tt> <tt>int</tt>.''
It also needs to mention the integral promotions.
</li><li>
Page 307: The description of compound assignment should say
<tt>x</tt> <em>op</em><tt>=</tt> <tt>y</tt>
instead of
<tt>x</tt> <em>op</em><tt>=</tt> <tt>x</tt>
</li></ul>

<h2>Typographical details in the fourth printing</h2>
<ul>
The code examples are not consistent about whether to put a space
after <tt>template</tt>; that is, whether to say
<ol><tt>template&lt;class T&gt; class Vec { /* ... */ };</tt></ol>
or
<ol><tt>template &lt;class T&gt; class Vec { /* ... */ };</tt></ol>

Fortunately, it's correct either way.
</ul>

<h2>Clarifications in the fourth printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Pages 32 and 307: The description of compound assignments in the table should enumerate the
operators explicitly.
The description of <tt>%</tt> should say that the operands must be integers.
</li><li>
Page 100: In exercise 5-9, it's not clear whether a word containing mixed-case
letters is uppercase or lowercase.
The exercise should be to write all the words in the input that do not contain
any uppercase letters, followed by all the words that contain one or more uppercase letters.
</li><li>
Page 179: The program at the bottom of the page can be made easier to understand
by writing <tt>argv[1]</tt> as a special case, and then printing a space
<em>before</em> each subsequent argument, if any.
</li><li>
Pages 260 and 263: The initializations of <tt>p</tt> and <tt>refptr</tt>
are clearer if they appear in the same order as the definitions of the
data members themselves.
</li></ul>


<h2>Technical errors in the third printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 47: The invariant in the comment on the third line of the page
should say that <tt>homework</tt> contains all the homework grades read
so far, rather than all the grades.
Similarly for the invariant in the comment near the bottom of page 70.
</li><li>
Page 100: In exercise 5-6, <tt>v</tt> should be <tt>students</tt> throughout.
</li><li>
Page 136: In the first complete paragraph on the page, the third sentence should
refer to ``the body'' rather than ``the <tt>push_back</tt>.''
</li><li>
Pages 167, 238, 241, 248, and 258: <tt>students.name.size()</tt>
should be <tt>students.name().size()</tt> instead.
</li><li>
Page 186: <tt>&lt;ifstream&gt;</tt> should be <tt>&lt;fstream&gt;</tt>
</li><li>
Page 191: Containers need to define <tt>reference</tt> and <tt>const_reference</tt>
as well as <tt>value_type</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 203: In the last paragraph before the code example,
<tt>size</tt> and <tt>end</tt> need to know about the new member
as well.
</li><li>
Page 206: The comments in the code example should reflect that the
definitions of <tt>size</tt> and <tt>end</tt> are changed.
</li><li>
Page 209: The last sentence of the second paragraph swaps the descriptions of
<tt>limit</tt> and <tt>avail</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 213: On the third line of the first code example, the comment
should refer to <tt>d2</tt> instead of <tt>d</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 222: The declaration of <tt>operator</tt> <tt>double</tt> in the
first code example should have a <tt>const</tt> immediately before the semicolon.
</li><li>
Pages 258 and 259: In the example that spans those pages,
<tt>runtime_error</tt> should be <tt>std::runtime_error</tt>.
</li><li>
Pages 261 and 263:  The definition of <tt>refptr</tt> should mention
<tt>std::size_t</tt> rather than <tt>size_t</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 264:  In the last example before the start of section 14.4,
<tt>run_time_error</tt> should be <tt>runtime_error</tt>.
</li><li>
Pages 271, 273, and 276: Class <tt>Pic_base</tt> should have an empty virtual destructor.
</li><li>
Page 277: In the sentence before the last code example,
<tt>vector&lt;char&gt;</tt> should be <tt>vector&lt;string&gt;</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 281: The second code example should refer to <tt>std::max</tt>
rather than just <tt>max</tt>.
</li></ul>

<h2>Clarifications in the third printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 28: It should be explicit that we are talking about the values
that <tt>r</tt> takes on in the loop bodies, not what value it
might have after the loop completes.
</li><li>
Page 73: Exercise 4-6 should ask the reader to rewrite the
<tt>read</tt> and <tt>grade</tt> functions as well as the
<tt>Student_info</tt> structure.
</li><li>
Page 154: The <tt>xref</tt> function doesn't return a <tt>vector&lt;string&gt;</tt>,
so exercise 8-5 should describe the current behavior as ``placing their entire
output in a data structure.''
</li><li>
Page 165: The discussion at the bottom of the page should say explicitly
that initialization takes place in the order of declaration, not in
the order of the member-initializer list.
</li><li>
Page 184: The discussion of off-the-end pointers in the third paragraph
of 10.6.2 should refer to the earlier discussion on page 149.
</li><li>
Page 190: The comments in the first example should make it clear that
the definitions use the cited constructors, rather than defining them.
</li><li>
Page 191: In section 11.2.3, paragraph 2, the first sentence refers
to ``the type of the objects that the container stores.''
It is clearer to refer to ``the type of each object that the container stores.''
</li><li>
Page 258: In order to use the <tt>Handle</tt> class, it is necessary to
change the Core class to allow <tt>Handle&lt;core&gt;</tt> to use the <tt>clone</tt>
member, either by making <tt>Handle&lt;core&gt;</tt> a friend of <tt>Core</tt>
or by making the <tt>clone</tt> member <tt>public</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 306: The description of operators that guarantee order of
evaluation should include the comma operator (correctly described at the
bottom of the table on page 307).
</li></ul>

<h2>Typographical details in the third printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 128: In the penultimate comment in the code example,
``lines numbers'' should be ``line numbers.''
</li><li>
Page 164: The last line of the fourth paragraph has an extra word ``a'' in it.
</li><li>
Page 192: In the last line of the page, ``It the operator...'' should be
``If the operator...''
</li><li>
Page 247: There should not be a space between ``<tt>friend</tt>''
and ``ship'' at the end of the first complete paragraph.
</li><li>
Pages 292 and 294: The chapter title at the top of the page is missing
a question mark.
</li><li>
Page 296: In the paragraph beginning ``C++ inherits its'' near the
middle of the page, there is a missing word ``by'' after ``followed''
in the third line.
</li><li>
Page 297: The first line of the definition of <em>type-specifier</em> should end with an
``or'' (|) symbol.
</li><li>
Page 303: The word ``is'' appears twice in a row in section A.2.3,
paragraph 2, line 1.
</li></ul>

<h2>Technical errors in the second printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 22, first paragraph, last line: ``true'' should be ``false''
</li><li>
Page 32, near the end of the table: <tt>x</tt> <em>op</em><tt>=</tt> <tt>x</tt>
should be <tt>x</tt> <em>op</em><tt>=</tt> <tt>y</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 33: The equivalence between <tt>for</tt> and <tt>while</tt> statements
is not exact if the <em>statement</em> is or contains a <tt>continue</tt> statement.
</li><li>
Page 34: In the description
<ol><tt>if (</tt><em>&lt;condition&gt;</em><tt>) </tt><em>statement</em><tt>; else </tt><em>statement2</em></ol>
there should be no semicolon, because the <em>statement</em> will usually have
one of its own.
</li><li>
Page 48, just before 3.3: The execution time of <tt>sort</tt> is guaranteed in
the average case, but it is possible for it to run more slowly with
pathological input.
</li><li>
Page 64: The 11th line from the bottom is missing some characters:
<ol><tt>&lt;&lt; string(maxlen + 1 - students[i].name.size(), '</tt></ol>
should be
<ol><tt>&lt;&lt; string(maxlen + 1 - students[i].name.size(), ' ');</tt></ol>
</li><li>
Page 70, 7 lines from the bottom:
<tt>vs</tt> should be <tt>students</tt> in the comment on that line.
</li><li>
Page 97: <tt>erase</tt> returns an iterator referring to the position
immediately after the erasure.
<tt>c[n]</tt> refers to a container element, not necessarily a character.
</li><li>
Page 116, two paragraphs before the beginning of section 6.3:
The first reference to <tt>v</tt> in that paragraph should refer to
<tt>s.homework</tt> instead, as should the reference to <tt>v</tt>
in the comment in the code example.
The last two references to
should refer to <tt>nonzero</tt> instead.
</li><li>
Page 120: The last code example should call <tt>students.erase</tt>,
not <tt>v.erase</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 135: In the last line of the first paragraph of section 7.4.4,
<tt>&lt;</tt> should be <tt>&lt;=</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 190, last line on the page:  <tt>vector</tt> should be <tt>Vec</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 204, code example: The second parameter for <tt>construct</tt> should be
<tt>const</tt> <tt>T&amp;</tt>, not <tt>T</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 205, the declarations of <tt>uninitialized_copy</tt> and <tt>uninitialized_fill</tt>
should be
<ul><tt>
template&lt;class In, class Out&gt; Out uninitialized_copy(In, In, Out);
<br>
template&lt;class Out, class T&gt; void uninitialized_fill(Out, Out, const T&amp;);
</tt></ul>
where <tt>In</tt> is an input-iterator type and
<tt>Out</tt> is a forward-iterator type.
</li><li>
Page 213, just after the last code example:  The second sentence should
say ``The first statement defines <tt>t</tt>...'' instead of referring to <tt>s</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 257, two lines before the beginning of section 14.1.2:
<tt>student.grade()</tt> should be <tt>(*student).grade()</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 283, last example: The <tt>width</tt> function
should call <tt>std::max</tt> explicitly instead of plain <tt>max</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 284, last example: The <tt>height</tt> function
should call <tt>std::max</tt> explicitly instead of plain <tt>max</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Page 330, the index entry for <tt>http://www.accu.org</tt> should refer to
page 294 (where the URL actually appears) rather than page 293
(where the section begins that contains the URL).
</li>
<li>
Page 307: Near the bottom of the table, <tt>x</tt> <em>op</em><tt>=</tt> <tt>x</tt>
should be <tt>x</tt> <em>op</em><tt>=</tt> <tt>y</tt>
</li></ul>

<h2>Clarifications in the second printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 44 uses the term ``(one past)'' without explaining it.
The idea is that if <tt>c</tt> is a container, <tt>c.end()</tt> does not
refer to the last element, but rather to the imaginary location where
the element after the last one would be if it existed.
</li><li>
Page 76, last paragraph before section 5.1.1: The text should make it clear
that assigning a new value to <tt>students</tt> overwrites the previous contents.
</li><li>
Page 103, immediately after the first example: ``third argument is an iterator''
is clearer if replaced by ``third parameter is required to be an iterator''.
</li><li>
Page 107, just after the last example:  It is clearer to say that
<tt>static</tt> local variables are ``constructed'' than that they are ``created,''
because the storage that the variable occupies is supposed to be allocated
when the program begins execution.
</li><li>
Page 135: The explanation of <tt>nrand</tt> could be clearer.
</li><li>
Page 142: The second paragraph of section 8.1.2 could be clearer.
</li><li>
Page 151: The description of <tt>ostream_iterator</tt> does not make it clear
that the second argument must have type <tt>const</tt> <tt>char*</tt>.
In particular, it cannot be a <tt>string</tt> or a character literal.
</li><li>
Page 154: In exercise 8-2, <tt>equal(b,</tt> <tt>e,</tt> <tt>d)</tt>
would be clearer as <tt>equal(b,</tt> <tt>e,</tt> <tt>b2)</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 195, just before the last code example: It should be clearer that
we are referring to the copy constructor, as opposed to other constructors.
</li><li>
Page 201, second paragraph of section 11.3.5: The second sentence
should be clearer.
</li><li>
Page 202, last line before the example: the word ``copy'' is ambiguous.


</li></ul>


<h2>Typographical details in the second printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In various places, <tt>container&lt;T&gt;</tt> should really appear as
<em>container</em><tt>&lt;T&gt;</tt> because there is no standard type named
<tt>container</tt>; instead, <em>container</em> refers to the name of any
standard-library container class.
</li><li>
Page 11: The second-to-last paragraph in the section just before 1.2
should have ``Our'' instead of ``Out'' as its first word.
</li><li>
Page 21: In the line just before the code example, ``what know''
should be ``what we know''.
</li><li>
Page 45, second paragraph before the diagram, ``average of value'' in the
last line of that paragraph should be ``average value''.
</li><li>
Page 51: In the seventh line from the bottom, the word ``same'' appears twice in succession.
</li><li>
Page 66: In the fourth line from the bottom, the word ``about''
appears twice in a row.
</li><li>
Page 104: It is useful for the first paragraph to include a reference back to page 88.
</li><li>
Page 139: In the penultimate line, ``constrains'' should be ``constrain.''
</li><li>
Page 152: The penultimate comment in the first code example is in the wrong font.
</li><li>
Page 250, three lines before the last code example: ``(<tt>publicly</tt>)''
should be ``(<tt>public</tt>ly)''.
</li></ul>

<h2>Technical errors in the first printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The calls to <tt>setw</tt>, such as the one near the bottom of page
64, do not work as advertised.
The implementations that we used do not implement <tt>setw</tt>
properly for <tt>string</tt>s, as we noted in exercise 4-9 (page 74),
so we did not discover the problem during testing.
<p>
The most straightforward solution is to replace
</p><ul><tt>
cout &lt;&lt; setw(maxlen+1) &lt;&lt; students[i].name;
</tt></ul>
by
<ul><tt>
cout &lt;&lt; students[i].name &lt;&lt; string(maxlen+1 - students[i].name.size(), ' ');
</tt></ul>
thereby obviating exercise 4.9 entirely.
Alternatively, one could write
<ul><tt>cout &lt;&lt; setw(maxlen+1) &lt;&lt;
setiosflags(ios_base::left) &lt;&lt; students[i].name &lt;&lt;
resetiosflags(ios_base::left);
</tt></ul>
which would cause <tt>cout</tt> to left-justify (i.e. pad on the right)
while writing <tt>students[i].name</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 32: The definition of <tt>%</tt> in the table should say <tt>x - ((x / y) * y)</tt>
instead of <tt>x - ((x - y) * y)</tt>.  Ditto for the table on page 307.
</li><li>
Page 35: The using-directive for <tt>std::precision</tt> shouldn't be there.
</li><li>
Page 36: The program might divide by zero if the student enters no grades.
Discussing this eventuality in the main text would be a diversion, so we've added
a new exercise.
</li><li>
Page 46: The using-directive for <tt>std::precision</tt> shouldn't be there.
</li><li>
Page 47: The line near the middle of the page reading
<ol><tt>: median = homework[mid];</tt></ol>
should be
<ol><tt>: homework[mid];</tt></ol>
</li><li>
Page 54: The phrase ``reference to <tt>const</tt> <tt>double</tt>'' near the bottom of the page
should be ``reference to <tt>vector</tt> of <tt>const</tt> <tt>double</tt>.''
</li><li>
Page 60: In the program example, the subexpression <tt>grade(students[i])</tt>
should be <tt>grade(midterm,</tt> <tt>final,</tt> <tt>homework)</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 73: The description of the <tt>width</tt> member function should say that
the output is padded on the left, not on the right.
</li><li>
Page 80: In the first code example on the page, <tt>vector&lt;Student::info&gt;</tt>
should be <tt>vector&lt;Student_info&gt;</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 95: The comments in the program on this page have "left-hand"
and "right-hand" reversed.
</li><li>
Page 97: The definition
<tt>container&lt;T&gt;</tt> <tt>c();</tt>
should be
<tt>container&lt;T&gt;</tt> <tt>c;</tt>
</li><li>
Page 108: The test for <tt>i</tt> + <tt>sep.size()</tt> <tt>!=</tt> <tt>e</tt>
in the inner <tt>if</tt> is redundant,
as is the test <tt>if</tt> <tt>(i</tt> <tt>!=</tt> <tt>e)</tt> near the end of the program.
</li><li>
Page 115: In the last line of section 6.2.3, <tt>median_grade</tt> should be
<tt>grade_aux</tt>.
The <tt>average_analysis</tt> function does not take into account the possibility that
a student did no homework at all.
We're going to leave that possibility as an exercise.
</li><li>
Page 121: The description of <tt>accumulate</tt> is wrong.
The function copies <tt>t</tt>, adds each element in the range <tt>[b,</tt> <tt>e)</tt>
to the copy of <tt>t</tt>, and returns a copy of the modified copy of <tt>t</tt>
as its result.
</li>
<li>
Page 147: In the first paragraph in 8.2.4, it isn't really true that forward
iterators prevent us from looking at an element again.
What they do is to prevent us from moving an iterator to the
immediately preceding element.
</li>
<li>
Page 150: In the first sentence of section 8.3, the phrase "separate categories
from output iterators" should be "separate categories from forward iterators."
</li><li>
Page 163: In the last paragraph, the claim that users don't need to know
how <tt>Student_info</tt> is implemented isn't quite accurate:
They don't need to know in order to write code that uses it,
but they do need to know some of the details
in order to be able to prepare input files for the program.
</li><li>
Page 176: The <tt>month_lengths</tt> array should be defined as
<ul><tt>
const int month_lengths[] = { /* ... */ };
</tt></ul>
</li><li>
Page 178: The <tt>letters</tt> array should be defined as
<br>
<tt>
static const char* const letters[] = { /* ... */ };
</tt>
<br>
because there is no intent ever to change its elements.
</li><li>
Page 195: The call to <tt>split(words)</tt> in the last line of the
first code example should be <tt>split(line)</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 199: The name <tt>blanks</tt> should be <tt>spaces</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 200: The two references to <tt>words</tt> in the first complete
paragraph (the second of which is in a code example) should refer to <tt>line</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 220: In the last example on the page,
the variables <tt>temp</tt> and <tt>s</tt>
should be <tt>temp1</tt> and <tt>greeting</tt>, respectively.
</li><li>
Page 221: In the second paragraph of section 12.4, we should be talking about
<tt>Vec</tt>, not <tt>vector</tt>.
Moreover, in the hypothetical case, <tt>p</tt> would contain 42 empty rows,
not 42 rows of single null characters.
</li><li>
Page 249: Just before the last example, the phrase "version of <tt>final</tt> in <tt>Core</tt>"
should be "version of <tt>regrade</tt> in <tt>Core</tt>."
</li><li>
Page 250: Near the end of the third line, <tt>final</tt> should be <tt>regrade</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 264: In the first example, the last comment should say
"<em>changes only </em><tt>s2</tt><em> and not </em><tt>s1</tt>" instead of
"<em>changes only </em><tt>s1</tt><em> and not </em><tt>s2</tt>."
In the following example, the call <tt>make_unique();</tt> should be
<tt>cp.make_unique();</tt>
Page 281: in the last line before section 15.2.2, <tt>operator&gt;&gt;</tt> should be <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt>.
</li><li>
Page 282: In the last example, the last two parameters should be named
<tt>beg</tt> and <tt>end</tt>, respectively.
</li><li>
Page 287: In the discussion near the bottom of the page, <tt>protected</tt>
allows access to the base-class part of any object of the appropriate derived class,
not just the base-class part of the current object.
What it does not allow is access to members of freestanding base-class objects.
</li><li>
Page 292: Just before the sample output, the text describes the grade histogram as
containing asterisks, when it actually contains <tt>=</tt> symbols.
</li></ul>

<h2>Clarifications in the first printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Page 28: The description of the <tt>for</tt> statement should make it clear that
the <em>init-statement</em> is required to be either a definition or an
expression statement.
</li><li>
Page 191: In the first complete paragraph, the two uses of <tt>size_t</tt>
are easier to understand if they refer to <tt>size_type</tt> instead, to match the code.
The two names refer to the same type, so the uses are technically correct,
but it's easier to understand if they're changed.
</li><li>
Page 193: The discussion of the <tt>size</tt> function
at the bottom of the page makes it appear that the type
of the difference between two pointers is more important
than it really is.
The real point is that although the value of <tt>limit</tt> <tt>-</tt> <tt>data</tt>
has type <tt>ptrdiff_t</tt>, returning that value from <tt>size</tt>
converts it to <tt>size</tt>'s return type.
</li></ul>

<h2>Typographical details in the first printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
If a page has any <tt>constant-width</tt> text in the heading at the
top of the page (which can happen only for odd-numbered pages), the
page number is very slightly smaller than it should be.
The affected page numbers are 3, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 103, 105,
107, 109, 163, 179, 189, 191, 193, 215, 217, 219, 233, and 235.
</li>
<li>
Page xii: "language" should be "language" near the end of the third paragraph.
</li>
<li>
Page 24: Shortly before 2.4.1.2, change "such the ones" to "such as the ones."
</li><li>
Page 30: Change <tt>string::size_type</tt> to <tt>int</tt> in the two
<tt>for</tt> statements at the bottom of the page.
</li><li>
Page 34: The program in exercise 2-10 should have a
<tt>return 0;</tt> statement at the end.
</li><li>
Page 45: Near the bottom, change "it should easy" to "it should be easy."
</li><li>
Page 72: The comments in the last example on the page have their
beginning slashes in italic font rather than constant-width font.
</li><li>
Page 158: The word "have" appears twice in a row in the first paragraph
after the numbered list near the top of the page.
</li><li>
Page 162: The word "the" appears twice in a row in the first complete paragraph
on this page.
</li><li>
Page 164: The word "be" appears twice in a row in paragraph 5, line 3.
</li>
<li>
Page 167: In the second line of the paragraph beginning "<strong>Protection labels</strong>,"
"accessible" should be "accessible."
</li>
<li>
Page 178: In the second complete paragraph from the end of the page,
"determine the its type" should be "determine its type."
</li><li>
Page 199: Immediately before the example, "in of an expression" should be "in an expression."
In the last complete paragraph, the word "the" appears twice in a row.
</li><li>
Page 203: On the first line of the page, "such this one" should be "such as this one."
</li><li>
Page 224: Near the middle of the page, "does not to prevent" should be
"does not prevent."
</li><li>
Page 253: Near the end of the second paragraph, "use the a single" should be
"use a single."
</li><li>
Page 260: In the first line of the first complete paragraph,
"we would like be able" should be "we would like to be able."
</li><li>
Page 262: In the second paragraph from the end, ``such <tt>Student_info</tt>''
should be ``such as <tt>Student_info</tt>.''
</li><li>
Page 283: In the first complete paragraph, "an ordinary member functions"
should be "an ordinary member function."
</li><li>
Page 289: In the fourth line, "parameter, type" should be "parameter type."
</li><li>
Page 307: The table extends beyond the nominal right margin.
