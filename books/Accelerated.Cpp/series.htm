<h3>The C++ In-Depth Series</h3>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup, Editor</p>
<p><i>&quot;I have made this letter longer than usual, because I lack the time to make it short.
&quot; </i>—Blaise Pascal</p>
<p>The advent of the ISO/ANSI C++ standard marked the beginning of a 
new era for C++ programmers. The standard offers many new facilities 
and opportunities, but how can a real-world programmer find the time to 
discover the key nuggets of wisdom within this mass of information? The 
C++ In-Depth Series minimizes learning time and confusion by giving 
programmers concise, focused guides to specific topics.</p>
<p>Each book in this series presents a single topic, at a technical level 
appropriate to that topic. The Series' practical approach is designed to lift 
professionals to their next level of programming skills. Written by experts in 
the field, these short, in-depth monographs can be read and referenced 
without the distraction of unrelated material. The books are cross-referenced 
within the Series, and also reference <i>The </i>C++ <i>Programming Language </i>by 
Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>
<p>As you develop your skills in C++, it becomes increasingly important to 
separate essential information from hype and glitz, and to find the in-depth 
content you need in order to grow. The C++ In-Depth Series provides the 
tools, concepts, techniques, and new approaches to C++ that will give you a critical edge.</p>
