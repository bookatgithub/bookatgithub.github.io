 hacks.) If you'd like
new users to receive your customizations, simply replace
<I>/usr/share/skel/dot.cshrc</I> with your hacked
version of <I>.cshrc</I>. Don't forget
to rename the file as you copy it:</P>

<PRE># <B>cp /root/.cshrc /usr/share/skel/dot.cshrc</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Here, I overwrote the default <I>dot.cshrc</I> by
copying over the superuser's customized version of

<I>/usr/share/skel/dot.cshrc</I> directly, you may find
it more convenient to have a customized copy stored elsewhere.</P>

<P class="docText">All isn't lost if you already have existing users
whom you'd like to receive this file. First, find
out what users already exist and have home directories. This is a
quick way to do so:</P>

<PRE># <B>ls /usr/home</B>
dru    test</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Since this system has only two existing users, it's
an easy matter to copy over my customized
<I>.cshrc</I>. I'm also a lazy typist,
so I use <TT>~</TT> instead of typing out
<TT>/usr/home</TT>. Also note that I have to remember to
manually change ownership:</P>

<PRE># <B>cp /root/.cshrc ~dru/</B>

However, start your window manager <span class="docEmphasis">last</span>. Start
your other programs, one line at a time, putting an

<TT>fetchmail</TT>, why not start them off with a
customized configuration file that contains comments on how to add
their own customizations and URLs of where to go for further ideas? A
little homework and creativity on your part can help your users get
the most out of the utilities they use on a daily basis.</P>

files.</P>

<P class="docText">Similarly, <TT>FILES=2</TT> is another list of files. Those
two files had different permissions, which were defined by
<TT>MODE2</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Move down to the <TT>install</TT> section.
Don't worry so much about the syntax; rather, notice
the pattern. The first set of files are installed and their mode is
applied. Then the second set of files are installed with their mode.</P>

<P class="docText">It's an easy matter to customize this file to
reflect the dot files you'd like to see installed.
In this example, I only want to install my custom versions of
<I>dot.cshrc</I>, <I>dot.login</I>, and
<I>dot.xinitrc</I>. Since they all require the first
mode, I'll remove any references to the second set
of files:</P>

<PRE># <B>cd /usr/src/share/skel</B>
# <B>cp Makefile Makefile.orig</B>
# <B>vi Makefile</B>

#        @(#)Makefile        8.1 (Berkeley) 6/8/93
# my customized dot files to be installed into /usr/share/skel

FILES1= dot.cshrc dot.login dot.xinitrc
MODE1=        0644

NOOBJ=        noobj

all clean cleandir depend lint tags:

install:
        ${INSTALL} -o ${BINOWN} -g ${BINGRP} -m ${MODE1} ${FILES1} \
            ${DESTDIR}${BINDIR}/skel

.include &lt;bsd.prog.mk&gt;</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Now let's try a test run. I'll
replace the default dot files found in
<I>/usr/src/share/skel</I> with my customized versions.
I'll then remove the contents of
<I>/usr/share/skel</I> and see what happens when I run
my customized <I>Makefile</I>:</P>

<PRE># <B>cd /usr/src/share/skel</B>
# <B>rm dot.*</B>
# <B>cp ~/mystuff/dot.* .</B>

# <B>rm /usr/share/skel/*</B>
# <B>ls /usr/share/skel</B>

# <B>make install</B>
install -o root -g wheel -m 0644 dot.cshrc dot.login dot.xinitrc 
    /usr/share/skel
# <B>ls /usr/share/skel</B>
dot.cshrc    dot.login    dot.xinitrc</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">I find it very handy to keep a copy of my customized
<I>Makefile</I> and dot files in a separate directory,
in this case <I>~/mystuff</I>. This ensures they are
backed up. It's easy for me to grab those files
whenever I want to customize a particular system.</P>

<P class="docText">It's especially important to use a separate location
if you use <TT>cvsup</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1774"></A>
 to keep your system up-to-date.
Otherwise, your next update will notice your modified
<TT>src</TT> and happily replace those missing original
source files. But don't worry; it
won't touch your new
<I>/usr/share/skel</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">Of course, sometimes this is a very useful trick in itself. If you
ever mess up a file located somewhere within
<TT>/usr/src</TT>, a quick <TT>cvsup</TT> will
put everything back the way it was. See  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-5.html#bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-5"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #80]</span></A>  for details on <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1775"></A>
