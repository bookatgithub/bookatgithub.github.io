familiar tools available from the Unix shell prompt.
It's much easier to perform a task quickly when all
of the shortcuts your fingers have learned work on the first try.</P>

<P class="docText">Even something as simple as setting up your prompt the way you like
it can steal significant time from your productivity if you need to

significant time in a Unix shell, it's worth getting
organized. A bit of onetime effort will reward you later, every time
you sit down at the keyboard.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.11.2 Using unison</H4>

<P class="docText">Whenever I configure a new Unix host or get a shell on another
system, I install <TT>unison</TT>. Then, I create a
directory to receive the files I've stored in the
<I>/usr/work/sync</I> directory at
<span class="docEmphasis">host.example.com</span>. I call the local directory
<I>~/sync</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">To synchronize those two directories:</P>

<PRE>% <B>unison ~/sync ssh://username@host.example.com://usr/work/sync</B>

p = /home/david/sync; bn = sync

<P class="docText">After <TT>ssh</TT> prompts for a password or pass phrase,
the <TT>unison</TT> exchange begins. On a first-time
synchronization, <TT>unison</TT> will ask only one
question: whether you wish to copy the remote directory to the local
host.</P>

<PRE>Looking for changes
Warning: No archive files were found for these roots.  This can happen 
either because this is the first time you have synchronized these roots,

<P class="docText">Update detection may take a while on this run if the replicas are
large.</P>

<P class="docText"><TT>unison</TT> will assume that the last synchronized
state of both replicas was completely empty. This means that any
files that are different will be reported as conflicts, and any files
that exist only on one replica will be judged as new and propagated
to the other replica. If the two replicas are identical, then
<TT>unison</TT> will report no changes:</P>

good use of the
<I>sync</I> directory requires some discipline.
It's one thing to be able to copy files easily;
it's another thing to be able to use them without
modification on several hosts.</P>

<P class="docText">To take advantage of this hack, when you copy the dot files to your
home directory and notice that something doesn't
work exactly the way you like it to, make sure you
<span class="docEmphasis">don't simply change it for the local
host</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">Instead, update the dot files so that they use conditional if
statements, shell backticks (e.g., <TT>`hostname`</TT>), or
environment variables, to make them behave correctly on the new hosts
without breaking them on the systems where you already use them.
Then, copy the dot file back into your <I>~/sync</I>
directory and run the <TT>sy</TT> script.
<TT>unison</TT> will prompt for a password or passphrase
for the <TT>ssh</TT> connection, then ask you to verify
that you want to update your files back to the main server.</P>

<P class="docText">The first few times you do this, you may introduce breakage when the
new dot file is used on another host. With a bit of practice
you'll learn how to avoid that. The most important
trick is to test. Open a shell to the host and update the dot file,
and then open a second shell to the host without closing the first
one. If you broke anything that affects your ability to log in, you
can fix it with the first shell and test again.</P>

<P class="docText">There's no need to resynchronize every other host
you use for each file you change. I generally wait until
I'm logged onto a given host and need a newer
script, or need to make some additional changes to the local copy of
the dot file. Then I synchronize, make the changes in the sync
directory, test them locally, and resync them back to the main host.</P>

<P class="docText">Using this approach means that I don't have to
reinvent the wheel every time I want to perform a procedure
I've done before. Any process useful enough to be
done a couple of times becomes a script in my toolkit, and is
conveniently available anywhere I have a shell. With
<TT>unison</TT>, I don't have to keep
track of which files were modified on which end of the connection
since my last update.</P>

<P class="docText">Keep in mind that using a tool like <TT>unison</TT> can
provide a mechanism for someone to attempt to feed updates into your
central file repository. When you log into a host and run the update,
be conscious of whether <TT>unison</TT> asks for approval
to send back changes. If you don't remember making
those changes, you might be helping an attacker feed a Trojan horse
into your <I>.login</I>, which could end up giving the
attacker access to every system you use that script on.
<TT>unison</TT> will ask for confirmation for every file
change. Presumably, your central host is secure, but you need to be
particularly conscious when permitting file uploads.</P>
