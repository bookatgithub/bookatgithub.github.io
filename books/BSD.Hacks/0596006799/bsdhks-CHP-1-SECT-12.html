many
times have you either struggled with or tried to troubleshoot another
user through a thorny problem? Didn't you wish you
had another set of eyes behind you so you could simply type your
command set, point at the troublesome output, and say,
"That's the
problem." Well, if you can't bring
another user to your output, you can still share that real-time
output using an interactive shell.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.12.1 Recording All Shell Input and Output</H4>

<P class="docText">There <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1792"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1793"></A>
are actually several ways to
share what is happening on your screen. Let's start
by recording all of your input and output to a file. Then
we'll see how we can also allow another user to view
that output from another terminal.</P>

<P class="docText">Your BSD system comes with the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1794"></A>
<TT>script</TT> command which,
not surprisingly, allows you to script your session. This command is
extremely simple to use. Simply type <TT>script</TT>:</P>

<PRE>% <B>script</B>
Script started, output file is typescript</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">By default, <TT>script</TT> will create an output file
named <I>typescript</I> in your current directory. If
you prefer, you can specify a more descriptive name for your script
file:</P>

<PRE>% <B>script configure.firewall.nov.11.2003</B>
Script started, output file is configure.firewall.nov.11.2003</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Regardless of how you invoke the command, a new shell will be
created. This means that you will see the MOTD and possibly a
fortune, and your <I>.cshrc</I> will be reread.</P>

<P class="docText">You can now carry on as usual and all input and output will be
written to your script file. When you are finished, simply press
Ctrl-d. You will see this message:</P>

<PRE>Script done, output file is configure.firewall.nov.11.2003</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you've ended a script and decide later to append
some more work to a previous session, remember the
<TT>-a</TT> (append) switch:</P>

<PRE>% <B>script -a configure.firewall.nov.11.2003</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This will append your current scripting session to the named file.</P>

<P class="docText">I find <TT>script</TT> extremely useful, especially when
I'm learning how to configure something for the
first time. I can easily create a written record of which commands I
used, which commands were successful, and which commands caused which
error messages. It also comes in handy when I need to send an error
message to a mailing list or a program's maintainer.
I can simply copy or attach my script file into an email.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.12.2 Cleaning Up script Files</H4>

<P class="docText">The <TT>script</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1795"></A>
utility is a very quick and dirty
way to record a session, and it does have its limitations. One of its
biggest is that it records everything, including escape characters.
For example, here is the first line from one of my script files:</P>

<PRE>[1mdru@~ [m: cd /s  [K/ysr/  [K  [K  [K  [K  [Kusr/ports/security/sn o rt</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">It's a bit hard to tell, but this is what
<TT>script</TT> was recording:</P>

<PRE>cd /usr/ports/security/snort</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This isn't really
<TT>script</TT>'s fault;
it's ugly for several reasons. One, my customized
prompt contains control characters. Those display as
<TT>[1m</TT> and <TT>[m</TT> around my username.
Second, I had problems typing that day. Instead of
<TT>/usr</TT>, I typed <TT>/s</TT> and had to
backspace a character. Then I typed <TT>/ysr</TT> and had
to backspace three characters. Finally, I used tab completion. You
can see that I tried to tab at <TT>sn</TT> but received a
beep; I then tried to tab at <TT>sno</TT> and had my input
completed to <TT>snort</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Granted, if I had first used the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1796"></A>
<TT>file</TT> utility on my
script file, I would have received a warning about this behavior:</P>

<PRE>% <B>file configure.firewall.nov.11.2003</B>
configure.firewall.nov.11.2003: ASCII English text, with CRLF, CR, LF line
terminators, with escape sequences</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">All is not lost, though. This command will get rid of most of the
garbage characters:</P>

<PRE>% <B>more configure.firewall.nov.11.2003 | \</B>
  <B>col -b &gt; configure.firewall.nov.11.2003.clean</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText"><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1797"></A>
<TT>col</TT> is an interesting
little utility. It silently filters out what it
doesn't understand. Here's an
example where this actually works to our advantage.
<TT>col</TT> doesn't understand control
characters and escape sequences, which is exactly what we wish to get
rid of. Including <TT>-b</TT> also asks
<TT>col</TT> to remove backspaces.</P>

<P class="docText">The result is much more readable:</P>

<PRE>1mdlavigne6@~m: cd /usr/ports/security/snort

% <B>file configure.firewall.nov.11.2003.clean</B>
configure.firewall.nov.11.2003.clean: ASCII English text</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">I've found that using an editor during a script
session also produces very messy output into my script file. The
preceding <TT>col -b</TT> command will clean up most of the
mess, but I still won't have a very good idea of
exactly what I typed while I was in that editor. For this reason, I
use the <TT>echo</TT> command to send little comments to
myself:</P>

<PRE>% <B>echo # once you open up /etc/rc.conf</B>
% <B>echo # change this line: linux_enable="NO"</B>
% <B>echo # to this: linux_enable="YES"</B>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1798"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1799"></A>
recording a session. This time
I'll use the <TT>-i</TT> (or interactive)
switch of my shell:</P>

<PRE>% <B>csh -i | &amp; tee test_session.nov.12.2003</B></PRE><BR>

<P class="docText"><TT>tcsh</TT> is linked to <TT>csh</TT> in
FreeBSD. It doesn't matter which one I type;
I'll still end up with the <TT>tcsh</TT>
shell.</P>
</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></P><br>

<P class="docText">In that command, I used <TT>-i</TT> to start an interactive
<TT>tcsh</TT> shell. I then piped (<TT>|</TT>)
both stdout and stderr (<TT>&amp;</TT>) to the
<TT>tee</TT> command. If you've ever
looked at physical pipe plumbing, you'll recognize
the job of a "tee" in a pipe:
whatever is flowing will start going in both directions when it hits
the "tee." In my case, all stdout
and stderr generated by my shell will flow to both my monitor and to
the <I>test_session.nov.12.2003</I> file. When
I'm finished recording my session, I can type
Ctrl-c, Ctrl-d, or <TT>exit</TT> to quit.</P>

<P class="docText">Like the previous <TT>script</TT> command, an interactive
<TT>csh</TT> shell will present me with a new shell.
However, this method does not record escape characters, meaning I
won't need to use the <TT>col -b</TT>
command to clean up the resulting file.</P>

<P class="docText">But if I try to use <TT>vi</TT> during my session, the
shell will refuse to open the editor and will instead present me with
this interesting error message:</P>

<PRE>ex/vi: Vi's standard input and output must be a terminal.</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If I try to use <TT>ee</TT>, it will open, but none of the
commands will work. <TT>pico</TT> works nicely but still
throws garbage into the session file. So, if I need to use an editor
during my session, I'll still
<TT>echo</TT> some comments to myself so I can remember
what I did while I was in there.</P>

<P class="docText">Appending works almost exactly like it does for
<TT>script</TT>, again with the <TT>-a</TT>
(append) switch:</P>
