a graphical environment is
great. You can have numerous applications and utilities running, and
you can interact with all of them at the same time. Many people who
have grown up with a GUI environment look down upon those poor souls
who continue to work in a terminal console environment.
"After all," they say,
"you can only do one thing at a time and
don't get the same information and control that you
have in a desktop environment."</P>

<P class="docText">It's true; they do say those things. (I am curious
to know who <span class="docEmphasis">they</span> are, however.)</P>

<P class="docText">It's also true that the utility of a graphical
environment diminishes when you need to administer machines remotely.
Do you really want to squander network bandwidth just to maintain a
GUI session?</P>

<P class="docText">Here are some more questions to ask yourself regarding remote
administration:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Are you worried about making your services vulnerable just so you can
administer them across the Internet?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Do you want a secure connection?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Do you want to run multiple terminal sessions from a single login?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Do you want to be able to password protect your session to prevent
unauthorized access?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Do you want multiple windows with labels and of different sizes?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Do you want to copy and paste between the windows?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Are you prepared to lose a connection to your remote machine in the
middle of a critical operation?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Would you like to be able keep the session active even after
you've lost it or you've logged off
the remote server?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Do you want to take over a session that you launched from another
machine?</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Would you like to keep a hardcopy log of your sessions?</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">You are indeed a poor soul if you've reconciled
yourself to the standard <TT>ssh</TT> login without any
hope of resolving these questions. But all is not lost—the
solution is <TT>screen</TT>.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">1.13.3.1 Using windows with screen</H5>

<P class="docText">So far, this has no advantage over a normal SSH login. Yet suppose
you need to send some email while you're
downloading. Instead of putting the download into the background,
create another screen window with the key sequence <TT>C-a
c</TT>. This symbolizes that the Ctrl key is pressed with the
lowercase letter <TT>a</TT> and then, after releasing them,
you press a second key, in this case <TT>c</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">At this point the console will go blank. You'll be
presented with a second window. Use your favorite email client to
compose your message.</P>

<P class="docText">You'll <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1810"></A>
probably want to switch between the
download and mailer windows. Cycle forward in the window list with
<TT>C-a</TT> <TT>n</TT>. Cycle backward with
<TT>C-a p</TT>, although you'll likely see
no difference with two windows.</P>

<P class="docText">Being <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1811"></A>
the efficient person that you are,
you'd like to compile the source code as soon as it
has downloaded. Even though you haven't completed
your email, go back to the original window and extract the tarball:</P>

<PRE>% <B>tar -xzpvf  postgresql-7.4.tar.gz</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Wise administrators read the <I>INSTALL</I> file to
make sure all the correct options are invoked. It'd
be very handy to be able to read the instructions as you compose the
<TT>configure</TT> command in the same console.
<TT>screen</TT> comes to the rescue here, too: split the
window horizontally, running <TT>configure</TT> in the top
half and reading the documentation in the bottom half.</P>

<P class="docText">Type <TT>C-a S</TT> to split the screen, where the
<TT>S</TT> is uppercase. You should see a wide horizontal
bar in the middle of the screen. The top window will show whatever
existed when you split the window. You'll also see
the window's ID on the left side of the middle bar,
along with the name of the shell.</P>

<P class="docText">The bottom window doesn't yet have a shell running.
Set the focus to the other window with <TT>C-a Tab</TT>.
Create a new window with <TT>C-a c</TT>, as usual. Notice
that the window has the ID of <I>2</I> (shown in the
bottom lefthand corner); that's because the email
window that you created after starting the download has the ID of
<I>1</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">To list all windows associated with this session, use the command
<TT>C-a </TT>".</P>

<P class="docText">If cycling through windows is onerous, you can also switch between
windows by ID. For example, <TT>C-a ' 1</TT> will go to
window <I>1</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">Be prepared for a little confusion because the screen remains split
and now shows the window of your choice in the currently focused
window. You can quite easily show the same window in both the top and
bottom halves.</P>

<P class="docText">Enter window 0 with <TT>C-a ' 0</TT>, and extract the
tarball into its own directory. Enter window 2 with <TT>C-a '
2</TT>, and navigate to the uppermost directory of the source
code to read the <I>INSTALL</I> file.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">1.13.3.5 Naming windows</H5>

<P class="docText">ID numbers identify windows pretty well, but I prefer to use names of
my own choosing. Change a window's name with the
command <TT>C-a A</TT>. For example, <TT>C-a A
email</TT>, <TT>C-a A source</TT>, and <TT>C-a A
doc</TT> seem like a big improvement for the currently active
windows.</P>

<P class="docText">Now, listing the active windows with <TT>C-a </TT>" will
show the following:</P>

<PRE>NUM NAME
0   source
1   email
2   doc</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">At this point, you have one screen session with three windows. Your

<P class="docText">Suppose <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1812"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1813"></A>
you are called away from the
workstation in the middle of a sensitive operation (that is, you
haven't yet sent your email). Type <TT>C-a
x</TT> to protect your session. Depending on your configuration,
you will either input a password for the screen or use the default
account password.</P>

<P class="docText">Now suppose you don't return to your workstation.
What do you do? You can <TT>ssh</TT> into
<TT>bravo</TT> from a new location and attach to your
existing screen session with <TT>screen -dr A</TT>.
Remember, <TT>A</TT> was the name of the screen session.</P>

<P class="docText">After finishing and sending your email, kill off that screen. Type
the command <TT>C-a k</TT> in the <TT>email</TT>
window.</P>

<P class="docText">With that business finished, scroll back through the
<I>INSTALL</I> text file to find interesting
configuration switches. You <span class="docEmphasis">could</span> retype them,
but <TT>screen</TT> has a perfectly capable copy mode. Type
<TT>C-a ESC</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Use the cursor keys to navigate to the portions of the document you
want to copy. Hit the space bar to mark the beginning of the text to
copy. Scroll around to the end of the text with the cursor keys. The
current selection will display in reverse video. When
you're satisfied, hit the space bar to copy the
current selection into the buffer.</P>

<P class="docText">Switch to the <TT>source</TT> window and use <TT>C-a
]</TT> to paste the copied text.</P>

<P class="docText">You don't need the <TT>doc</TT> window
anymore, so switch into it and either <TT>exit</TT> the
shell or use the key sequence <TT>C-a k</TT> to kill it.
You could also merge the split screens together with the key sequence
<TT>C-a X</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Once you've started compiling, you can close the
terminal but leave the session active by detaching it; just type
<TT>C-a d</TT>. One of the nice features about detaching
the screen is that it is done automatically if you lose connection
with the server, so you won't lose your session. You
can reattach to the session later from the same location or from
another workstation altogether.</P>
