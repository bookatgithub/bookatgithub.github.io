of the first things
Unix users learn is that deleted files are really, really gone. This
is especially true at the command line where there
isn't any Windows-style recycling bin to rummage
through should you have a change of heart regarding the fate of a
removed file. It's off to the backups! (You do have
backups, don't you?)</P>

<P class="docText">Fortunately, it is very simple to hack a small script that will send
removed files to a custom trash directory. If you've
never written a script before, this is an excellent exercise in how
easy and useful scripting can be.</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-9.1"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.9.1 Shell Scripting for the Impatient</H4>

<P class="docText">Since a script is an executable file, you should place your scripts
in a directory that is in your path. Remember, your path is just a
list of directories where the shell will look for commands if you
don't give them full pathnames. To see your path:</P>

<PRE>% <B>echo $PATH</B>
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/
local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/dru/bin</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">In this output, the shell will look for executables in the
<I>bin</I> subdirectory of
<TT>dru</TT>'s home directory. However, it
won't look for executables placed directly in my
home directory, or <I>/home/dru</I>. Since
<I>bin</I> isn't created by default, I
should do that first:</P>

<PRE>% <B>cd</B>
% <B>mkdir bin</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">As I create scripts, I'll store them in
<I>/home/dru/bin</I>, since I don't
have permission to store them anywhere else. Fortunately, no one else
has permission to store them in my <I>bin</I>
directory, so it's a good match.</P>

<P class="docText">The scripts themselves contain at least three lines:</P>

<PRE>#!/bin/sh
# a comment explaining what the script does
the command to be executed</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The first line indicates the type of script by specifying the program
to use to execute the script. I've chosen to use a
Bourne script because that shell is available on all Unix systems.</P>

<P class="docText">Your script should also have comments, which start with the
<TT>#</TT> character. It's surprising how
forgetful you can be six months down the road, especially if you
create a lot of scripts. For this reason, you should also give the
script a name that reminds you of what it does.</P>

<P class="docText">The third and subsequent lines contain the meat of the script: the
actual command(s) to execute. This can range from a simple one-liner
to a more complex set of commands, variables, and conditions.
Fortunately, we can make a trash script in a simple one-liner.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-9.2"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.9.2 The Code</H4>

<P class="docText">Let's start with this variant, which I found as the
result of a Google search:</P>

<PRE>% <B>more ~/bin/trash</B>
#!/bin/sh
# script to send removed files to trash directory
mv $1 ~/.trash/</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">You should recognize the path to the Bourne shell, the comment, and
the <TT>mv</TT> command. Let's take a look
at that <TT>$1</TT>. This is known as a
<I>positional parameter</I> and specifically refers
to the first parameter of the <TT>trash</TT> command. Since
the <TT>mv</TT> commands takes filenames as parameters, the
command:</P>

<PRE>mv $1 ~/.trash/</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">is really saying, <TT>mv</TT> the first filename, whatever
it happens to be, to a directory called <I>.trash</I>
in the user's home directory (represented by the
shell shortcut of <TT>~</TT>). This move operation is our
custom "recycle."</P>

<P class="docText">Before this script can do anything, it must be set as executable:</P>

<PRE>% <B>chmod +x ~/bin/trash</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">And I must create that trash directory for it to use:</P>

<PRE>% <B>mkdir ~/.trash</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that I've chosen to create a hidden trash
directory; any file or directory that begins with the
. character is hidden from normal listings. This
really only reduces clutter, though, as you can see these files by
passing the <TT>-a</TT> switch to <TT>ls</TT>. If
you also include the <TT>F</TT> switch, directory names
will end with a <I>/</I>:</P>

<PRE>% <B>ls -aF ~</B>
.cshrc    .history    .trash/
bin/      images/     myfile</PRE><BR>



<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-9.3"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.9.3 Replacing rm with ~/bin/trash</H4>

<P class="docText">Now comes the neat part of the hack. I want this script to kick in
every time I use <TT>rm</TT>. Since it is the shell that
executes commands, I simply need to make my shell use the
<TT>trash</TT> command instead. I do that by adding this
line to <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1743"></A>
<I>~/.cshrc</I>:</P>

<PRE>alias rm        trash</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">That line basically says: when I type <TT>rm</TT>, execute
<TT>trash</TT> instead. It doesn't matter
which directory I am in. As long as I stay in my shell, it will
<TT>mv</TT> any files I try to <TT>rm</TT> to my
hidden trash directory.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-9.4"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.9.4 Running the Code Safely</H4>

<P class="docText">Whenever you create a script, always test it first.
I'll start by telling my shell to reread its
configuration file:</P>

<PRE>% <B>source ~/.cshrc</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Then, I'll make some test files to remove:</P>

<PRE>% <B>cd</B>
% <B>mkdir test</B>
% <B>cd test</B>
% <B>touch test1</B>
% <B>rm test1</B>

% <B>ls ~/.trash</B>
test1</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Looks like the script is working. However, it has a flaw. Have you
spotted it yet? If not, try this:</P>

<PRE>% <B>touch a aa aaa aaaa</B>
% <B>rm a*</B>

% <B>ls ~/.trash</B>
test1         a

% <B>ls test</B>
aa         aaa         aaaa</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">What happened here? I passed the shell more than one parameter. The
<TT>a*</TT> was expanded to <TT>a</TT>,
<TT>aa</TT>, <TT>aaa</TT>, and
<TT>aaaa</TT> <span class="docEmphasis">before</span>
<TT>trash</TT> could execute. Those four parameters were
then passed on to the <TT>mv</TT> command in my script.
However, <TT>trash</TT> passes only the first parameter to
the <TT>mv</TT> command, ignoring the remaining parameters.
Fortunately, they weren't removed, but the script
still didn't achieve what I wanted.</P>

<P class="docText">You can actually have up to nine parameters, named
<TT>$1</TT> to <TT>$9</TT>. However, our goal is
to catch all parameters, regardless of the amount. To do that, we use
<TT>$@</TT>:</P>

<PRE>mv $@ ~/.trash/</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Make that change to your script, then test it by removing multiple
files. You should now have a script that works every time.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-9.5"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.9.5 Taking Out the Trash</H4>

<P class="docText">You should occasionally go through your trash directory and really
remove the files you no longer want. If you're
really on your toes you may be thinking, "But how do
I empty the trash directory?" If you do this:</P>

<PRE>% <B>rm ~/.trash/*</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">your trash directory won't lose any files! This time
you really do want to use <TT>rm</TT>, not
<TT>trash</TT>. To tell your shell to use the real
<TT>rm</TT> command, simply put a <TT>\</TT> in
front of it like so:</P>

<PRE>% <B>\rm /trash/*</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Voila, empty recycling bin.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-9.6"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.9.6 Hacking the Hack</H4>

<P class="docText">One obvious extension is to keep versioned backups. Use the
<TT>date</TT> command to find the time of deletion and
append that to the name of the file in the <TT>trash</TT>
command. You could get infinitely more complicated by storing a
limited number of versions or deleting all versions older than a week
or a month. Of course, you could also keep your important files under
version control and leave the complexity to someone <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-1-ITERM-1744"></A>
