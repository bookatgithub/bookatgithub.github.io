<P class="docText">Someday <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1993"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1994"></A>
the unthinkable may
happen. You're doing some routine maintenance and
are distracted by a phone call or perhaps another
employee's question. A moment later,
you're faced with the awful realization that your
fingers typed either <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1995"></A>
a <TT>rm *</TT> or a
<TT>rm -R</TT> in the wrong place, and now a portion of
your system has evaporated into nothingness.</P>

<P class="docText">Painful thought, isn't it? Let's
pause for a moment to catch our breath and examine a few ways to
prevent such a scenario from happening in the first place.</P>

<P class="docText">Close your eyes and think back to when you were a fresh-faced newbie
and were introduced to the omnipotent <TT>rm</TT> command.
Return to the time when you actually read <TT>man rm</TT>
and first discovered the <TT>-i</TT> switch.
"What a great idea," you thought,
"to be prompted for confirmation before
irretrievably deleting a file from disk." However,
you soon discovered that this switch can be a royal PITA. Face it,
it's irritating to deal with the constant question
of whether you're sure you want to remove a file
when you just issued the command to remove that file.</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-SECT-11.1"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.11.1 Necessary Interaction</H4>

<P class="docText">Fortunately, there is a way to request confirmation only when
you're about to do something as rash as <TT>rm
*</TT>. Simply make a file called <I>-i</I>. Well,
actually, it's not quite that simple. Your shell
will complain if you try this:</P>

<PRE>% <B>touch -i</B>
touch: illegal option -- i
usage: touch [-acfhm] [-r file] [-t [[CC]Y]MMDDhhmm[.SS]] file ...</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">You <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1996"></A>
see, to
your shell, <I>-i</I> looks like the
<TT>-i</TT> switch, which <TT>touch</TT>
doesn't have. That's actually part
of the magic. The reason why we want to make a file called
<I>-i</I> in the first place is to fool your shell:
when you type <TT>rm *</TT>, the shell will expand
<TT>*</TT> into all of the files in the directory. One of
those files will be named <I>-i</I>, and, voila,
you've just given the interactive switch to
<TT>rm</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">So, how do we get past the shell to make this file? Use this command
instead:</P>

<PRE>% <B>touch ./-i</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <TT>./</TT> acts as a sort of separator instruction to
the shell. To the left of the <TT>./</TT> go any options to
the command <TT>touch</TT>; in this case, there are none.
To the right of the <TT>./</TT> is the name of the file to
<TT>touch</TT> in "this
directory."</P>

<P class="docText">In order for this to be effective, you need to create a file called
<I>-i</I> in every directory that you would like to
protect from an inadvertent <TT>rm *</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">An alternative method is to take advantage of the
<TT>rmstar</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1997"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1998"></A>
 shell variable found in the
<TT>tcsh</TT> shell. This method will always prompt for
confirmation of a <TT>rm *</TT>, regardless of your current
directory, as long as you always use <TT>tcsh</TT>. Since
the default shell for the superuser is <TT>tcsh</TT>, add
this line to <I>/root/.cshrc</I>:</P>

<P class="docText">Now <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1999"></A>
you know how to protect yourself from
<TT>rm *</TT>. Unfortunately, neither method will save you
from <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-2000"></A>
a <TT>rm -R</TT>. If you do
manage to blow away a portion of your directory structure, how do you
fix the mess with a minimum of fuss, fanfare, and years of teasing
from your coworkers? Sure, you can always restore from backup, but
that means filling in a form in triplicate, carrying it with you as
you walk to the other side of the building where backups are stored,
and sheepishly handing it over to the clerk in charge of tape
storage.</P>

<P class="docText">Fortunately for a hacker, there is always more than one way to skin a
cat, or in this case, to save your skin. That directory structure had
to be created in the first place, which means it can be recreated.</P>

<P class="docText">When you installed FreeBSD, it created a directory structure for you.
The utility responsible for this feat is called
<TT>mtree</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">To see which directory structures were created with
<TT>mtree</TT>:</P>

<PRE>% <B>ls /etc/mtree/</B>
./                    BSD.root.dist           BSD.x11-4.dist
../                   BSD.sendmail.dist       BSD.x11.dist
BSD.include.dist      BSD.usr.dist
BSD.local.dist        BSD.var.dist</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Each of these files is in ASCII text, meaning you can read, and more
interestingly, edit their contents. If you're a
hacker, I know what you're thinking. Yes, you can
edit a file to remove the directories you don't want
and to add other directories that you do.</P>

<P class="docText">Let's start with a simpler example. Say
you've managed to blow away
<I>/var</I>. To recreate it:</P>

<P class="docText">That looks a lot better, but don't breathe that sigh
of relief quite yet. You still have to recreate all of your log
files. Yes, <I>/var/log</I> is still glaringly empty.
Remember, <TT>mtree</TT> creates a directory structure, not
all of the files within that directory structure. If you have a
directory structure containing thousands of files,
you're better off grabbing your backup tape.</P>

<P class="docText">There is hope for <I>/var/log</I>, though. Rather than
racking your brain for the names of all of the missing log files, do
this instead:</P>
