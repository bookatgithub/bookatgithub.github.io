<P class="docText">If <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1907"></A>
you're
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1908"></A>
like many Unix
users, you originally came from a Windows background. Remember your
initial shock the first time you tried to use a floppy on a Unix
system? Didn't Windows seem so much simpler? Forever
gone seemed the days when you could simply insert a floppy, copy some
files over, and remove the disk from the drive. Instead, you were
expected to plunge into the intricacies of the
<TT>mount</TT> command, only to discover that you
didn't even have the right to use the floppy drive
in the first place!</P>

<P class="docText">There are several ways to make using floppies much, much easier on
your FreeBSD system. Let's start by taking stock of
the default mechanisms for managing floppies.</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-SECT-7.1"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.7.1 Mounting a Floppy</H4>

<P class="docText">Suppose
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1909"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1910"></A>
I
have formatted a floppy on a Windows system, copied some files over,
and now want to transfer those files to my FreeBSD system. In
reality, that floppy is a storage media. Since it is storing files,
it needs a <span class="docEmphasis">filesystem</span> in order to keep track of
the locations of those files. Because that floppy was formatted on a
Windows system, it uses a filesystem called FAT12.</P>

<P class="docText">In Unix, a filesystem can't be accessed until it has
been <span class="docEmphasis">mounted</span>. This means you have to use the
<TT>mount</TT> command before you can access the contents
of that floppy. While this may seem strange at first, it actually
gives Unix more flexibility. An administrator can mount and unmount
filesystems as they are needed. Note that I used the word
<span class="docEmphasis">administrator</span>. Regular users
don't have this ability, by default.
We'll change that shortly.</P>

<P class="docText">Unix also has the additional flexibility of being able to
<TT>mount</TT> different filesystems. In Windows, a floppy
will always contain the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1911"></A>
FAT12 filesystem. BSD understands
floppies formatted with either FAT12 or <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1912"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1913"></A>
UFS, the Unix File System. As you
might expect from the name, the UFS filesystem is assumed unless you
specify otherwise.</P>

<P class="docText">For now, become the superuser and let's pick apart
the default invocation of the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1914"></A>
<TT>mount</TT> command:</P>

<PRE>% <B>su</B>
Password:
# <B>mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt</B>

<P class="docText">I used the type (<TT>-t</TT>) switch to indicate that this
floppy was formatted from an <TT>msdos</TT>-based system. I
could have used the
<TT>mount_msdosfs</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1915"></A>
 command instead:</P>

<PRE># <B>mount_msdosfs /dev/fd0 /mnt</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Both commands take two arguments. The first indicates the device to
be mounted. <TT>/dev/fd0</TT> represents the first
(<TT>0</TT>) floppy drive (<TT>fd</TT>) device
(<TT>/dev</TT>).</P>

<P class="docText">The second argument represents the <span class="docEmphasis">mount point</span>.
A <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-2-ITERM-1916"></A>
mount point
is simply an empty directory that acts as a pointer to the mounted
filesystem. Your FreeBSD system comes with a default mount point
called <I>/mnt</I>. If you prefer, create a different
mount point with a more useful name. Just remember to keep that
directory empty so it will be available as a mount point, because any
files in your mount point will become hidden and inaccessible when
you mount a device over it.</P>

before I became proficient at this whole <TT>mount</TT>

could figure out what I had done wrong and how to fix it.</P>

<P class="docText">Remember my first <TT>mount</TT> command? I know it worked,

didn't work, because <TT>mount</TT>
instead wrote me a message explaining why it did
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> do what I asked.</P>

<P class="docText">That error message isn't actually as bad as it
sounds. I forgot to include the type switch, meaning
<TT>mount</TT> assumed I was using UFS. Since this is a
FAT12 floppy, it simply didn't understand the
filesystem.</P>

<P class="docText">This error message also looks particularly nasty:</P>

<PRE>fd0: hard error cmd=read fsbn 0 of 0-3 (No status)
msdosfs: /dev/fd0: Input/output error</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you get that one, quickly reach down and push in the floppy before
anyone else notices. You forgot to insert it into the bay.</P>

<P class="docText">Here's another error message:</P>

<PRE>msdosfs: /dev/fd0: Operation not permitted</PRE><BR>

<P class="docText">Looks like I forgot to make that mount point first. A <TT>mkdir

<P class="docText">The one error message you do not want to see is a system panic
followed by a reboot. It took me a while to break myself of the habit
of just ejecting a floppy once I had copied over the files I wanted.
That's something you just don't do
in Unix land.</P>

<P class="docText">You must first warn your operating system that you have finished
using a filesystem before you physically remove it from the computer.
Otherwise, when it goes out looking for a file, it will panic when it
realizes that it has just disappeared off of the edge of the
universe! (Well, the computer's universe anyway.)
Put yourself in your operating system's shoes for a
minute. The user entrusted something important to your care. You
blinked for just a split second and it was gone, nowhere to be found.
You'd panic too!</P>
