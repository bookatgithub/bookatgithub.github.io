this
chapter, we've covered many methods of securing the
boot and login environments. It's probably no
surprise that you can further control who can log into your system
and when: Unix systems contain many built-in mechanisms, allowing you
to choose the most appropriate means and policy for your network.</P>

<P class="docText">Furthermore, the defaults may not always suit your needs. Do you
really want users to be logged into multiple terminals when they can
effectively do their work from one? For that matter, do you want any
user, including nonemployees, to try his hand at logging into your
systems at any hour of the night and day? Here's how
to tighten up some defaults.</P>

<I>/etc/ttys</I>. We

<P class="docText">This file is divided into three sections, one for each of the three
types of terminals. Let's concern ourselves with the
virtual terminals, <TT>ttyv</TT>, which are the terminals

<P class="docText">The word <TT>on</TT> indicates that that terminal is
available for logins. By default, the first eight terminals,
<TT>ttyv0</TT> through <TT>ttyv7</TT>, will
accept logins. You've probably discovered this
yourself by pressing Alt-F<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>, where
<span class="docEmphasis">x</span> is a number between 1 and 8. On a server
system, you may need only one virtual terminal. Disable the other
terminals by changing the word <TT>on</TT> to
<TT>off</TT>.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.12.2 /etc/login.access</H4>

<P class="docText">Now <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2182"></A>
let's see what can be done
with <I>/etc/login.access</I>. At its most stringent,
you can use this file to prevent all <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2183"></A>
remote
logins, meaning you can log in only if you are physically sitting at
that system:</P>

<PRE>-:ALL:ALL EXCEPT LOCAL</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note the syntax that is used for each line in this file. The
<TT>-</TT> means access denied. Its alter ego is
<TT>+</TT>, which means access granted. The first
<TT>ALL</TT> is a wildcard for all users. The second
<TT>ALL</TT> is a wildcard for all locations. The
<TT>EXCEPT</TT> <TT>LOCAL</TT> is the exception
that allows just the local location.</P>

<P class="docText">You could modify that rule slightly to disallow remote and local root
logins:</P>

<PRE>-:root:ALL</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Take some care when modifying this file. Its syntax supports both
user and group names, allowing you to specify exactly who is allowed
to log into a system. This can be extremely useful in limiting access
to a server system.</P>

<P class="docText">The syntax also supports IP addresses. This can also be useful in
ensuring that only hosts in your network or a particular subnet can
access certain systems. But, as in any security mechanism that relies
on IP addresses, do keep in mind that IP addresses can be spoofed.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, if you make changes to this file, <span class="docEmphasis">test your
changes immediately</span>. If you restrict access to certain
users, ensure those users can still log in. Further, try to log in as
other users to ensure that they are actually being denied access.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-12.3"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.12.3 /etc/ssh/sshd_config</H4>

<P class="docText">Think <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2184"></A>
for
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2185"></A>
a moment. Other than logins to virtual
terminals, how else do your users log into systems? Most likely (and,
hopefully) through <TT>ssh</TT>. You can control exactly
who can <TT>ssh</TT> into a system by adding a line to the
<I>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</I> file of the system running
the SSH daemon.</P>

<P class="docText">There are two ways you can control this. One is through
<TT>AllowGroups</TT>. By default, all groups—meaning
all users—can <TT>ssh</TT> into a system. The other
way is through <TT>AllowUsers</TT>, where again, all users
are allowed by default.</P>

<P class="docText">Suppose I want to allow only the users <TT>genisis</TT>,
<TT>biko</TT>, and <TT>dru</TT> to
<TT>ssh</TT> into a particular system. I could create a
group called <TT>remote</TT> that contains those users:</P>

<PRE># <B>grep 100 /etc/group</B>
#
# <B>pw groupadd remote -g 100 -M genisis biko dru</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">In this example, I first double-checked that the group ID of 100 was
not currently in use. I then created, with <TT>pw
groupadd</TT>, the <TT>remote</TT> group with a GID of
100 (<TT>-g 100</TT>) and with those three members
(<TT>-M genisis biko dru</TT>).</P>

<P class="docText">Now I can limit <TT>ssh</TT> access to just the members of
that group:</P>

<PRE># <B>echo 'AllowGroups remote' &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Alternatively, I could have just added those three users directly:</P>

<PRE># <B>echo 'AllowUsers genisis biko dru' &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Any user who does not match either <TT>AllowGroups</TT> or
<TT>AllowUsers</TT> will still receive a password prompt
when attempting to connect to the SSH daemon. However, the connection
attempt will fail with a <TT>permission denied</TT>
message, even if the user provides a correct username and password.
The SSH daemon will print a message regarding the failed attempt to
its console, sending a copy to <I>/var/log/messages</I>
and emailing to <TT>root</TT> as part of the daily security
run output.</P>

<P class="docText">To be even pickier, <span class="docEmphasis">if your users always log in from the
same system</span>, you can do this:</P>

<PRE>AllowUsers genisis@10.0.0.2 biko@10.0.0.3 dru@10.0.0.4</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">However, don't be that picky if your users
don't have static IPs!</P>

<P class="docText">Remember, if you make any changes to the SSH
daemon's configuration file, you'll
need to send a "signal one" to
<TT>sshd</TT> to notify it of the changes:</P>

<PRE># <B>killall -1 sshd</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">After informing <TT>sshd</TT> of the changes,
<span class="docEmphasis">immediately</span> use a <TT>ssh</TT> client
to test your changes. For example, if I instead add the line
<TT>Allowusers genisis biko</TT> <TT>dru</TT>,
I'll find that user <TT>nastygirl</TT> is
still able to connect. Why? The parameters in
<I>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</I> are
<span class="docEmphasis">case-sensitive</span>. You don't want
to find out six months later that anyone was allowed to connect when
you thought you had restricted connections to certain users.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-12.4"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.12.4 /etc/login.conf</H4>

<P class="docText">We've <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2186"></A>
restricted who can
log in and from where for both local and remote
<TT>ssh</TT> logins, but we still haven't
restricted <span class="docEmphasis">when</span> those users can log in. To do
that, let's look at some other options that are
available in our old friend /etc/login.conf  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-8.html#bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-8"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #30]</span></A> .</P>

<TT>times.allow</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2187"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2188"></A>
 and <TT>times.deny</TT>. For
example, to allow all users to log in between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM
every Monday through Friday, add this line to the
<TT>default:\</TT> section:</P>

<PRE>:times.allow=Mo-Fr0900-1700:\</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Once you introduce the <TT>times.allow</TT> option, access
will automatically be denied for the time period
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> listed.</P>

<P class="docText">The converse also works. That is, you can specify the denied times in
<TT>times.deny</TT>, and all other times will be allowed.</P>

<P class="docText">Remember, whenever you make a change to
<I>/etc/login.conf</I>, rebuild the database with
<TT>cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf</TT> and test <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2189"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2190"></A>
