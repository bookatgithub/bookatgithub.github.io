You're 
not quite sure what you did to give
the impression that you don't already have enough to
do. Somehow, though, you were elected at the latest staff meeting to
create a jazzy logo that will appear on every user's
computer when they boot up in the morning.</P>

<P class="docText">While you may not be able to tell from first glance, the FreeBSD boot
menu supports a surprising amount of customization.
Let's start by examining your current menu to see
which tools you have to work with.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.2.1 The Default Boot Menu</H4>

<P class="docText">Your default boot menu will vary slightly depending upon your version
of FreeBSD and whether you chose to install the boot menu when you
installed the system. Let's start with the most
vanilla boot prompt and work our way up from there. In this scenario,
you'll see this message as your system boots:</P>

<PRE>Hit [Enter] to boot immediately, or any other key for command prompt.
Booting [/boot/kernel/kernel] in 10 seconds...</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">FreeBSD 5.1 introduced a quasi-graphical boot menu that includes a
picture of <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2028"></A>
Beastie and the following options:</P>

<PRE>Welcome to FreeBSD!

  1. Boot FreeBSD [default]
  2. Boot FreeBSD with ACPI disabled
  3. Boot FreeBSD in Safe Mode
  4. Boot FreeBSD in single user mode
  5. Boot FreeBSD with verbose logging
  6. Escape to loader prompt
  7. Reboot

          Select option, [Enter] for default
          or [Space] to pause timer  10</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">It is possible to get this menu without doing a full install of
FreeBSD 5.1. If you're like me and use cvsup  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-5.html#bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-5"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #80]</span></A>  and
<TT>buildworld</TT> to keep up-to-date, you already have
the necessary files but need to do a bit of editing to enable this
boot menu. Even if you already have the boot menu, follow along
because we're about to discover some of the logic
behind the FreeBSD boot process. This will be excellent preparation
for learning how to hack in your own customizations.</P>

<P class="docText">Let's start by taking a look at the
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2029"></A>

boot information. Not surprisingly, it's called
<I>/boot</I>:</P>

<P class="docText">The actual file containing the new menu is
<I>beastie.4th</I>. If your sources are out-of-date and
you don't have this file, you can download it from

the other

mentioned, <I>loader.conf</I>? Well, you should
actually have two files with that name.
<I>/boot/defaults/loader.conf</I> is the system
default, and you should never edit <span class="docEmphasis">this</span> file.
Instead, copy it over to <I>/boot/loader.conf</I> and
make your changes there. That way, not only do you have a chance to
see what is available for customization, you also reduce your risk of
typos. Each line in this file is commented and additional information
can be gleaned from <TT>man loader.conf</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Locate the <TT>Splash screen configuration</TT> section so
you can configure that company logo your boss keeps insisting on.
This is what it looks like by default:</P>

<PRE>splash_bmp_load="NO"          # Set this to YES for bmp splash screen!
splash_pcx_load="NO"          # Set this to YES for pcx splash screen!

bitmap_load="NO"              # Set this to YES if you want splash screen!
bitmap_name="splash.bmp"      # Set this to the name of the bmp or pcx file
bitmap_type="splash_image_data" # and place it on the module_path</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Obviously, we'll have to change the
<TT>NO</TT> in one of those <TT>splash</TT> lines
to a <TT>YES</TT>. Which one depends upon your picture
format. The two types of images that can be loaded are
<TT>bmp</TT> or <TT>pcx</TT>. Depending upon the
image you have to work with, change the appropriate
<TT>NO</TT> to a <TT>YES</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">If the image also happens to have eight or more bits of color, set
<TT>vesa_load</TT> to <TT>YES</TT>. If you have
no idea what type or size of picture you're dealing
with, use the <TT>file</TT> command:</P>

<PRE># <B>file logo.bmp</B>
logo.bmp:  PC bitmap data, Windows 3.x format, 408 x 167 x 8</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This particular logo is a <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2040"></A>
bitmap that is 408 167 pixels at 8 bits
of color.</P>

<P class="docText">Don't forget to set the path of your bitmap file,
and make sure you remember to copy that bitmap to the specified

<P class="docText">When you're editing
<I>/boot/loader.conf</I>, keep in mind that you are
asking the loader program to load various portions of the kernel. If
you have changed your kernel configuration file  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-2.html#bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-2"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #54]</span></A>, double-check that you
haven't stripped your kernel of a function
you're now asking <TT>loader</TT> to load.
For example, before rebooting I should double-check that
<TT>splash</TT> functionality is still in my kernel. Here,
my new kernel configuration file is named <I>NEW</I>:</P>

<PRE># <B>grep splash /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/NEW</B>
device        splash        # Splash screen and screen saver support</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText"><TT>splash</TT> also requires <TT>device sc</TT>,
so ensure that is your console type:</P>

<PRE># <B>grep -w sc /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/NEW</B>
device    sc</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <TT>-w</TT> flag tells <TT>grep</TT> to treat
<TT>sc</TT> as a word rather than attempt to match any word
containing the letters <TT>sc</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Once you're happy with your changes, make sure no
one is working on the system and then <TT>reboot</TT>. Your
bitmap image should appear right after you make your choice at the
Beastie menu. It will remain on the screen until you press a key.
This behavior has the advantage of displaying your company logo
instead of the usual startup messages. However, if you ever need to
see those messages, simply press a key and your bitmap will
disappear.</P>
