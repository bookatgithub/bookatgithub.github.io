boot environment for users is one thing.
However, when it comes to booting up servers, your mind automatically
shifts gears to security mode. Your goal is to ensure that only a
very precious few on very rare occasions ever see the boot process on
a server. After all, the golden rule in security land is
"physical access equals complete
access."</P>

<P class="docText">Here's a prime example—consider recovering
from an unknown or forgotten root password. Go into the server
closet, reboot that system, and press a key to interrupt the boot
process to change the password. A few moments later, the system
continues to boot as normal. This can be a real lifesaver if an admin
leaves without divulging the root password. However, consider the
security implications of an unauthorized user gaining physical access
to that server: instant root access!</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2048"></A>
by ensuring that regular users
can't reboot the system either inadvertently or
maliciously. By default, if a user presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, the
system will clean up and reboot. Typically this
isn't an issue for servers, as most administration
is done remotely and the server is safely locked away in a server
closet. However, it can wreak havoc on workstations, especially if
the user is used to working in a Windows environment and has become
accustomed to pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete. It's also
worthwhile disabling on a server, as it ensures that a person has to
first become the superuser in order to issue the
<TT>reboot</TT> command.</P>

<P class="docText">Disabling this feature requires a kernel rebuild. (See  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-2.html#bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-2"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #54]</span></A>  for detailed instructions.)
Add one of these lines to your kernel configuration file, then
rebuild and reinstall the kernel:</P>

<PRE>options SC_DISABLE_REBOOT  # if using syscons console driver

# or

options PCVT_CTRL_ALT_DEL  # if using pcvt console driver</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">You're probably thinking, "If I
wanted to reboot a system and didn't know the
superuser password, I'd simply hit the power
button." Yup! That kernel option certainly
won't prevent that, but a carefully thought out
CMOS<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#bsdhks-CHP-3-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> configuration will decide if and how that system will
reboot.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> CMOS is battery-powered memory that holds system
settings such as the time, date, and system configuration.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">At a minimum, the CMOS configuration should allow only one boot
device. This is to prevent an intruder from trying to boot an
alternate kernel from a floppy, CD-ROM drive, or other supported boot
device. Additionally, you should set a password for CMOS and record
it in a safe place. This will prevent an intruder from simply
changing the CMOS configuration. Keep in mind that this is not
fail-proof; you are merely adding layers of inconvenience. A
determined intruder can simply pop open the case and drain the CMOS
battery, but that takes time and additional effort.</P>

the magic happens when you
interrupt the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2051"></A>
boot
process. This is where you can change the superuser password without
having to first know the superuser password. This is where you can
unload the currently loaded kernel and replace it with another. This
is where you can change any configuration file or binary without
worrying about securelevels or system flags  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-4.html#bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-4"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #56]</span></A> . This is the reason why you
lock up your servers, monitor access to the server room, and run them
headless  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-4.html#bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-4"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #26]</span></A> .</P>

<P class="docText">Fortunately, interrupting the boot process requires keyboard input,
meaning the user needs physical access to the system. What happens
when a malicious user does bypass your physical security measures,
gaining physical access to the system? All she has to do is interrupt
that boot process, and the system is hers to do as she wishes.</P>

<P class="docText">On a system without the graphical boot menu  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-2.html#bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-2"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #24]</span></A>, pressing any key at the
timer will pause the boot process. If the system has the graphical
boot menu, pressing <TT>6</TT> to <TT>Escape to loader
prompt</TT> will show the same timer. The timer option looks
like this:</P>

<PRE>Hit [Enter] to boot immediately, or any other key for command prompt.
Booting [/boot/kernel/kernel] in 10 seconds...</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you press any key other than Enter, you'll
receive this:</P>

<PRE>Type '?' for a list of commands, 'help' for more detailed help.
OK <B>boot -s</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Type <TT>boot -s</TT> to enter single-user mode. The kernel
will appear to load normally, but, instead of processing the
<TT>rc</TT> scripts, this prompt will appear:</P>

<PRE>Enter full pathname of shell or RETURN for /bin/sh:
#</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Once you've finished making your desired changes,
simply type <TT>exit</TT>. The system will continue to boot
into multiuser mode.</P>

<P class="docText">Now, how do you prevent a user from doing that? Password protect
single-user mode by editing <I>/etc/ttys</I>. Find this
line:</P>

<PRE># If console is marked "insecure", then init will ask for the root password
# when going to single-user mode.

<P class="docText">Follow the comments and change the word <TT>secure</TT> to
<TT>insecure</TT>. While that may seem nonintuitive,
you're saying the system is considered to be
insecure, thus you want a password. The next time a user attempts
single-user mode, the kernel will load, but the user will receive
this prompt instead:</P>

<P class="docText">Let's <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2052"></A>
return
to the timer section of the boot process. A user can type more than
<TT>boot -s</TT> after interrupting the boot process. In
fact, if you press <TT>?</TT> at that <TT>OK</TT>
prompt, you'll see that you can unload the current
kernel, load another kernel, load and unload kernel modules, and view
and change variables. You can muck about with just about every part
of the boot process that would normally be controlled by the
<TT>loader</TT> command.</P>

<P class="docText">Fortunately, you can also require a user to input a password before
receiving that <TT>OK</TT> prompt. Set the
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2053"></A>
password by adding this line to
<I>/boot/loader.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE>password=12345</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Of course, your password should be harder to guess than
<TT>12345</TT>. Now the boot process will prompt the user
for a password. Without that password, you cannot enter single-user
mode or load or unload kernel modules. You can still boot; you just
cannot interrupt the boot process.</P>

<P class="docText">Also, if your CMOS supports it, you can require a password to boot
the machine. However, this is often considered to be a bad thing,
especially on a co-located web or mail server.</P>
