<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">For those times when you want to run a system
"headless.</span>"</P>

<P class="docText">Sometimes <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2056"></A>
it is a simple matter of economy.
Perhaps you've managed to scrounge up another
system, but you don't have enough monitors,
keyboards, or mice to go around. You also don't have
the budget to purchase either those or a KVM switch. Sometimes it is
a matter of security. Perhaps you're introducing a
PC to a server closet and your physical security policy prevents
server closet devices from being attached to monitors, keyboards, and
mice.</P>

<P class="docText">Before you can run a system
"headless," you need to have an
alternative for accessing that system. Once you've
removed input and output peripherals, your entry point into the
system is now either through the network card or a serial port.</P>

<P class="docText">Going in through the network card is the easiest and is quite secure
if you're using SSH. However, you should also
consider a plan B. What if for some reason the system becomes
inaccessible over the network? How do you get into the system then?
Do you really want to gather up a spare monitor, keyboard, and mouse
and carry them into the server closet?</P>

<P class="docText">A more attractive plan B may be to purchase a
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2057"></A>
<I>null modem cable</I>
as insurance. This is a crossed serial cable that is designed to go
from one computer's serial port to another
computer's serial port. This type of cable allows
you to access a system without going through the network, which is a
real lifesaver when the system isn't responding to
the network. You can purchase this type of cable at any store that
sells networking cables.</P>

<P class="docText">Your last consideration is whether the system BIOS will cooperate
with your plan. Most newer BIOSes will. Many have a CMOS option that
can be configured to disable "halt on
errors." It's always a good idea to
check out your available CMOS options before you start unplugging
your peripherals.</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-SECT-4.1"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.4.1 Preparing the System</H4>

<P class="docText">I've <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2058"></A>
just
installed a new FreeBSD 5.1 system. Since I didn't
have a null modem cable handy, I installed the old-fashioned way with
the monitor and keyboard attached. If you do have a null modem cable
and want to experiment with a headless install, follow the directions
in the Handbook section referenced at the end of this hack.</P>

<P class="docText">Since I want to access the server over the network,
I'll double-check that the NIC is properly
configured and that <TT>sshd</TT> is
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2059"></A>
running:</P>

<PRE>% <B>ifconfig ed0</B>
ed0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.2.94 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255
        ether 00:80:ad:79:4e:fd

% <B>sockstat | grep sshd</B>
root     sshd       389   4  tcp4   *:22                  *:*</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <TT>ifconfig</TT> command is used to verify an
interface's configuration; in this example, the
interface is <TT>ed0</TT>. The <TT>flags</TT>
indicate that this interface is <TT>UP</TT> and
<TT>RUNNING</TT>. The interface also has an IP address of
<TT>192.168.2.94</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">The <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2060"></A>
<TT>sockstat</TT> command is
similar to the <TT>netstat</TT> command, but I find it
provides a more intuitive output. For each open port it will display
the owner of the service (<TT>root</TT>), the name of the
service (<TT>sshd</TT>), the PID (<TT>389</TT>),
the socket file descriptor (<TT>4</TT>), the transport
(<TT>tcp4)</TT>, the local address
(<TT>*:22</TT>), and the foreign address
(<TT>*.*</TT>).</P>

<P class="docText">The PID is useful if you need to send a signal to the process. The
local address indicates which interfaces on this system (in this
case, all, or <TT>*</TT>) are listening on which port
number (<TT>22</TT>). There aren't any
current sessions, as the foreign address section is
<TT>*.*</TT>. If there were a current session, it would
show the address of the other system followed by the socket number
being used for the connection.</P>

<P class="docText">If for some reason <TT>sshd</TT> isn't
running on your system, add the following line to
<I>/etc/rc.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE>sshd_enable="YES"</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">and double-check that it'll be available at bootup,
like so:</P>

<PRE># <B>/etc/rc.d/sshd rcvar</B>
#sshd
$sshd_enable=YES</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Finally, typing <TT>sshd</TT> as the superuser should start
the daemon. You can prove this by checking that it's
listening with <TT>sockstat | grep sshd</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">One last test—I'll make sure I can log into
the system over the network:</P>

<PRE>% <B>ssh 192.168.2.94</B>
Password:
%</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Now that I knew the system was accessible over the network, it was
time for the moment of truth. After <TT>halt</TT>ing the
system, I entered its CMOS configuration. I was a little bit worried
because there weren't any options dealing with
"halt errors." Undaunted, I left
CMOS and powered off and unplugged the monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
I then opened the case and physically removed the video card.</P>

<P class="docText">When I powered up, the system responded with a longer than ordinary
beep. But after a few seconds, my hard drive light flashed and I
could hear the operating system probing my devices and loading the
drivers. After a moment or so, I tried to <TT>ssh</TT> into
the system and was greeted with my password prompt! Assuming your
BIOS is willing to cooperate, FreeBSD has no problem loading
headless.</P>

<P class="docText">Should <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2061"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2062"></A>
your system ever stop responding over
the network, you'll be glad you purchased that null
modem serial cable. Connect one end to the COM port of the headless
system, and the other end to the COM port of another system that you
can access either directly or over the network.</P>

<P class="docText">If that other system is running a Windows operating system, go to
Start <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> Programs <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> Accessories <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0>
Communications <img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> HyperTerminal (or open
<I>hypertrm.exe</I>). You'll need to
create a new connection, so choose a name and icon for it. Under
Connect using:, choose the COM port to which the serial cable is
attached.</P>

<P class="docText">You'll also have to configure the port properties
for that COM port. Change the default 2400 bits per second to 9600.
Finally, change hardware flow control to <TT>none</TT>.
Press Enter, and you should be connected to the headless system. If
you're not, double-check that you chose the correct
COM port.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're attaching from a system running any
variant of Unix, you can use either the <TT>cu</TT> or
<TT>tip</TT> commands to connect via the serial cable.</P>

<P class="docText">To <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2063"></A>
use
<TT>cu</TT>, simply specify your COM port using the line
switch <TT>-l</TT> and a speed of 9600 baud using the speed
switch <TT>-s</TT>. For example, this syntax allows you to
connect to COM2 or <TT>cuaa1</TT>:</P>

<PRE># <B>cu -l /dev/cuaa1 -s 9600</B>
Connected.</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">You should now be able to see what is happening on your headless
system. One of the advantages of connecting through a serial cable is
that you can watch the boot process of the system. You
can't do this over a network connection, because
initializing the network occurs toward the end of a successful boot.</P>

<P class="docText">Before the network can be initialized, the kernel must successfully
load into memory and the necessary hardware must be probed. If
you're having problems booting a system, it is
usually due to a missing or corrupt kernel or a hardware problem.</P>

<P class="docText">To disconnect from the <TT>cu</TT> session, type
<TT>~</TT>., then press the Enter key. You should receive a
<TT>Disconnected</TT>. message and receive the prompt of
the system you started from.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>tip</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2064"></A>
utility doesn't use
line or speed switches. It instead expects you to use one of the
finger friendly shortcuts found at the end of the
<I>/etc/remote</I> file. Let's take a
look at that section:</P>

<PRE># <B>tail /etc/remote</B>
# Hardwired line
cuaa0b|cua0b:dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#2400:pa=none:
cuaa0c|cua0c:dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#9600:pa=none:

# Finger friendly shortcuts
com1:dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#9600:pa=none:
com2:dv=/dev/cuaa1:br#9600:pa=none:
com3:dv=/dev/cuaa2:br#9600:pa=none:
com4:dv=/dev/cuaa3:br#9600:pa=none:</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Notice that there is an entry for each COM port. This means that to
connect to COM2, you simply have to type:</P>

<PRE># <B>tip com2</B>
connected</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">You need a little bit more coordination to disconnect, though. Hold
down Shift while you press the <TT>~</TT> key. Keep your
finger on Shift as you press the Ctrl key, then the letter D:</P>
