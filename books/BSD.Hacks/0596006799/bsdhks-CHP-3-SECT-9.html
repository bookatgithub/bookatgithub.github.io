 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2136"></A>
PAM (Pluggable

<P class="docText">Before using this module, spend some time reading
<TT>man</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2137"></A>
<TT>pam_passwdqc</TT>, as it
thoroughly covers each option and its possible values. Any values
contained within parentheses are defaults. As you read through this
manpage, compare those defaults with your own
network's security policy and make note of any
values that will require a change.</P>

<P class="docText">This PAM module is fairly comprehensive, allowing you to enable many
of the features expected in a password policy.
Here's an overview of the configurable features:</P>

<P class="docText">Once you've finished perusing the manpage, you
should have a list of values that you'll want to
modify to reflect your network's security policy.
Enabling <TT>pam_passwdqc</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-3-ITERM-2138"></A>
 is simply
a matter of adding or editing a line so that it contains your
customized options.</P>

<P class="docText">On FreeBSD 4.x, add that line to the <TT>password</TT>
section of <I>/etc/pam.conf</I>. On 5.x, edit instead
the <TT>password</TT> section of
<I>/etc/pam.d/passwd</I>. Let's look
at that file on a FreeBSD 5.1 system:</P>

<P class="docText">Obviously, you'll need to uncomment the
<TT>pam_passwdqc.so</TT> line to enable the module. Note
the one included option, <TT>enforce=users</TT>, overrides
the default setting of <TT>enforce=everyone</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Let's see what happens when I remove that remark and
then try to use <TT>passwd</TT> as a regular user named
<TT>test</TT>. Even though passwords
aren't echoed to the terminal, I've
shown in this output the passwords that I typed in:</P>

Changing local password for test
Old Password: <B>test</B>
You can now choose the new password or passphrase.
A valid password should be a mix of upper and lower case letters,
digits and other characters.  You can use an 8 character long
password with characters from at least 3 of these 4 classes, or
a 7 character long password containing characters from all the
classes.  Characters that form a common pattern are discarded by
the check.
A passphrase should be of at least 3 words, 12 to 40 characters
long and contain enough different characters.
Alternatively, if noone else can see your terminal now, you can
pick this as your password: "inward!smell:Milan".</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">As you can see, the password policy is provided, along with an
example of a strong password that meets the policy requirements.
Except for that one option, this particular policy includes the
default settings mentioned in <TT>man pam_passwdqc</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Here I tried to use the same password. Even worse, it
doesn't meet any of the password
policy's requirements. However,
<TT>pam_passwdqc</TT> rejected the password, gave me

<P class="docText">Looks like the default retry count is three, as I was booted out
after three tries. This time the password was long enough at eight
characters, but only contained numbers and lowercase characters. The
instructions clearly state that an eight-character password needs a
mix of three different types of characters.</P>

<P class="docText">It's important to note that if the superuser changes
a user's password, she will receive the same error
messages if the password does not comply with the policy. However,
after the error message, the superuser will be asked to retype that
poor password and it will be accepted. Why? Because of that
<TT>enforce=users</TT> option. If you remove that option,
it will default back to <TT>enforce=everyone</TT>, which
requires even the superuser to choose good passwords. The method you
choose will depend upon the security requirements of your password

<P class="docText">It's

easy to change the default settings.
Simply add your option to the end of the
