the IDE controller on my web server

what I had known in the back of my mind all along: I had not been
making regular remote backups of my server, and the local backups
were of no use to me now that the drive was corrupted.</P>

wasn't automatic and effortless. Admittedly, this
was no one's fault but my own, but my frustration

<P class="docText"><TT>rsnapshot</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-4-ITERM-2262"></A>
has
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-4-ITERM-2263"></A>
no idea how often you want to
take snapshots. In order to specify how much data to save, you need
to tell <TT>rsnapshot</TT> which intervals to keep, and how
many of each.</P>

<P class="docText">By default, a snapshot will occur every four hours, or six times a
day (these are the hourly intervals). It will also keep a second set
of snapshots, taken once a day and stored for a week (or seven days):</P>

<PRE>interval    hourly  6
interval    daily   7</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that the hourly interval is specified first. This is very
important, as the first interval line is assumed to be the smallest
unit of time, with each additional line getting successively bigger.
Thus, if you add a yearly interval, it should go at the bottom, and
if you add a minutes interval, it should go before the hourly
interval. It's also worth noting that the snapshots
are pulled up from the smallest interval to the largest. In this
example, the daily snapshots are pulled from the oldest hourly
snapshot, not directly from the main filesystem.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>backup</TT> section tells
<TT>rsnapshot</TT> which files you actually want to back
up:</P>

<PRE>backup      /etc/      localhost/etc/</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">In this example, <TT>backup</TT> is the backup point,
<I>/etc/</I> is the full path to the directory we want
to take snapshots of, and <I>localhost/etc/</I> is a
subdirectory <span class="docEmphasis">inside</span> <span class="docEmphasis">the snapshot
root</span> where the snapshots are stored. If you are taking
snapshots of several machines on one dedicated backup server,
it's a good idea to use hostnames as directories to
keep track of which files came from which server.</P>

<P class="docText">In addition to full paths on the local filesystem, you can also back
up remote systems using
<TT>rsync</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-4-ITERM-2264"></A>

have <TT>ssh</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-4-ITERM-2265"></A>

this:</P>

<P class="docText">When <TT>rsnapshot</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-4-ITERM-2271"></A>
first runs, it will create the
configured <I>snapshot_root</I> directory. It assigns
this directory the permissions <TT>0700</TT> since the
snapshots will probably contain files owned by all sorts of users on
your system.</P>

<P class="docText">The simplest but least flexible solution is to disallow access to the
snapshot root altogether. The root user will still have access, of
course, and will be the only one who can pull backups. This may or
may not be desirable, depending on your situation. For a small setup,
this may be sufficient.</P>

<P class="docText">If users need to be able to pull their own backups, you will need to
do a little extra work up front. The best option seems to be creating
a container directory for the snapshot root with
<TT>0700</TT> permissions, giving the snapshot root
directory <TT>0755</TT> permissions, and mounting the
snapshot root for the users as read-only using NFS or Samba.</P>
