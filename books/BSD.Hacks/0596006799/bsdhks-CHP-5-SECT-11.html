<P class="docText">In this age of GUIs and feature-rich browsers, it's
easy to forget how quick and efficient command-line
<TT>ftp</TT> can be. That is, until you're
logged into a system that doesn't have X installed,
nor a browser, nor any fancy FTP programs. If it's
really your lucky day, it won't even have any
manpages. And, of course, you'll need to download
something.</P>

<P class="docText">Perhaps you find yourself using <TT>ftp</TT> all the time,
always going to the same FTP servers and downloading from or
uploading to the same directories. Clearly, it's
time for some FTP automation.</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2508"></A>
you ever noticed how easy it is to use
FTP from a modern browser? Simply click on a hyperlink to start a
download. At the command line, though, you can't
even browse the FTP directory structure until you successfully log
into the FTP server. Well, guess what: you
<span class="docEmphasis">always</span> have to log into an FTP server.
It's just that your web browser hides this little
detail by doing it for you in the background.</P>

<P class="docText">You can achieve the same transparency for command-line
<TT>ftp</TT> by creating a file called
<I>.netrc</I> in your home directory and placing the
following line in that file:</P>

<PRE>% <B>more ~/.netrc</B>
default login anonymous password genisis@istar.ca</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This line will work for any FTP server on the Internet that accepts
anonymous logins. (Most do, unless it's a private
server.) When creating your own file, use your own email address as
the password.</P>

<P class="docText">Test your change with this command:</P>

<PRE>% <B>ftp ftp.freebsd.org</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Compare your results to the FTP output in  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-4.html#bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-4"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #71]</span></A> . You should receive the same
banner shown there without having to first type in a username and
password.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're a webmaster who uses FTP to upload your
new files, you do have to log in first. After all, you
don't want just anyone uploading files, so you
require a username and password. To automate that process, add a
section to your <I>~.netrc</I> that reflects the name
of your server and your username and password:</P>

<PRE>machine <TT><I>ftp.myserver.com</I></TT>
login <TT><I>myusername</I></TT>
password <TT><I>mypassword</I></TT></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Since you've just inserted your password into a
plain text file, it's important to change the
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2509"></A>
permissions on this file so that
only you can read it:</P>

<PRE>% <B>chmod 600 ~/.netrc</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you forget to change the permissions and try to access an FTP
server that requires a username and password, your login attempt
should fail and result in this error message:</P>

<PRE>ftp: Error: .netrc file is readable by others.
ftp: Remove password or make file unreadable by others.</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">To be extra safe, exclude the <TT>password</TT> line
completely. When you connect to the FTP server, your username will be
provided for you, but you will still be prompted for the password.</P>

<P class="docText">Now, <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2510"></A>

let's say
that you visit <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="ftp.freebsd.org">ftp.freebsd.org</A> on
a regular basis and always access its
<I>pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386</I> directory. Rather than
<TT>cd</TT>ing every time, you can automate that process by
creating an FTP macro. Add these lines to
<I>~/.netrc</I>:</P>

<PRE>macdef fbsd
bin
cd /pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText"><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2512"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2513"></A>
Macros are defined by
<TT>macdef</TT>, and the name of the macro follows. Keep
the name short but useful, as a macro is supposed to be a timesaver.
Once you've declared the macro, add the FTP commands
you want to execute, one line at a time. This particular macro
contains the <TT>bin</TT> (or <TT>binary</TT>)
command. That command is useful when downloading because it ensures
all files, including non-ASCII files such as applications, will
download correctly. I also included a <TT>cd</TT> command
to automatically take me to my usual working directory.</P>

<P class="docText">It's important that a macro always ends with a blank

</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></P><br>

<P class="docText">There are two ways to use your macro. If you're
already connected to the FTP server, type <TT>$</TT>
<TT><I>macroname</I></TT> at the
<TT>ftp</TT> prompt:</P>

<PRE>ftp&gt; <B>$ fbsd</B>
bin
200 Type set to I.
cd /pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386
250 "/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386" is new cwd.</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that each command in the macro will be executed, followed by its
results.</P>

<P class="docText">The second way to run the macro is when you first invoke the
<TT>ftp</TT> command:</P>

<PRE>% <B>echo "$ fbsd" | ftp ftp.freebsd.org</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Now, if you try that one, you'll notice that all of
your commands will succeed. Then, your FTP session will abruptly end,
and you'll receive your regular prompt back! Rather
disappointing if you were planning on typing some more commands at
the <TT>ftp</TT> prompt, but absolutely perfect if your
intention is to script an entire FTP session.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.11.3 Scripting an Entire Session</H4>

<P class="docText">If <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2514"></A>
you already know what you want
to do, and especially if you need to do it more than once, why type
in everything at the <TT>ftp</TT> prompt? Suppose you want
to download the latest XFree86 distribution directly from <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/">ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/</A>. Consider placing this
macro in <I>~/.netrc</I>:</P>

<PRE>macdef X
bin
bell
prompt
cd /pub/XFree86/4.3.0/source
mget *
bye</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This macro assumes that this <I>~/.netrc</I> file
already contains the line that allows anonymous logins.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>bell</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2515"></A>
command, which is optional, should
produce a sound after each successful file transfer. The
<TT>prompt</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2516"></A>
command is very important, though. By
default, the FTP server expects interaction from the user. That is,
when you ask to download multiple files with <TT>mget</TT>,
the FTP server will wait for you to confirm every transfer by typing
<TT>y</TT>. Obviously, we want to disable that behavior
when we're scripting a download.</P>

<P class="docText">To run this macro:</P>

<PRE>% <B>echo "$ X" | ftp ftp.xfree86.org</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">By default, <TT>ftp</TT> will save the downloaded files in
your current working directory. If you prefer, you can specify an
alternate location in your <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2517"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2518"></A>

matter how hard you try to make the default
FTP client user-friendly, it is still a very basic command, and you
