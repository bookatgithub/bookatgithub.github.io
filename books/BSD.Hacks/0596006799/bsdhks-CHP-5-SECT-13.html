large
network can be a daunting task. Even with the Unix utilities
available for remote administration, making changes on many systems
can be taxing. Scripting tools make life easier to some extent, but
some tasks require hands- and eyes-on interaction.</P>

<P class="docText">Several system utilities allow you to execute the same command on
multiple hosts. This form of loosely coupled clustering is useful for
information gathering and some monitoring purposes. However, on some
occasions, you not only need to run a process on multiple hosts, but
you must also observe it and interact with the process to resolve
host-specific issues. An administration shell script will save typing
and minimize mistakes, but it's hard to write a
script that will work correctly on every machine on a diverse
network.</P>

<P class="docText">Wouldn't it be nice if there were a program that
allowed you to interact with your remote hosts while running parallel
commands? Enter ClusterIt.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.13.1 Why ClusterIt?</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2537"></A>
ClusterIt is a set of tools written by Tim
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2538"></A>
Rightnour,
designed to place all of your network hosts at your fingertips.
ClusterIt includes utilities for running a single command on all of
the hosts in your cluster. It also allows automatic distribution of
the tasks to any available hosts in a defined group. It uses a remote
login method, such as <TT>sshd</TT> on the target hosts, so
you only need to install it on the control host.</P>

<P class="docText">Scripts can also synchronize between task completions on different
hosts. For example, you can set two hosts to compile an application
and install it on the other machine. Neither host should begin the
installation until the other host has finished compiling, but it is
impossible to predict which host will finish first. ClusterIt defines
barrier operations that can be included in a script to prevent
passing a synchronization point until all hosts have caught up.</P>

<P class="docText">In most clustering systems for Unix, once you issue a command, you
cannot interact with the hosts in the cluster individually; you only
see the final output of each command run on each of the hosts.
ClusterIt does not have this limitation, making it ideal for dealing
with processes that need continual monitoring.</P>

<P class="docText">It is also available in FreeBSD's

<P class="docText">Before using any ClusterIt utility, you must create a list of
machines in your cluster. Create the file
<I>~/.cluster</I>, containing a list of host names. Be

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.13.3 Testing Noninteractive Commands</H4>

<P class="docText">Now you're ready to issue commands to the
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2540"></A>
cluster. You can run simple
commands that require no interactivity from the command line with the
<TT>dsh</TT> (distributed shell) command.
Let's start by checking the version of the operating
system on each of the hosts in a group:</P>

<PRE>% <B>dsh -g setB uname -a</B>
Bester: SunOS bester 5.7 Generic_106541-11 sun4u sparc 
SUNW,UltraSPARC-IIi-Engine
Brust: NetBSD brust 1.6ZC NetBSD 1.6ZC (GENERIC.MP) #1: Fri Sep 26 
23:33:56 EDT 2003  
david@pohl:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC.MP i386</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <TT>-g</TT> <TT><I>groupname</I></TT> option
specifies which hosts in the cluster should run this command. Every
ClusterIt command allows you to specify a list of hosts, a named
group of hosts, the entire cluster, or any of those options minus a
list of excluded hosts.</P>

<P class="docText">As you can see, not much can go wrong with the
<TT>uname</TT> command. Interestingly, the two hosts that
I've chosen to use for examples are running
different operating systems.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-SECT-13.4"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.13.4 Using dvt</H4>

<P class="docText">Many maintenance operations require different steps on machines
running different operating systems. ClusterIt also includes a
command <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2541"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2542"></A>
called
<TT>dvt</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2543"></A>
 (distributed virtual
terminal), which allows you to interact with several hosts
simultaneously or individually. This is where <TT>dvt</TT>
shines!</P>

<P class="docText">Suppose that I want to install a Perl module on both of these example
machines. First, I'll open the distributed
terminals:</P>

<PRE>% <B>dvt -g setB</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Three terminal windows have opened up to my screen: one window for
each of the two hosts and one control window. Anything I type in the
control window goes to all of the host windows, as if I typed the
same thing in each one. (I can also type within an individual host
window, which will send my input only to that particular host.)</P>

<P class="docText">I have windows open to the hosts in the group now, but
I'll need to be <TT>root</TT> to install
the module.</P>

<P class="docText">In the control window, I'll type
<TT>su</TT>. If the root password is the same on all the
hosts, I can type it everywhere at once by typing in the command
window. If the passwords are different on different hosts,
I'll have to activate each host window in turn,
typing the appropriate password in each one.</P>

<P class="docText">For simplicity, imagine I've already copied the
module to my home directory on each host. I now need to
un-<TT>tar</TT> it, run Perl on the
<I>Makefile.PL</I>, run <TT>make</TT>, and
run <TT>make install</TT>:</P>

<PRE># <B>tar xzvf Perl-Package-1.0.tgz &amp;&amp; cd Perl-Package-1.0 &amp;&amp; perl</B> \ 
  <B>Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If I knew that this command would work without any errors, I could
have used <TT>dsh</TT> instead. However, any number of
differences between these two machines could cause one or both to
fail to complete this process. This Perl package may not have been
tested on Solaris yet, or either machine could be missing some
prerequisite package.</P>

<P class="docText">Since each host has its own window that I can view and type into, I
can monitor the progress of the installation. If either host
encounters a problem, I can focus my mouse on that window and
manually correct and continue the process, without interfering with
the other host.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.13.5 Hacking the Hack</H4>

<P class="docText">This technique is useful in several other situations. You can monitor
a set of hosts by running <TT>ps</TT>,
<TT>who</TT>, or <TT>top</TT> in several windows.
You can diagnose network issues by running <TT>tcpdump</TT>
on the source host, destination host, and any machines routing the
packets in between the two.</P>

<P class="docText">An interesting way to troubleshoot networking is to have every host
in your cluster <TT>ping</TT> or
<TT>traceroute</TT> to the problem host. The missing route
or mistyped filter rule quickly becomes obvious.</P>

<P class="docText">A sysadmin must troubleshoot all sorts of issues, including
diagnosing name service troubles, NFS mount permissions,
<TT>sysctl</TT> values, disk space, routing tables,
backups, and logfiles. You can solve these problems more easily when
you have a consolidated view of <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2544"></A>
