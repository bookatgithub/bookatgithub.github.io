I know what
you're thinking. There's never a
legitimate reason to spoof any type of address, right? Even if there
were, why would you bother to spoof a MAC address, other than to
prove that it can be done?</P>

<P class="docText">Consider the following scenario. I was administrating a small network
where the ISP restricted the number of IP addresses a <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2343"></A>
DHCP client was allowed to receive.
Their DHCP server kept track of the leased addresses by using a
combination of the client's MAC address and an OS
identifier. One day I needed to replace that
network's external NIC. It took me a while to figure
out why the new NIC refused to pick up a DHCP address from the ISP.
Once the restriction was explained to me, I contemplated my available
courses of action. One was to spend the afternoon listening to Musak
in the hopes that I'd eventually get to speak to one
of the ISP's customer service representatives. I
decided my time would be better spent if I instead took 30 seconds
and spoofed the old MAC address. This provided a quick solution that
allowed the owner to get back online until he could make arrangements
with the ISP regarding the new MAC address.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.3.1 Spoofing on FreeBSD</H4>

<P class="docText">Before <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2344"></A>
I could accomplish the spoof, I needed
two pieces of information. The first was the MAC address for the old
NIC. Fortunately, I record such things in a binder. However, I
initially found out that information <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2345"></A>
using <TT>ifconfig</TT>.
In this scenario, the interface in question was called
<TT>rl0</TT>:</P>

<PRE>% <B>ifconfig rl0</B>
rl0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.2.12 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255
        ether 00:05:5d:d2:19:b7
        media: Ethernet autoselect (10baseT/UTP)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The MAC address is the hex number immediately following
<TT>ether</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Second, I needed to know the identifier used by the
ISP's DHCP server. This was found in the DHCP lease:</P>

<PRE>% <B>more /var/db/dhclient.leases | grep host</B>
option host-name "00-05-5d-d2-19-b7-36-33"</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Some ISPs use <TT>option host-name</TT>, while others use
<TT>option dhcp-client-identifier</TT>. Choose the option
in the lease that is associated with the MAC address. In this
example, my identifier was the MAC address, followed by
<TT>-36-33</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Armed with the information I needed, I could spoof the old MAC
address onto the new NIC card. In my case, the new card was an
<TT>ed0</TT>:</P>

<PRE># <B>ifconfig ed0 ether 00:05:5d:d2:19:b7</B>

#
# <B>ifconfig ed0 | grep ether</B>
ether 00:05:5d:d2:19:b7</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that you have to be the superuser to change these settings.</P>

<P class="docText">This particular change won't survive a reboot, as
the NIC will give the kernel its burnt-in MAC address during the
hardware probe that occurs during bootup. If you intend to reboot
before sorting out the situation with the ISP, carefully add this
line to <I>/etc/rc.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE>ifconfig_ed0_alias0="ether 00:05:5d:d2:19:b7"</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This will create an alias for <TT>ed0</TT> that uses the
desired MAC address, rather than the MAC address burnt into the
physical card. Think of an alias as an alternate set of instructions
an interface can give to the kernel—a kind of networking
nickname.</P>

<P class="docText">Next, I'll edit<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2346"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2347"></A>
 <I>/etc/dhclient.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE># <B>vi /etc/dhclient.conf</B>

#
#        This file is required by the ISC DHCP client.
#        See ``man 5 dhclient.conf'' for details.
#
#        In most cases an empty file is sufficient for most people as the
#        defaults are usually fine.

<B>interface "ed0" {</B>
<B>    send host-name "00-05-5d-d2-19-b7-36-33";</B>
<B>    send dhcp-client-identifier "00-05-5d-d2-19-b7-36-33";</B>
<B>}</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">By default, this file contains only comments; I added a section for
interface <TT>ed0</TT>. When editing your own file,
remember to include the opening and closing curly braces
(<TT>{}</TT>). Each statement must also end in a semicolon
(<TT>;</TT>). Here, I've set both the
<TT>host-name</TT> and the
<TT>dhcp-client-identifier</TT> options to the values
expected by the ISP.</P>

<P class="docText">Now it's time to test that these changes did indeed
work. You don't need to reboot in order to test that
alias in <I>/etc/rc.conf</I>. This <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2348"></A>

<P class="docText">Excellent. The new NIC kept the spoofed MAC address. Now
let's see how the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2350"></A>

and try to renew an <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2351"></A>

<PRE># <B>dhclient -r ed0</B>
#</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Using <TT>-r</TT> with <TT>dhclient</TT> forces
the DHCP client to give up its old address and request a new lease
from the DHCP server. If this succeeds, the prompt will return
without any error messages. Running <TT>ifconfig ed0</TT>
will show that the ISP's DHCP server did indeed give
this interface a public IP <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2352"></A>
