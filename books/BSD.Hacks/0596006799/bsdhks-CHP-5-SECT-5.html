 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2379"></A>
this all too common event may
happen: while you're away from your network, your
connection dies. Whether the ISP drops it, the cable gets unplugged
or the server behind your <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2380"></A>
NAT box dies, it is gone. You are
now lost at sea, not knowing what is actually going on back at home.
You <TT>ping</TT>, <TT>telnet</TT>, and pray to
the network gods, but nothing seems to work.</P>

<P class="docText">Wouldn't it be better if your network could
recognize that it has lost that connection and find a way for you to
get back in touch? The system that I set up did just that. All it
took was a well-configured OpenBSD firewall with NAT and a short Ruby
program that uses the Jabber protocol to get my attention.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.5.1 Hardware Configuration</H4>

<P class="docText">I use OpenBSD on a 486 to make my network resistant to total
connectivity failure. The computer has two network cards, one for the
DSL bridge and the other for the rest of the network. In addition, I
managed to find a 56k ISA modem.</P>

<P class="docText">Since this computer provides little more than firewall and NAT
services, it's more than capable of serving a small
home or business network. The DSL bridge provides the primary
Internet connection with a static IP. The service through my provider
is usually quite good, but there have been troubled times. The house
has only one phone line, which is plugged into the 56k modem in the
same computer as the DSL line. You could easily make the modem
computer a different machine entirely, but I found that this 486 is
quite compact and sufficient for my purposes.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-SECT-5.2"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.5.2 Connectivity Software</H4>

<P class="docText">The current OpenBSD operating system (Version 3.4 as of this writing)
comes with a wonderful firewall and NAT package, named Packet Filter
(PF). PF works well on a day-to-day basis moving my packets from the
network to the Internet. Unfortunately, it does not handle the loss
of the connection to the ISP. A full discussion for configuring PF is
beyond the scope of this hack, but you can find what you need from
the OpenBSD PF FAQ at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html">http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">When the unthinkable happens and your network falls off the Internet,
you may fall back to your trusty 56k modem. The idea is that the
modem will dial out automatically once your main connection goes
away. First, though, you need some way to detect that your connection
is lost. I use a slow <TT>ping</TT>
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2381"></A>
to the router
on the other end of my DSL connection.</P>

<P class="docText">I run this heartbeat from <TT>cron</TT> instead of using a
daemon process. It sends three pings at two-second intervals every 10
minutes—a very conservative test, especially if you are only
sending to your local gateway. Here is the <TT>cron</TT>
entry:</P>

<PRE>*/10 * * * * /usr/local/testconnect/testconnect.sh</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <I>testconnect.sh</I> script resembles this:</P>

<PRE>#!/bin/sh

# First gather data about your connection
PINGS=`ping -c 1 -i 2 [your gateway] | wc -l`

# Apply test and execute on result
if [ -f /tmp/lostconnection.lock ]
then
  echo "Lockfile in place"
else
  echo "No lockfile"
  if [ $PINGS -lt 8 ]
  then
    echo "Connection lost, commencing dialup"
    touch /tmp/lostconnection.lock
    pfctl -d
    ppp -nat internet
    ruby /usr/local/testconnect/send_new_ip.rb
  else
    echo "All is well"
  fi
fi</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If the gateway is unavailable, then the <TT>ping</TT>s will
time out and generate a short ping result. By counting the number of
letters (with <TT>wc -l</TT>) and applying a length test
(<TT>if [ $PINGS -lt 8]</TT>), the script can tell if the
<TT>ping</TT>s failed. In the case of failure, the script
goes through the steps to give you connectivity through alternative
means and to stop it from doing it every 10 minutes if things go
really wrong.</P>

<P class="docText">First, it creates a lockfile to ensure future runs of this script do
not dial out over and over again. Second, it shuts down the current
NAT interface to make way for the next step. Third, it fires up the
modem and connects to my emergency ISP using a preconfigured
<I>ppp.conf</I> profile called
<TT>internet</TT>. Here, I enabled NAT
(<TT>-nat</TT>) over PPP so that computers at my house will
only notice that the service is slow. The Internet connection will
still function in the same way. Finally, I run a script to alert me
to the failure.</P>

<P class="docText">You may have noticed one flaw in this setup. Most cheap ISP services
usually do not give you the same IP address when you dial into them.
How do you know how to contact your reconnected gateway from the
outside? Easy: have the computer tell you.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.5.3 Jabber and Ruby to the Rescue!</H4>

<P class="docText">There are many ways a computer can contact you with its current
status. I decided to use <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2382"></A>
Jabber because I spend a fair amount of
time with a Jabber session running. This script will notify me
quickly if something untoward happens to my connection at home, such
as an incident involving the vacuum cleaner.</P>

<P class="docText">I figured that a message from my computer with the current network
configuration would provide enough information to allow me to log in
remotely. The most important information is the current IP address of
the backup PPP connection. I decided to create a Ruby script using
the Jabber4r module to accomplish this:</P>

<PRE>require 'jabber4r/jabber4r'

now    = `date`.chomp!
ipdata = `/sbin/ifconfig tun0`

session = Jabber::Session.bind_digest("user@jabberserver/modem", "secret")
session.new_chat_message("user@jabberserver").
   set_body("I had to dial up for internet access at #{now}.\n#{ipdata}\n")
      .send

sleep 5
session.close</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The Ruby script grabs the current time and state of the
<TT>tun0</TT> interface, which contains the current IP
address assigned by the dial-up ISP. Armed with that IP address, you
can then <TT>ssh</TT> into your computer and begin to
diagnose the situation.</P>

<P class="docText">The Jabber4r module lives at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://jabber4r.rubyforge.org/">http://jabber4r.rubyforge.org/</A>. You will also
need the REXML module from <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/</A>.
Both of these installed without issue on top of the Ruby package that
shipped with OpenBSD 3.4.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-SECT-5.4"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.5.4 The Last Piece</H4>

<P class="docText">After your connection has been restored, you need to clean up. You
will need to stop <TT>ppp</TT>, start PF
again—hopefully with <TT>pfctl</TT>—and remove
the lockfile that prevents the
<I>/tmp/testconnect.sh</I> script from dialing out over
and over. After that, you should be back to normal, at least until
the next mishap.</P>
