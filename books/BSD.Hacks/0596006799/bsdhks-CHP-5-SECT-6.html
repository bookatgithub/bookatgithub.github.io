of the most useful utilities in a
network administrator's tool belt is
<TT>tcpdump</TT>. While you probably agree, I bet the very
thought of wading through a <TT>tcpdump</TT> sniff makes
you groan. Take heart: I'll walk you through some
concrete examples that show how to zero in on the information you
need to solve the particular network problem that prompted you to
consider doing a packet sniff in the first place.</P>

<P class="docText">You might be thinking, "Why bother? There are much
nicer utilities out there." That's
true. My personal favorite happens to be <TT>ethereal</TT>.
However, you don't always have the luxury of working
on a system that allows you to install third-party utilities or, for
that matter, even has X installed. <TT>tcpdump</TT> is
guaranteed to be on your BSD system. It's there,
it's quick, it's dirty, and
it's darn effective if you know how to harness its
power.</P>

Before you can capture any packets, you need to be the superuser. You
also need to have the <TT>bpf</TT> device in your kernel.
If you're using the GENERIC kernel,
you're set. If you've created your
own custom kernel  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-2.html#bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-2"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #54]</span></A>,

configuration file is called <I>CUSTOM</I>:</P>

# The 'bpf' device enables the Berkeley Packet Filter.
device    bpf    #Berkeley packet filter</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">You also need to know the names of your interfaces and which
interface is cabled to the network you wish to sniff. You can find
this <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2393"></A>
with
<TT>ifconfig</TT>:</P>

<P class="docText">This particular system has three Ethernet (<TT>ether</TT>)
cards attached to three different networks. Since
I'm interested in the traffic on the 192.168.2.0
network, I'll use the <TT>ed0</TT>
interface.</P>

<P class="docText">To start a capture, simply specify the interface
you're interested in, with the interface
(<TT>-i</TT>) switch:</P>

tcpdump: listening on ed0
<B>Ctrl t</B>
tcpdump: 24 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel
<B>Ctrl c</B>
33 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">You will lose your prompt for the duration of the dump, and captured
packets will be displayed to your terminal (these
weren't shown in this example's
output). If you press Ctrl-t, you can see how many packets have been
captured so far and how many have been dropped, if any. If
you're dropping packets, that means packets are
arriving faster than <TT>tcpdump</TT> can process them. To
end your sniff, press Ctrl-c and you'll return to
your prompt.</P>

<P class="docText">Unless you're a speed reader or have a very boring
network, you'll probably prefer to send the captured
packets to a file. Use the <TT>-w</TT> (write) switch to
specify the name of the file you'd like to

you try the previous
examples on a moderately busy network, you'll
probably remind yourself why you don't like using
<TT>tcpdump</TT>. In a minute you can capture hundreds of
seemingly unintelligible lines of numbers. You're
wasting time and brain cells if you're wading
through hundreds of lines and you're interested in
only two or three of them. You can save on both of those precious
resources if you spend a few minutes creating a display filter.</P>

<P class="docText">There's always a reason behind a packet sniff.
<TT>tcpdump</TT> is a very intelligent utility, but
it's not a mind reader. However, if you can convert
your reason into syntax that <TT>tcpdump</TT> understands,
you can create a filter that will display only
<span class="docEmphasis">interesting</span> packets.</P>

<P class="docText">Let's say that you suspect broadcast packets are
slowing down a network segment. This incantation will capture only
broadcast packets:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 broadcast</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">When you end your capture, you'll find that the
number of packets received by the filter will be greater than the
number of packets displayed to your screen. This means that
<TT>tcpdump</TT> will still capture all packets, but will
display only the packets matching your filter. This can give you a
good idea of ratio. For example, if you captured 100 packets in a
minute and only 4 of those packets were broadcasts, then broadcasts
probably aren't an issue on that network.</P>

<P class="docText">Next example: a particular workstation is having problems connecting
to a server. Create a filter that zeros in on the packets between
those two systems, in this case, <TT>genisis</TT> and
<TT>server1</TT>:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 host genisis and server1</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">In this example, I only have to use the <TT>host</TT>
keyword once, as it is assumed until I specify a different keyword.
If I really like to type (which I don't), it would
have been just as correct to type <TT>host genisis and host
server1</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">You can also fine-tune that syntax to unidirectional traffic like so:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 src host genisis and dst host server1</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">That will show only the traffic that was created at
<TT>genesis</TT> and is destined for
<TT>server1</TT>. This time I had to repeat the word
<TT>host</TT>, as one incantation was <TT>src
host</TT> while the other was <TT>dst host</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Suppose you're interested in only ICMP traffic:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 icmp</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">or perhaps only ARP traffic:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 arp</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Perhaps you're having a problem with IKE, which uses
UDP port 500:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 udp port 500</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">As you can see, <TT>tcpdump</TT> comes with many keywords
that assist you in creating a display filter suited to your needs.
These keywords are building blocks for more complex expressions. When
you do your own combinations, you might find it easier to use the
words <TT>and</TT>, <TT>or</TT>, and
<TT>not</TT>. For example, this will capture all traffic on
network 192.168.2.0 that is not ARP-based:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 net 192.168.2 and not arp</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Of course, you can find all of the keywords, along with examples, in
<TT>man</TT> <TT>tcpdump</TT>.
I've highlighted only the most commonly used
keywords.</P>

<P class="docText"><TT>tcpdump</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2398"></A>
is capable of zeroing in on any
particular field in a packet. In order to harness this power,
it's useful to have a picture of the various types
of <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2399"></A>
headers
in front of you. Once you have a picture of the fields contained
within the particular header you're interested in,
the examples in <TT>man tcpdump</TT> will make a lot more
sense.</P>

<P class="docText">You'll know you're creating a very
specific filter if your <TT>tcpdump</TT> expression
contains the name of a protocol followed by square brackets
(<TT>[ ]</TT>). Let's take a look at this
example from the manpage, which is designed to capture only SYN-1s,
the first packet in the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2400"></A>
TCP three-way handshake. Remember that
square brackets may have special meaning to the shell, so quote
complex expressions to prevent weird syntax errors:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 'tcp[13] =  = 2'</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you're familiar with the three-way handshake, you
know that it involves the
<span class="docEmphasis">flags</span><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2401"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2402"></A>
 field of a TCP header.
Let's find that particular field within the TCP
header. <A class="docLink" HREF="#bsdhks-CHP-5-FIG-1">Figure 5-1</A> shows the header fields of a TCP

<P class="docText">The number enclosed within the <TT>[ ]</TT> represents how
many octets into the header a particular field occurs. Each line, or
word, of a header is 4 octets long. The Flags field is after the
first three words (i.e., 12 octets) and occurs one more octet in,
just after the Data Offset and Reserved fields. So, this particular
TCP field occurs in octet 13 and is represented by
<TT>tcp[13]</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Still with me? Okay, where'd the <TT>= =
2</TT> come from? For that one, you need to know the names of
the flags as well as the decimal equivalents for each binary bit that

<P class="docText">Finally, you need to know that the first packet in the three-way
handshake is distinguished by just the SYN flag being turned on.
Since all of the other flags will be turned off and will therefore
contain a value of 0, a value of 2 in this field indicates that only
the SYN bit is enabled.</P>

<P class="docText">If math isn't your strong point, there is an
alternate way to write this particular expression:</P>

<PRE># <B>tcpdump -i ed0 'tcp[tcpflags] =  =tcp-syn'</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If the particular field you're interested in happens
to be the TCP flags field, the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2403"></A>
ICMP type field, or the
ICMP code field, you're in luck. Those three fields
are predefined, so you don't have to count how many
octets in that field occurs in the header. So:</P>

<P class="docText">Each starts with a <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2411"></A>
