DNS is one
of those network services that has to be configured carefully and
tested regularly. A misconfigured DNS server can prevent the world
from finding your web and mail servers. Worse, a misconfigured DNS
server can allow the world to find more than just your web and mail
servers.</P>

<P class="docText">Even if you're not a DNS administrator, you should
still know some handy DNS commands. The simple truth is, if DNS
isn't working, you're not going
anywhere. That means no surfing, no downloading, and no email for
you.</P>

<P class="docText"><TT>dig</TT> results <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2422"></A>
are divided into sections. Not
surprisingly, the <TT>ANSWER SECTION</TT> answers the
question asked; in this case, "What are the
nameservers for <span class="docEmphasis">sympatico.ca</span>?"
In DNS, each entry in the DNS database is called a
<I>record</I>. The answer indicates that
<span class="docEmphasis">sympatico.ca</span> has four nameservers. Their
hostnames are:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList"><TT>ns5.bellnexxia.net</TT></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><TT>ns6.bellnexxia.net</TT></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><TT>dns1.sympatico.ca</TT></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><TT>dns2.sympatico.ca</TT></P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">The next section, <TT>ADDITIONAL SECTION</TT>, maps each
hostname in the <TT>ANSWER</TT> <TT>SECTION</TT>
to its corresponding IP address. As an end user,
you're really interested in the IP addresses of your
nameservers, not their names. You need the address of least
<span class="docEmphasis">one</span> DNS server before you can resolve
<span class="docEmphasis">any</span> name to an address.</P>

<P class="docText">The other thing I'd like to point out is the type of
records that were returned in the output. Notice that each nameserver
record had an <TT>NS</TT>. If you ever see
<TT>NS</TT> in a DNS database, you know
you're looking at a DNS server record. Also, all
hosts, regardless of whether they also happen to be a DNS server, web
server, or mail server, have an <TT>A</TT> record. An
<TT>A</TT> record maps a hostname to an IP address. In
other words, a DNS server has two records: the <TT>NS</TT>
record indicates that it is a DNS server, and the
<TT>A</TT> record lists its IP address.</P>

<P class="docText">Can you tell which of the four
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2423"></A>

primary nameserver? You could look at the names and try to figure it
out from there. However, it is possible to find out for sure, and
it's easy once you know that <TT>SOA</TT>,
the start of authority record, indicates the primary nameserver.

dns1.sympatico.ca.        13m38s IN A        204.101.251.1</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Two of the four nameservers live on network 204.101.252, and the
other two live on network 209.226.175. This is actually a good
network design. Several attacks against high-profile companies have
succeeded because their DNS servers were all on the same subnet of
the same network. (See this article about DNS troubles at Microsoft
for an example: <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m0FOX/3_6/75645162/p1/article.jhtml">http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m0FOX/3_6/75645162/p1/article.jhtml</A>.)</P>

<P class="docText">Realistically, to provide such protection, your company has to enter
into an agreement with another company willing to host a copy of your
DNS database. That other company may be your ISP, or perhaps a sister
company. While adding redundancy, this also adds complexity and
another element of trust. It's one thing to keep
your own DNS servers up-to-date, fully patched, and securely
configured. It's quite another to work with another
administrator and assume that she has the resources to devote the
same time and effort to your DNS servers.</P>

<P class="docText">Regardless of how the network is organized, someone has to address
the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2433"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2434"></A>
issue of
<I>zone transfers</I>. In DNS, your database is
called a <I>zone</I>, as it really is just a portion
of the globally distributed DNS database. When you need to make a
change to your zone, you edit the database on the primary DNS server.
However, you have to implement at least one secondary DNS server to
provide redundancy. How are those changes propagated to the secondary
DNS server(s)? If you guessed "via a zone
transfer," you're right!</P>

<P class="docText">It's important to make a distinction here. Resolving
a hostname is one thing. As an end user, you need that functionality
in order to access Internet resources. As an administrator, you want
your DNS servers to provide name resolution. Otherwise, you have to
listen to a lot of unhappy end users.</P>

<P class="docText">However, your end users do not need to know the entire contents of
your DNS database. The world at large certainly
doesn't need to know the name and IP address of
every host in your network. Think about that one for a moment. You
probably have machines right now called <TT>finance</TT>,
<TT>hr</TT>, <TT>patents</TT>,
<TT>store</TT>, or <TT>admin</TT>. What tasty
names those are to fire the imaginations of a malicious user!</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-SECT-7.2.1"></A>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">5.7.2.1 The two-pronged approach</H5>

<P class="docText">You can use a two-pronged approach to prevent your DNS servers from
leaking information you'd rather not have the world
see. The first approach is called <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2435"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2436"></A>
<I>split DNS</I>. Run
your full DNS zone within your internal network, and run a very small
subset of that zone in your DMZ. That small subset is all the world
sees. If you think about it for a moment, which records does the
world need to know about? Probably just the record for your DNS
server (the one in the DMZ, with its secondary preferably hosted at
your ISP or somewhere else), the record for your web server, and the
record for your SMTP server. Those are the only records that this
mini-zone should contain.</P>

<P class="docText">The second approach is to control zone transfers tightly. The last
thing you want to happen is for the DNS server in the DMZ to ask for
a copy of your full internal zone. For that matter, you also
don't want a user on the Internet to ask your
internal DNS server for all of the records in your network.</P>

<P class="docText">There are multiple ways to control zone transfers, and you should
implement all of them. First, read the documentation for your DNS
server to see how to restrict the IP addresses that are allowed to
ask for zone transfers. (The "Securing an Internet
Name Server" link in this hack's
<A class="docLink" HREF="#bsdhks-CHP-5-SECT-7.3">Section 5.7.3</A> section explains how
to do this for BIND.)</P>

<P class="docText">Second, configure your
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2437"></A>
firewalls to control zone
transfers. DNS is an interesting protocol, as it uses port 53 with
both TCP and UDP. Your firewalls <span class="docEmphasis">must</span> allow UDP
53; if you deny this, all name resolution will stop. That is a bad
thing. However, TCP 53 is used for zone transfers. You must carefully
construct a firewall rule that allows TCP 53 only for the specific IP
addresses of the DNS servers that need to participate in a zone
transfer. Remember, you <span class="docEmphasis">do</span> want to transfer
changes to your secondary servers.</P>

<P class="docText">Third, create guidelines to test your
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2438"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2439"></A>
DNS servers periodically. Notice how
complex it was to secure those nameservers. How many things could go
wrong? Perhaps an OS patch or a DNS server application patch will
introduce a new hole. Perhaps a change in a firewall rulebase will
unwittingly reallow zone transfers. You're dealing
with multiple DNS servers—probably in multiple
locations—and multiple firewalls, which only increases the
possibility of error. A routine testing schedule increases the chance
of catching those errors before they remain for very long.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">5.7.2.2 Testing DNS</H5>

<P class="docText">You can use the <TT>axfr</TT> switch with
<TT>dig</TT> to test your DNS servers, but I prefer the
output provided by <TT>host -al</TT>. When you run this
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2440"></A>

<P class="docText">Remember, <TT>host -al</TT> asks for a zone transfer. You
<span class="docEmphasis">want</span> your DNS servers to refuse this request. In
this example, all four DNS servers received the request, so I know
they are up and working. The <TT>host</TT> utility then
requested a zone transfer from each server. Note the order: the first
IP address is for the first listed nameserver, and so on. This is
important, especially if one of those nameservers responds with a
zone transfer. I can't count the number of times
I've tested DNS servers and two out of three will
refuse the query, but one will allow the zone transfer.
You'll know which DNS server was the culprit if you
make note of the server response order.</P>
