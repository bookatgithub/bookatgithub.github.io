<P class="docText">Contrary
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2448"></A>
to
popular belief, you don't have to go to the trouble
of configuring an email client just because you want to check your
email or send off a quick email message.</P>

<P class="docText">Normally when you use the <TT>telnet</TT> application, you
use a Telnet client to attach to a Telnet server listening on port
23. Once you're connected, you can log in and do
anything on that device as if you were physically there, typing at
its keyboard.</P>

<P class="docText">The Telnet client has even more powerful capabilities than this. If
you specify a port number with the <TT>telnet</TT> command,
you will attach directly to the TCP server listening on that port. If
you know which commands that server can respond to, and if the
service understands plain text commands, you can talk directly to
that server. This essentially means that you no longer require a
client application specific to that server.</P>

<P class="docText">Let's pick apart that output. Note the
<TT>25</TT> at the end of the <TT>telnet</TT>
command. If you forget the port number, your prompt will probably
hang. This is because instead of trying to connect to the SMTP
service, you're trying to receive a login prompt
from your ISP's mail server. If you actually do
receive a login prompt, it is time to switch ISPs, as security is
obviously not one of their concerns!</P>

<P class="docText">Next, the output indicates when you successfully connect to the SMTP
service. Notice that there are very few secrets in TCP/IP-land. The
SMTP server readily shows its banner, which indicates the type of
SMTP application running on that server, its version and patch level,
as well as the time and date you connected. We'll
talk more about banners later.</P>

<P class="docText">After connecting to the server, I issued two SMTP commands:
<TT>MAIL FROM</TT> and <TT>RCPT TO</TT>. Some
SMTP servers are pickier than others and won't
recognize these commands unless you say hello first. If your SMTP
server complains about your lack of politeness, try typing
<TT>HELO</TT> or <TT>EHLO</TT>. I know that this
SMTP server accepted my commands because the responses start with
<TT>2xx</TT> and end with <TT>Ok</TT>. Responses
that begin with <TT>5xx</TT> indicate errors—you
either made a typo or used the wrong command. Most SMTP servers try
to be helpful by giving the syntax of the command they expect to
receive.</P>

<P class="docText">After providing the sender and recipient email addresses, I issued
the <TT>DATA</TT> command and pressed Enter. The SMTP
server then asked me to type my message. To indicate I was finished,
I put a dot (.) on a line by itself. The server
responded with a message number, and I ended the session by typing
<TT>QUIT</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Some interesting things happen if I play a bit with the SMTP
commands. For example, the <TT>MAIL FROM</TT> command does
not verify that the given email address is valid. This has some
interesting ramifications, as I could pretend to be
<span class="docEmphasis">santa@northpole.com</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">satan@hell.org</span>, or any other address my
imagination could dream up. Remember this quirk when you read your
email. There is no guarantee that any given email was actually sent
from the email address it purports to be from.</P>

<P class="docText">Additionally, I'll have mixed results if I start
playing with the <TT>RCPT TO</TT> address. I might start
receiving error messages like this:</P>

relaying is considered to be a bad

<P class="docText">Since you're supposed to connect to the correct SMTP
server in order to send email, how can you find out the name of a

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.8.2 Testing for Relaying</H4>

<P class="docText">As mentioned before, relaying is considered harmful because it allows
spammers to use another company's SMTP server to
relay spam. If you're responsible for an SMTP
server, be sure to read your SMTP documentation to see whether
relaying is off by default and how to turn it off if it
isn't. You can then initiate a quick
<TT>telnet</TT> session to port 25 to ensure your SMTP
server does indeed refuse to relay email. For example, I
don't want the <span class="docEmphasis">mycompany.com</span>
SMTP server to respond like this:</P>

<PRE><B>rcpt to:&lt;beastie@unix.ca&gt;</B>
250 Recipient &lt;beastie@unix.ca&gt; Ok</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If it does, it is willing to relay to the
<span class="docEmphasis">unix.ca</span> SMTP server.</P>

<P class="docText">What else should you look for when you <TT>telnet</TT> to
your own SMTP server? Take a careful look at your banner. Does it
freely advertise that you're one or two patch levels
behind? Do you really want to tell anyone who knows enough to ask
which particular SMTP product you're using? If they
know enough to use <TT>telnet</TT>, they probably know how
to use Google to look for known vulnerabilities in that product.
It's always good to know exactly what the world
sees. You can then determine if you prefer to change the banner to
something a little less chatty. Read the documentation for your
particular product to see how to do so.</P>

is an invaluable troubleshooting tool. For
example, if users complain that they can no longer access the mail

<TT>ping</TT>ing the mail server. If the mail server
responds, you can <TT>telnet</TT> to its SMTP port to
verify that the SMTP service is still running.</P>

<P class="docText">Notice that you use port 110 to connect to a POP3 server. Also, the
commands used by POP3 are very different than those understood by
SMTP. In this session, I used the <TT>USER</TT> command to
indicate my username and the <TT>PASS</TT> command for my
password. Unlike SMTP, you do have to authenticate to use POP3.</P>

<P class="docText">Once I successfully authenticated, I used the <TT>LIST</TT>
command to see how many email messages were waiting for me. I had one
message, which was 544 bytes long. I then used the
<TT>RETR</TT> command to display that message, including
the headers as well as its contents, and typed the
<TT>QUIT</TT> command to end the POP3 session.</P>

<P class="docText">There are several things you should be aware of regarding the POP3
protocol. The first is that every single packet—including those
containing your username, password, and the contents of each email
message—are sent in clear text. That means that a
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2467"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2468"></A>
packet sniffer running on your network
would have full access to that information.</P>

<P class="docText">Second, anyone who knows your email password could conceivably
connect to your POP3 server and read your email. Worse, they could
use the <TT>DELE</TT> command to delete your email before
you had a chance to receive it.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.8.5 Security Considerations</H4>

<P class="docText">That <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2469"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-5-ITERM-2470"></A>
doesn't sound
very good, does it? There are several things you can do as an
end-user to protect your email. One is to use a third-party email
encryption product, which will protect the contents of your email
(but not your username and password) from packet sniffers. The other
is to use different passwords for different functions. For example,
don't use the same password to pick up email, do
online banking, log into your office network, etc. And always pick a
password that your friends and family won't be able
to guess.</P>

<P class="docText">As an email administrator, you can also create a safer environment
for your users. Create a different username for each user, something
other than the names contained within their email addresses. For
example: <span class="docEmphasis">moi@mycompany.com</span> usually indicates a
username of <TT>moi</TT>. That means I could connect to the
POP3 server at <span class="docEmphasis">mycompany.com</span> and try to guess
the password for the user <TT>moi</TT>. However, if the
administrator had given that user a username such as
<TT>l2tn4g</TT> and instructed that user never to give out
his username, it would be much more difficult for someone else to
access his email.</P>
