the typical day in the life of a system
administrator. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to
achieve the impossible. Today, you're expected to:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Increase the security of a particular server</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Attain a noticeable improvement in speed and performance</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Although there are many ways to go about this, the most efficient way
is to strip down the kernel to its bare-bones essentials. Having this
ability gives an administrator of an open source system a distinct
advantage over his closed source counterparts.</P>

<P class="docText">The first advantage to stripping the kernel is an obvious security
boost. A vulnerability can't affect an option the
kernel doesn't support. The second is a noticeable
improvement in speed and performance. Kernels are loaded into memory
and must stay in memory. You may be wasting precious memory resources
if you're loading options you have no intention of
ever using.</P>

<P class="docText">If you've never compiled a kernel or changed more
than one or two kernel options, I can hear you groaning now.
You're probably thinking, "Anything
but that. Kernels are too complicated to
understand." Well, there is a lot of truth in the
idea that you haven't really used an operating
system until you've gone through that baptism of
fire known as kernel compiling. However, you may not have heard that
compiling a kernel isn't all that difficult. So,
grab a spare afternoon and a test system; it's high
time to learn how to hack a BSD kernel.</P>

<P class="docText">I'll demonstrate on a FreeBSD system, but
you'll find resources for other systems at the end
of this hack.</P>

<P class="docText">Before you start, double-check that you have the kernel source
installed. On an Intel FreeBSD system, it lives in
<I>/usr/src/sys/i386/conf</I>. If that directory
doesn't exist, become the superuser and install it:</P>

<PRE># <B>/stand/sysinstall</B>
Configure
Distributions
spacebar [  ] src to select it
spacebar [  ] sys to select it
tab to OK</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Next, navigate into that directory structure and check out its
contents:</P>

<PRE># <B>cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf</B>
# <B>ls</B>
 ./        GENERIC.hints    OLDCARD        gethints.awk
../        Makefile         PAE            GENERIC
NOTES      SMP</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Two files are important: the original kernel configuration file,
<I>GENERIC</I>, and <I>NOTES</I>. Note
that <I>NOTES</I> is instead called
<I>LINT</I> on 4.x FreeBSD systems.</P>

kernel is a very systematic process.
Basically, you examine each line in the current configuration file,
asking yourself, "Is this applicable to my
situation?" If so, keep it. Otherwise, remove it. If
you don't know, read <I>NOTES</I> for
that option.</P>

<P class="docText">I always customize my kernel in several steps. First, I strip out
what I don't need. Then, I use
<TT>buildkernel</TT> to test my new configuration file. If
it doesn't build successfully, I know
I've inadvertently removed something essential.
Using the error message, I go back and research that missing line.</P>

<P class="docText">If the build succeeds, I read through <I>NOTES</I> to
see if there are any options I wish to add to the kernel. If I add
anything, I'll do another
<TT>buildkernel</TT>, followed by an
<TT>installkernel</TT> if the build is successful. I find
it much easier to troubleshoot if I separate my deletions from my
additions.</P>

<PRE># <B>grep CPU NOTES</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Your output will include a few pages worth of CPU information. The
first few lines describe which CPUs belong with the I486, I586, and
I686 entries. Once you find your CPU, remove the two entries that

<P class="docText">The rest of the output from <TT>grep CPU NOTES</TT>
contains extra lines that can be added to the kernel. Read through
these to see if any apply to your specific CPU and the needs of the

<P class="docText">The <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2556"></A>
next section contains a heck
of a lot of options. If this is your first kernel, most of your
research will be deciding which options you need for your particular
system. I find the handbook most helpful here, as it lists the pros
and cons of nearly every option. I always keep these options on all
of my systems:</P>

<PRE>options     SCHED_4BSD       # 4BSD scheduler
options     INET             # InterNETworking
options     FFS              # Berkeley Fast Filesystem
options     COMPAT_FREEBSD4  # Compatible with FreeBSD4
options     COMPAT_43        # Compatible with BSD 4.3 [KEEP THIS!]</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that that last listed option tells you to keep it. Do keep
anything that contains such a comment.</P>

<P class="docText">The rest of the options are specific to that
system's needs. For example, does it need to support
IPv6? Do you wish to use softupdates or the new MAC framework? Does
this system need to be an NFS server or NFS client? Does this system
have a CD-ROM attached or any SCSI devices?</P>

<P class="docText">Does the system have multiple processors? If so, uncomment the next
two lines; otherwise, you can safely remove them:</P>

system doesn't use the <TT>isa</TT> or
<TT>eisa</TT> buses, you can remove those lines.</P>

<P class="docText">Remember, you can remove the CD-ROM, floppy, and tape lines to suit
your requirements. However, keep the other lines if you use an IDE
hard drive. Conversely, if your system is all SCSI, delete the ATA
lines and concentrate on this section:</P>

<P class="docText">Whew. We finally made it through the configuration file.
Congratulations! You now have a much better idea of the hardware on
your system and can rest easily in the knowledge that soon no extra
drivers will be wasting memory resources. Not only that, your next
kernel configuration will go much more quickly as
you've already researched the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2573"></A>

<P class="docText">Now <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2576"></A>
comes the moment of truth. Will the
configuration file actually build? To find out:</P>

<PRE># <B>cd /usr/src</B>
# <B>make buildkernel KERNCONF=</B>
<span class="docEmphBoldItalic">STRIPPED</span></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Replace <TT><I>STRIPPED</I></TT> with whatever name you
called your kernel configuration file. If all goes well, you should
just get your prompt back after a period of time, which varies
depending upon the speed of your CPU. If you instead get an error
message, you probably <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2577"></A>
forgot
<TT>miibus</TT>, <TT>scbus</TT>, or
<TT>da</TT>, and the message will reflect that. Add the
missing line and try again.</P>

<P class="docText">Occasionally you'll get a kernel that just refuses
to build, even when you're sure the configuration
file is fine. If that's the case, try building
<TT>GENERIC</TT>. If that fails, you have a hardware issue.</P>

<P class="docText">I once inherited a system with a flaky motherboard. I tried a few
kernel compiles, which took forever before finally resulting in an
<TT>error code 1</TT>. Fortunately, I use removable drives,
so I simply inserted the drive into another system, successfully
compiled the kernel, and then returned the drive to the flaky system
for the actual kernel install.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.2.3 Keeping Track of Your Options</H4>

<P class="docText">Once I have a successful build, I like to document what I removed
from the original kernel. This is easily done:</P>

<PRE># <B>echo "These are the lines I deleted" &gt; changes.txt \</B>
    <B>&amp; diff GENERIC STRIPPED &gt;&gt; changes.txt</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <TT>diff</TT> utility will list the differences between
the original and my version of the kernel configuration file. Note
that I used <TT>&gt;&gt;</TT> to append those differences
without removing my previously <TT>echo</TT>ed comment. See
 <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-9-SECT-5.html#bsdhks-CHP-9-SECT-5"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #92]</span></A>  for more examples that
use <TT>diff</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Before installing the kernel, read through <I>NOTES</I>
to see if there are any lines you wish to add. Additionally, if you
wish to take advantage of memory addresses over 4 GB, carefully read
through <I>PAE</I> and its section in the handbook to
see if it is appropriate for your situation.</P>

<P class="docText">If you add any lines, repeat the <TT>make buildkernel</TT>
command when you are finished. I also like to append my additions to
my <I>changes.txt</I> file:</P>

<PRE># <B>echo "And these are the lines I added" &gt;&gt; changes.txt \</B>
    <B>&amp; diff GENERIC STRIPPED &gt;&gt; changes.txt</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that this time it is very important I remember to append both my
comment and the output of <TT>diff</TT> by using two
<TT>&gt;</TT> characters.</P>

kernel:</P>

<P class="docText">This process is much quicker than building the kernel. However, the
kernel won't actually be loaded into memory until
you reboot. Before you do that, it's always a good
idea to print out the "If Something Goes
Wrong" page of the FreeBSD Handbook, just in case
something goes wrong. See <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig-trouble.html#KERNELCONFIG-NOBOOT">http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig-trouble.html#KERNELCONFIG-NOBOOT</A>.</P>
