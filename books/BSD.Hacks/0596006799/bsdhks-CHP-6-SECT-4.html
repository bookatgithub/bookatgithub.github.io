<P class="docText">Any user can use any flag that starts with <TT>u</TT> to
protect her own files. Let's say you have an
important file that you don't want to change
inadvertently. That's a candidate for the
<TT>uchg</TT> flag. To turn that flag on, use <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2615"></A>
the <TT>chflags</TT> (change
flags) command:</P>

<PRE>% <B>chflags uchg important_file</B>
% <B>ls -lo important_file</B>
-rw-r--r-- 1 dru wheel uchg 14 Dec  1 11:13 important_file</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Use <TT>ls -lo</TT> to view a file's
flags. (I tend to think <TT>o</TT> was the only letter
left. Perhaps a mnemonic would be "Hello,
<span class="docEmphasis">this</span> is why I can't modify that
file!" Perhaps not.) Let's see
exactly how immutable this file is now. I'll start
by opening the file in <TT>vi</TT>, adding a line, and
trying to save my changes:</P>

<PRE>Read-only file, not written; use ! to override.</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Okay, I'll use <TT>wq!</TT> instead:</P>

<PRE>Error: important_file: Operation not permitted.</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Looks like I can no longer make changes to my own file.
I'll receive the same results even if I try as the
superuser.</P>

<P class="docText">Next, I'll try to use <TT>echo</TT> to add
some lines to that file:</P>

<PRE>% <B>echo "test string" &gt;&gt; important_file</B>
important_file: Operation not permitted.</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Finally, I'll try moving, deleting, and copying that
file:</P>

<PRE>% <B>mv important_file test</B>
mv: rename important_file to test: Operation not permitted

% <B>rm important_file</B>
override rw-r--r--  dru/wheel uchg for important_file? <B>y</B>
rm: important_file: Operation not permitted

<P class="docText">Notice an important difference between the <TT>mv</TT> and

 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2617"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2618"></A>
commands and the
<TT>cp</TT> command. Since <TT>mv</TT> and
<TT>rm</TT> require a change to the original file itself,
they are prevented by that unchangeable flag. However, the
<TT>cp</TT> command doesn't try to change
the original file; it simply creates a new file with the same
contents. However, if you try <TT>ls -lo</TT> on that new
file, the <TT>uchg</TT> flag will <span class="docEmphasis">not</span>
be set. This is because new files inherit permissions and flags from
the parent directory. (Okay, that's not the whole
story. See <TT>man umask</TT> for more gory details.)</P>

<P class="docText">So far so good. That file inherited the <TT>uchg</TT> flag

that's what you want, great. If not, keep that in
mind when playing with directory flags.</P>

<P class="docText">What if you change your mind and really do want to change a file? If
you own the file, you can unset the <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2620"></A>
flag by repeating the
<TT>chflags</TT> command with the <TT>no</TT>
word. For example:</P>

<PRE>% <B>chflags nouchg resume</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">will allow me to make edits to my r&eacute;sum&eacute;.
However, I won't be able to delete it from that

<P class="docText">Sometimes, <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2621"></A>
the <TT>uchg</TT> flag is a
bit too drastic. For example, if you want to be able to edit a file
but not inadvertently delete that file, use this
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2622"></A>
flag instead:</P>

<PRE>% <B>chflags uunlnk thesis</B>

<P class="docText">I can now edit that file to my heart's content.
However, if I try to move or delete that file, I'll
receive those <TT>Operation not permitted</TT> error
messages again.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>uappnd</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2623"></A>
flag is more interesting. It allows you to
append changes to a
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2624"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2625"></A>
file but prevents you from modifying the
existing contents. This might be useful for a blog:</P>

<PRE>% <B>chflags uappnd myblog</B>
%</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Then again, it might not. <TT>echo</TT>ing comments to the
end of the file works nicely. However, opening it in an editor does
not. Note that this flag also prevents you from moving or deleting
the file.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.4.4 Log Protection</H4>

<P class="docText">Let's move on to the rest of the flags, which can be

 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2631"></A>
work exactly the same as their
<TT>u</TT> equivalents. So, think <TT>s</TT> for
superuser and <TT>u</TT> for user.</P>

<P class="docText">The append flag was a bit weird for a regular user, but it is ideal
for protecting the system logs. One of the first things an intruder
will do after breaking into a system is to cover up his tracks by
changing or deleting logs. This command will thwart those attempts:</P>

<PRE># <B>chflags -R sappnd /var/log</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Now is a good time to mention a security truth: security is a myth.
In reality, security is a process of making things more inconvenient
in the hopes that a miscreant will go elsewhere. Remember, though,
that inconvenience doesn't just affect the bad guys;
it also affects you.</P>

<P class="docText">That command seems ideal because it allows logs to be appended to but
not modified or deleted. That's great if you live in
the world of unlimited disk space. Of course, it also just broke
<TT>newsyslog</TT>, and you've just
delegated yourself the joys of manual log rotation.</P>

<P class="docText">There's one other thing you need to consider when
you start playing with the superuser flags. If your
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2632"></A>
securelevel is set to 0 or -1, the superuser
can unset any flag by adding <TT>no</TT> to it. If your
attacker has heard of flags before and has managed to gain access to
the superuser account, all of your flag setting was for <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2633"></A>
naught.</P>

<P class="docText">Having said that, suppose you're hardening a server
and want to protect the logs. Your securelevel is set at 1 or higher,
and you plan on using that previous <TT>chflags</TT>
command. Since you're now responsible for log
rotation, you might as well start by taking stock of the contents of
<I>/var/log</I><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2634"></A>
 before turning on that
<TT>sappnd</TT> flag. Remove any unnecessary logs now,
before setting the flag.</P>

<P class="docText">Next, edit <I>/etc/crontab</I> and
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2635"></A>
comment
the <TT>newsyslog</TT> line so it looks like this:</P>

<PRE># Rotate log files every hour, if necessary.
#0        *        *        *        *        root        newsyslog</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Comment out any lines in <I>/etc/syslog.conf</I> that
refer to logs you removed.</P>

<P class="docText">You should also consider using something like the following script to
warn you if a <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2636"></A>
partition is <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2637"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2638"></A>
filling up:</P>

<PRE>#!usr/local/bin/bash
# checkfreespace.sh
# check that a device has sufficient free space
# thanks to David Lents and Arnold Robbins for awk/gawk/nawk suggestions

USED=$(
    eval "df | awk -- '\$6 =  = ENVIRON[\"PARTITION\"]
        { printf( \"%0.d\", \$5 ) }'"
);

if [ "$USED" -ge $THRESHOLD ]
then
  echo "Used space of $USED above $THRESHOLD on $PARTITION"
else
  # disable this if running through cron
  echo "Enough free space"
fi</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you schedule this program through <TT>cron</TT>, it will
mail any output to the user owning the <TT>cron</TT> job.
Edit the two variables at the top of the script to change the
partition to scan and the threshold above which the script will warn.
With the variables set as shown, the script will warn if
<I>/var/log</I> is more than 80% full.</P>

<P class="docText">Remember, once you disable <TT>newsyslog</TT>, it becomes
your responsibility to monitor disk space in
<I>/var/log</I>. You won't be able to
compress or delete log files unless the superuser temporarily unsets
the <TT>sappnd</TT> flag. This can be a real pain if your
securelevel is 1 or higher, as the system first has to be dropped
down to single-user mode. This usually isn't an
option on busy systems as it will disconnect all current connections.
Carefully consider the size of <I>/var/log</I> and how
often the system realistically can be put into single-user mode
before setting this <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2639"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2640"></A>

a
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2643"></A>
system is compromised, the attacker may
install a rootkit that will try to change your
system's binaries. For example, it might replace
<TT>ps</TT> with a version that doesn't
display the rootkit's processes. Or, it might
replace a commonly used utility with another program that executes
something nastier than expected.</P>

<P class="docText"> <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-6.html#bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-6"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #58]</span></A>  shows how to create
your own file integrity checking program that will alert you if any
of your binaries or other important files are changed. An additional
layer of protection is to use <TT>chflags</TT> to prevent
those files from being changed in the first place. Usually, the
<TT>schg</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2644"></A>
flag is used to prevent any modifications.
Useful candidates for this flag are:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList"><I>/usr/bin</I>, which contains user programs</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/usr/sbin</I>, which contains system programs</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/etc</I>, which contains system configurations</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Again, evaluate your particular scenario before implementing this
flag. The protection provided by this flag usually far outweighs the
inconvenience. The only time the contents of
<I>/usr/bin</I> or <I>/usr/sbin</I>
should change is when you upgrade the operating system or rebuild
your world. Doing that requires a reboot anyway, so dropping to
single-user mode to unset <TT>schg</TT>
shouldn't be a problem.</P>

<P class="docText">How often do you change your configuration files in
<I>/etc</I>? If you typically configure a system only
when it is installed and rarely make changes afterward, protect your
configurations with <TT>schg</TT>. However, keep in mind
that a rare configuration change may require you to drop all
connections in order to implement it. Also, if you need to add more
users to your system, remember to remove that flag from
<I>/etc/passwd</I>,
<I>/etc/master.passwd</I>, and
<I>/etc/group</I> first.</P>

<P class="docText">Things are a bit more problematic for a system running installed
applications. Most ports install their binaries into
<I>/usr/local/bin</I> or
<I>/usr/X11R6/bin</I>. If you set the
<TT>schg</TT> flag on those directories, you
won't be able to patch or upgrade those binaries
unless you temporarily unset the flag. You'll have
to balance your need to keep your server up and running with the
protection you gain from the <TT>schg</TT> flag and how
often you have to patch a particular binary.</P>
