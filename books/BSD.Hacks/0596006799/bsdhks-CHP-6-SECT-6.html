<P class="docText">The specification starts with a nice summary section. In my example,
the user that created the specification was <TT>dru</TT>.
Note that I used the <TT>su</TT> utility to become the
superuser before creating the specification, but my login shell knew
that I was still logged in as the user <TT>dru</TT>. The
summary also shows the system name, <TT>genisis</TT>, the
directory structure in question, <I>/usr/bin</I>, and
the time the specification was created.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>/set type=file</TT> line shows the information
<TT>mtree</TT> records by default. Notice that it keeps
track of each file's uid, gid, mode, number of hard
links, and flags.</P>

<P class="docText">Then, each file and subdirectory in <I>/usr/bin</I> is
listed one at a time. Since I used <TT>-K</TT> to specify
three different cryptographic hashes, each file has three separate

different medium (such as a floppy), and place it in a secure storage
area.</P>

<P class="docText">To sign the file:</P>

<P class="docText">You may wish to redirect that resulting fingerprint to a file or a

<P class="docText">Next, encrypt the file. Remember, right now it is in ASCII text and
susceptible to tampering. Here I'll encrypt the file
and send the newly encrypted file to the floppy mounted at

fairly straightforward. I decided to encrypt <TT>enc
-e</TT> with the Blowfish <TT>-bf</TT> algorithm. I
then specified the input file, or the file to be encrypted. I also
specified the output file, or the resulting encrypted file. I was
then prompted for a password; this same password will be required
whenever I need to decrypt the database.</P>

<P class="docText">Once I verify that the encrypted file is indeed on the floppy, I must

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.6.3 Using the Integrity Database</H4>

<P class="docText">Once <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2682"></A>
you
have an integrity database, you'll want to compare
it periodically to the files on your hard drive. Mount the media
containing your encrypted database, and then decrypt it:</P>

<PRE># <B>openssl enc -d -bf -in /floppy/mtree_bin_enc -out /tmp/mtree_bin</B>
enter bf-cbc encryption password:</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Notice that I used basically the same command I used to encrypt it. I
simply replaced the encrypt switch (<TT>-e</TT>) with the
decrypt switch (<TT>-d</TT>). The encrypted file is now the
input, and the plain text file is now the output. Note that I was
prompted for the same password; if I forget it, the decryption will
fail.</P>

<P class="docText">Before using that database, I first want to verify that its
fingerprint hasn't been tampered with. Again, I
simply repeat the <TT>md5</TT> command. If the resulting
fingerprint is the same, the database is unmodified:</P>

<PRE># <B>md5 /tmp/mtree_bin</B>
MD5 (/tmp/mtree_bin) = e05bab7545f7bdbce13e1bb04a043e47</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Next, I'll see if any of my files have been tampered

<P class="docText">If none of the files have changed in <I>/usr/bin</I>,
the checksum will be the same. In this case it was. See why it was
important to record that seed and checksum?</P>

<P class="docText">What happens if a file does change? I haven't built
world on this system in a while, so I suspect I have source files
that haven't made their way into
<I>/usr/bin</I> yet. After some poking about, I notice
that <I>/usr/src/usr.bin</I> has a
<I>bluetooth</I> directory containing the source for a

mtree: /usr/bin checksum: 417306521</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Well, it didn't fool <TT>mtree</TT>. That
output is actually quite useful. I know that
<TT>btsockstat</TT> was added as an
<TT>extra</TT> file, and I know the date and time it was
added. Since I added that file myself, it is an easy matter to
resolve. If I hadn't and needed to investigate, I
have a time to assist me in my research. I could talk to the
administrator who was responsible at that date and time, or I could
see if there were any network connections logged during that time
period.</P>

<P class="docText">Also note that this addition resulted in a new checksum. Once the
changes have been resolved, I should create a new database that

<P class="docText">When you create your own <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2683"></A>
integrity database, ask yourself,
"Which files do I want to be aware of if they
change?" The answer is usually your binaries or
applications. Here is a list of common binary locations on a FreeBSD
system:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList"><I>/bin</I></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/sbin</I></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/usr/bin</I></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/usr/sbin</I></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/usr/local/bin</I></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/usr/X11R6/bin</I></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/usr/compat/linux/bin</I></P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><I>/usr/compat/linux/sbin</I></P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">The <I>sbin</I> directories are especially important
because they contain system binaries. Most ports will install to
<I>/usr/local/bin</I> or
<I>/usr/X11R6/bin</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">The second question to ask yourself is "How often
should I check the database?" The answer will depend
upon your circumstances. If the machine is a publicly accessible
server, you might consider this as part of your daily maintenance
plan. If the system's software tends to change
often, you'll also want to check often, while you
can still remember when you installed <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2684"></A>
