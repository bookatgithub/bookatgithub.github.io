<P class="docText">People <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2722"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2723"></A>
often store sensitive information on their
hard disks and have concerns about this information falling into the
wrong hands. This is particularly relevant to users of <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2724"></A>
laptops and other portable devices,
which might be stolen or accidentally misplaced.</P>

<P class="docText">File-oriented encryption tools like GnuPG are great for encrypting
particular files that will be sent across untrusted networks or
stored on disk. But sometimes these tools are inconvenient, because
the file must be decrypted each time it is to be used; this is
especially cumbersome when you have a large collection of files to
protect. Any time a security tool is cumbersome to use,
there's a chance you'll forget to
use it properly, leaving the files unprotected for the sake of
convenience.</P>

<P class="docText">Worse, readable copies of the encrypted contents might still exist on
the hard disk. Even if you overwrite these files (using <TT>rm
-P</TT>) before unlinking them, your application software might
make temporary copies that you don't know about or
that have been paged to swapspace. Even your hard disk might have
silently remapped failing sectors with data still in them.</P>

<P class="docText">The solution is simply never to write the information unencrypted to
the hard disk. Rather than taking a file-oriented approach to
encryption, consider a block-oriented approach—a virtual hard
disk that looks just like a normal hard disk with normal filesystems,
but which encrypts and decrypts each block on the way to and from the
real disk.</P>

<P class="docText">NetBSD includes the encrypting block device driver
<TT>cgd(4)</TT> to help you accomplish this task; the other
BSDs have similar virtual devices that, with somewhat different
commands, can achieve the same thing. This hack concentrates on
NetBSD's <TT>cgd</TT>.</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2727"></A>
<TT>cgd(4)</TT> device looks
and behaves like any other disk driver. Rather than driving real
hardware directly, it provides a logical function layered on top of
another block device. It has a special configuration program,
<TT>cgdconfig</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2728"></A>
, to create and configure a
<TT>cgd</TT> device and point it at the underlying disk
device that will hold the encrypted data. You can stack several
logical block devices together; <TT>cgd(4)</TT> on top of
<TT>vnd(4)</TT> is handy for making an encrypted volume in
a regular file without repartitioning, or you can make an encrypted
<TT>raid(4)</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Once you have a <TT>cgd</TT> configured, you can put a
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2729"></A>
<TT>disklabel</TT> on it to
divide it up into partitions, make filesystems or enable swapping to
those partitions, or <TT>mount</TT> and use those
filesystems, just like any other new disk.</P>

<P class="docText">Roland C. <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2730"></A>
Dowdeswell wrote the <TT>cgd</TT>
driver. It first appeared in NetBSD-current after the 1.6 release
branch. As a result, it is not in the 1.6 release series; it will be
in the 2.0 release and, in the meantime, many people are using it
with -current.</P>

<P class="docText">In order to use <TT>cgd</TT>, ensure that you have the line:</P>

<PRE>pseudo-device            cgd    4    # cryptographic disk devices</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">in your kernel configuration file; otherwise, build and install a new
kernel. You'll also need a running system, as the
NetBSD installer currently doesn't support
installing new systems directly into a <TT>cgd</TT>.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-8.2"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.8.2 Preparing the Disk</H4>

<P class="docText">First, <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2731"></A>
decide which filesystems you
want to move to an encrypted device. You need to leave at least the
small root filesystem (at <I>/</I>) unencrypted in
order to load the kernel and run <TT>init</TT>,
<TT>cgdconfig</TT>, and the <TT>rc.d</TT> scripts
that configure your <TT>cgd</TT>. In this example,
we'll encrypt everything except
<I>/</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">We are going to delete and remake partitions and filesystems, and
will require a backup to restore the data. So, make sure you have a
current, reliable backup stored on a different disk or machine. Do
your backup in single-user mode, with the filesystems unmounted, to
ensure you get a clean <TT>dump</TT>. Make sure you back up
the disklabel of your hard disk as well, so you have a record of the
original partition layout.</P>

<P class="docText">With the system in single-user mode, <I>/</I> mounted
as read-write, and everything else unmounted, delete all the data
partitions you want to move into <TT>cgd</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Then, make a single new partition in all the space you just freed up,
say, <TT>wd0e</TT>. Set the type for this partition to
<TT>ccd</TT>. (There's no code
specifically for <TT>cgd</TT>, but <TT>ccd</TT>
is very similar. Though it doesn't really matter
what it is, it will help remind you that it's not a
normal filesystem.) When finished, label the disk to save the new
partition table.</P>

<P class="docText">We've <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2732"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2733"></A>
removed
the partition table information, but the existing filesystems and
data are still on disk. Even after we make a <TT>cgd</TT>
device, create filesystems, and restore our data, some of these disk
blocks might not yet be overwritten and might still contain our data
in plain text. This is especially likely if the filesystems are
mostly empty. We want to scrub the disk before we go further.</P>

<P class="docText">We could use <TT>dd</TT> to write
<I>/dev/zero</I> over the new <TT>wd0e</TT>
partition, but this will leave our disk full of zeros, except where
we later write encrypted data. We might not want to give an attacker
any clues about which blocks contain real data and which are free
space, so we want to write noise into all the disk blocks.
We'll create a temporary <TT>cgd</TT>,
configured with a random, unknown key.</P>

<P class="docText">First, we make a parameters file to tell <TT>cgd</TT> to
use a random key:</P>

<PRE># <B>cgdconfig -g -k randomkey -o /tmp/wd0e-rnd aes-cbc</B></PRE><BR>

which manipulates
<TT>cgd</TT> devices, uses parameters files to store such

salt for each <TT>cgd</TT>. These files are very important
and must be kept safe—without them, you will not be able to
decrypt the data!</P>

<P class="docText">We'll generate a parameters file and write it into
the default location (make sure the directory
<I>/etc/cgd</I> exists and is mode 600):</P>

<PRE># <B>cgdconfig -g -V disklabel -o /etc/cgd/wd0e aes-cbc 256</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This creates a parameters file describing a <TT>cgd</TT>

you'll want to save this file somewhere safe later.</P>

<P class="docText">Now it's time to create our <TT>cgd</TT>,
for which we'll need a
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2736"></A>
passphrase. This
passphrase must be entered every time the <TT>cgd</TT> is
opened, usually at each reboot, and it is from this passphrase that
the encryption key used is derived. Make sure you choose something
you won't forget and others won't

<P class="docText">The first time we create the <TT>cgd</TT>, there is no

<TT>disklabel</TT>, because you're
creating an initial label for a new disk.</P>

<P class="docText">Then, use <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2737"></A>

accordingly. Each partition will have the same letter but will be on

<P class="docText">Note that <I>/tmp</I> should be a separate filesystem,

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Use two separate <TT>cgd</TT>s: one with a random key just

containing <TT>init</TT>, <TT>cgdconfig</TT>,
your parameters file, and any other required tools. Boot that image
from removable media (such as a USB flash device) that you carry

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.8.8 Final Thoughts and Warnings</H4>

<P class="docText">Prevent <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2742"></A>
cryptographic disasters by making
sure you can always recover your passphrase and parameters file.
Protect the parameters file from disclosure, perhaps by storing it on
removable media as just mentioned, because the salt it contains helps
protect against dictionary attacks on the passphrase.</P>

<P class="docText">Keeping the data encrypted on your disk is all very well, but what
about other copies? You already have at least one other such copy
(the backup we used during this setup), and it's not
encrypted. Piping <TT>dump</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2743"></A>
through a file-based encryption tool
such as <TT>gpg</TT> can be one way of addressing this
issue, but make sure you can decrypt it to restore after a disaster.</P>

<P class="docText">Like any form of software encryption, the <TT>cgd</TT> key
stays in kernel memory while the device is configured and may be
accessible to privileged programs and users, such as
<TT>kmem</TT> grovelers. Running your system with an
elevated <TT>securelevel</TT> is highly recommended.</P>

<P class="docText">Once the <TT>cgd</TT> volumes are mounted as normal
filesystems, their accessibility is just like any other file. Take
care of file permissions, and ensure that your running system is
protected against application and network security attacks.</P>

<P class="docText">Avoid using suspend and resume, especially for <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-6-ITERM-2744"></A>
laptops with a BIOS
suspend-to-disk function. If an attacker can resume your laptop with
the key still in memory or read it from the memory image on disk
later, the whole point of using <TT>cgd</TT> is lost.</P>
