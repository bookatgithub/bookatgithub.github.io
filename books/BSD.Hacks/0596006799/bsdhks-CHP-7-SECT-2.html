<P class="docText">As <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2874"></A>
an administrator, you want to tune your
server systems so they work at peak efficiency. How do you know what
to tune? The answer depends heavily upon the
system's function. Will the system perform a lot of
small network transactions? Will it perform a small number of large
transactions? How will disk operations factor in?</P>

<P class="docText">How you answer these and other questions determines what you need to
do to improve the performance of your systems. This hack starts with
general optimizations and then looks at function-specific tunables.</P>

good place to start is with software
compiling, as you want to compile software and updates as efficiently
as possible. Whenever you compile, your compiler makes assumptions
about your hardware in order to create binaries. If you have an
x86-compliant CPU, for example, your compiler will create binaries
that can run on any CPU from a 386 onward. While this allows
portability, it won't take advantage of any new
abilities of your CPU, such as the extended MMX, SSE, SSE2, or 3DNow!
instruction sets. This is also why using precompiled binaries on your
system is a surefire way to reduce your overall performance.</P>

<P class="docText">To ensure that software will be compiled efficiently, update your
compiler flags in
<I>/etc/make.conf</I><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2878"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2879"></A>
. This file
does not exist on new systems, but you can copy it from
<I>/usr/share/examples/etc/defaults/make.conf</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">Start by editing the <TT>CPUTYPE=</TT> line to reflect your
CPU type; you'll find supported types listed as
comments just before this line. While this will take advantage of
your CPU's features, the disadvantage is that your
compiled binaries may not run on different CPU types. However, if all
of your systems run the same CPU platform, any optimizations you make
to shared binaries will affect all of your systems equally well.</P>

<P class="docText">Next, change the <TT>CFLAGS</TT> line to <TT>CFLAGS=
-O2 -pipe -funroll-loops</TT>. The <TT>-pipe</TT>
option can significantly decrease the amount of time it takes to
compile software, by using pipes to communicate between compiler
processes instead of temporary files, but at the expense of using
slightly more memory. The <TT>-funroll-loops</TT> saves one
CPU register that would otherwise be tied up in tracking the
iteration of the loop, but at the expense of making a slightly larger
binary.</P>

modern network cards and

<P class="docText">Next, you can enable
<TT>DEVICE_POLLING</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2891"></A>
 in your kernel, which changes the method
by which data travels from your network card to the kernel. Without
this setting, frequent interrupt calls may never free the kernel.
This is known as
<I>livelock</I><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2892"></A>
 and can leave your machine
unresponsive. Those of us unfortunate enough to be on the wrong side
of certain denial-of-service attacks know about this.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>DEVICE_POLLING</TT> option causes the kernel to
poll the network card at certain predefined times, during idle loops,
or on clock interrupts. This allows the kernel to decide when it is
most efficient to poll a device for updates and for how long, and
ultimately results in a significant increase in performance.</P>

<P class="docText">To take advantage of <TT>DEVICE_POLLING</TT>, you need to
compile two options into your kernel: <TT>options
DEVICE_POLLING</TT> and <TT>options HZ=1000</TT>. The
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2893"></A>
latter option
slows the clock interrupts to 1,000 times per second, which prevents
the kernel from polling too often.</P>

<P class="docText">Once you've recompiled your kernel,
you'll still need to enable the feature. Add this

servers
typically have a very large number of network connections, during
which they transfer a small amount of data for a short period of time
before closing the connection. In this case, it is useful to have a
large number of small network buffers.</P>

<P class="docText">Network connections have two buffers, one for sending and one for
receiving. The size of the buffer dictates how quickly data will
funnel through the network and, in the event of a network delay, how
much data can back up the server for that connection before there is
a problem. Having a network buffer that is too small will cause a
data backlog as the CPU waits for the network to clear, which causes
greater CPU overhead. Having a network buffer that is too large
wastes memory by using the buffer inefficiently. Finding a balance is
the key to tuning.</P>

<P class="docText">I find that multiplying the number of
<span class="docEmphasis">established</span> connections by 32 leaves me with
room to breathe in the event that I see an abnormally high surge of
traffic. I've come to this number over time through
trial and error. So, if you expect to have a peak of 128 servers
sending you mail, having 8,192 network buffer clusters would be good
(128 2 per connection 32). Also, remember that connections can take
up to two full minutes or more to close completely. If you expect
more than 128 emails in any given two-minute period, increase the
number accordingly.</P>

<P class="docText">Another important value to control is the maximum number of sockets.
Start with the same number of sockets as there are network buffers,
and then tune as appropriate.</P>

<P class="docText">You can find out how many network buffer clusters are in use with the
command <TT>netstat -m</TT>. You can specify the values you
want in <I>/boot/loader.conf</I>. For example:</P>

<PRE>kern.ipc.nmbclusters=8192
kern.ipc.maxsockets=8192</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">As with any performance tuning, monitor your system after making
changes. Did you go overboard or underestimate what you would need?

servers generally have longer-lived
and less frequent network connections than those on mail servers.
They usually transfer larger files.</P>

<P class="docText">To determine the optimal number of network buffer clusters, consider
how many clients you have. Multiplying the number of network buffers
by two is good practice, though some admins prefer to multiply by
four to accommodate multiple file transfers. If you have 128 clients
connecting to the file server, set the number of network buffer
clusters to 1,024 (128 2 per connection 4).</P>

you

pages per minute and at peak over 1,000 pages per minute. At a peak
