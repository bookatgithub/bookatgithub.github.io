<P class="docText">To <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2907"></A>
take advantage of the traffic
shaping functionality of your FreeBSD system, you need a kernel with
the following options:</P>

<PRE>options IPFIREWALL
options DUMMYNET
options HZ=1000</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText"><TT>dummynet</TT> does not require the
<TT>HZ</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2908"></A>
 option, but its manpage strongly
recommends it. See  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-2.html#bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-2"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #69]</span></A>  for
more about <TT>HZ</TT> and  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-2.html#bsdhks-CHP-6-SECT-2"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #54]</span></A>  for detailed instructions
about compiling a custom kernel.</P>

<P class="docText">The traffic-shaping mechanism delays packets so as not to exceed the
transfer speed limit. The delayed packets are stored and sent later.
The kernel timer triggers sending, so setting the frequency to a
higher value will smooth out the traffic by providing smaller delays.
The default value of 100 Hz will trigger sends every 10 milliseconds,
producing bursty traffic. Setting <TT>HZ=1000</TT> will
cause the trigger to happen every millisecond, resulting in less
packet delay.</P>

<P class="docText">Traffic shaping <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2909"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2910"></A>
occurs in three stages:</P>

<P class="docText">Pipes are the basic elements of the traffic shaper. A pipe emulates a
network link with a certain bandwidth, delay, and packet loss rate.</P>

<P class="docText">Queues implement weighted fair queuing and cannot be used without a
pipe. All queues connected to a pipe share the bandwidth of that pipe
in a certain configurable proportion.</P>

<P class="docText">The most important parameter of a pipe configuration is its
bandwidth. Set the bandwidth with this <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2911"></A>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2912"></A>
command:</P>

<PRE># <B>ipfw pipe 1 config bw 120kbit/s</B></PRE><BR>


<P><table border="0" bgcolor="black" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="90%" align="center"><tr><td><table bgcolor="white" width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"><tr><td width="60" valign="top"><img src="images/pushpin.gif" width="52" height="51"></td><td valign="top">
<P class="docText">This is a sample command run at the command prompt. However, as the
hack progresses, we'll write the actual
<TT>dummynet</TT> policy as rules within an
<TT>ipfw</TT> rulebase.</P>
</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></P><br>

<P class="docText">This command creates pipe 1 if it does not already exist, assigning
it 120 kilobits per second of bandwidth. If the pipe already exists,
its bandwidth will be changed to 120 Kbps.</P>

<P class="docText">When configuring a queue, the two most important parameters are the
pipe number it will connect to and the weight of the queue. The
weight must be in the range 1 to 100, and it defaults to 1. A single
pipe can connect to multiple queues.</P>

<PRE># <B>ipfw queue 5 config pipe 1 weight 20</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This command instructs <TT>dummynet</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2913"></A>
 to configure queue
5 to use pipe 1, with a weight of 20. The weight parameter allows you
to specify the ratios of bandwidth the queues will use. Queues with
higher weights will use more bandwidth.</P>

<P class="docText">To calculate the bandwidth for each queue, divide the total bandwidth
of the pipe by the total weights, and then multiply each weight by
the result. For example, if a 120 Kbps pipe sees active traffic
(called <span class="docEmphasis">flows</span>) from three queues with weights 3,
2, and 1, the flows will receive 60 Kbps, 40 Kbps, and 20 Kbps,
respectively.</P>

<P class="docText">If the flow from the queue with weight 2 disappears, leaving only the
flows with weights 3 and 1, those will receive 90 Kbps and 30 Kbps,
respectively. (120 / (3+1) = 30, so multiply each weight by 30.)</P>

<P class="docText">The weight concept may seem strange, but it is rather simple. Queues
with equal weights will receive the same amount of bandwidth. If
queue 2 has double the weight of queue 1, it has twice as much
bandwidth. Queues that have no traffic are not taken into account
when dividing traffic. This means that in a configuration with two
queues, one with weight 1 (for unimportant traffic) and the other
with weight 99 (for important business traffic), having both queues
active will result in 1%/99% sharing, but if there is no traffic on
the 99 queue, the unimportant traffic will use all of the bandwidth.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-3.3"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.3.3 Using Masks</H4>

<P class="docText">Another <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2914"></A>
very useful option is to create a
mask by adding <TT>mask</TT>
<TT><I>mask-specifier</I></TT> at the end your
<TT>config</TT> line. Masks allow you to turn one flow into
several flows; the mask will distinguish the different flows.</P>

<P class="docText">The default mask is empty, meaning all packets fall into the same
flow. Using <TT>mask all</TT> would make all connections
significant, meaning that every TCP or UDP connection would appear as
a separate flow.</P>

<P class="docText">When you apply a mask to a pipe, each of that pipe's
flows acts as a separate pipe. Yet, each of those flows is an exact
clone of the original pipe, in that they all share the same
parameters. This means that the three active flows from our example
pipe will use 360 Kbps, or 120 Kbps each.</P>

<P class="docText">For a queue, the flows will act as several queues, each with the same
weight as the original one. This means you can use the mask to share
a certain bandwidth equally. For our example with three flows and the
120 Kbps pipe, each flow will get a third of that bandwidth, or 40
Kbps.</P>

<P class="docText">This hack assumes that you will integrate these rules in your
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2915"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2916"></A>
firewall configuration or that you are
using <TT>ipfw</TT> only for traffic shaping. In the latter
case, having the
<TT>IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2917"></A>
 option in the kernel will greatly
simplify your task.</P>

<P class="docText">In this hack, we sometimes limit only incoming or outgoing bandwidth.
Without this option, we would have to allow traffic in both
directions, traffic through the loopback interface, and through the
interface we will not limit.</P>

<P class="docText">However, you should consider disabling the
<TT>IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT</TT> option, as it will
drop packets that your policy does not specifically allow.
Additionally, enabling the option may cause you to accept potentially
malicious traffic you hadn't considered. The example
configurations in this hack were tested with an
<TT>ipf</TT>-based firewall that had an explicit deny rule
at the end.</P>

<P class="docText">When integrating traffic shaping into an existing
<TT>ipfw</TT> firewall, keep in mind that an <TT>ipfw
pipe</TT> or <TT>ipfw queue</TT> rule is equivalent to
"ipfw accept after slow down . . .
" if the <TT>sysctl</TT>
<TT>net.inet.ip.fw.one_pass</TT> is set to 1 (the default).
If the <TT>sysctl</TT> is set to 0, that rule is just a
delay in a packet's path to the next rule, which may
well be a deny or another round of shaping. This hack assumes that
the default behavior of the pipe and queue commands is to
<TT>accept</TT> or an equivalent action.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-3.4"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.3.4 Simple Configurations</H4>

<P class="docText">There are several ways of limiting
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2918"></A>
bandwidth. Here are some examples
that assume an external interface of <TT>ed0</TT>:</P>

ipfw add 100 pipe 1 ip from any to any in  recv ed0

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.3.5 Complex Configurations</H4>

<P class="docText">Here
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2919"></A>
are a couple of real-life
examples. Let's start by limiting a web
server's outgoing traffic speed, which is a
configuration I have used on one of my servers. The server had some
FreeBSD ISO files, and I did not want it to hog all the outgoing
bandwidth. I also wanted to prevent people from gaining an unfair
advantage by using download accelerators, so I chose to share the
total outgoing bandwidth equally among 24-bit networks.</P>

<PRE># pipe configuration, 2000 kilobits maximum
ipfw pipe 1 config bw 2000kbits/s

# the queue will be used to enforce the /24 limit mentioned above
ipfw queue 1 config pipe 1 mask dst-ip 0xffffff00

# with this mask, only the first 24 bits of the destination IP
# address are taken into consideration when generating the flow ID

# divert outgoing traffic from the web server (at 1.1.1.1)
ipfw add queue 1 tcp from 1.1.1.1 80 to any out</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Another real-life example involves limiting incoming traffic by
department. This configuration limits the incoming bandwidth for a
small company behind a 1 Mbps connection. Before this was applied,
some users were using peer-to-peer clients and download accelerators,
and they were hogging almost all the bandwidth. The solution was to
implement some weighted sharing between departments and let the
departments take care of their own hogs.</P>

<P class="docText">The incoming limit is set to 95% of the true available bandwidth.
This will allow the shaper to delay some packets. If this were not
the case and the pipe had the same bandwidth as the physical link,
all of the delay queues for the pipe would have been empty. The extra
5% of bandwidth on the physical link fills the queues. The shaper
chooses packets from the queues based on weight, passing through
packets from queues with a higher weight before packets from queues
with lower weight.</P>
