a good
administrator, you back up on a regular basis and periodically
perform a test restore. You create images  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-2-SECT-12.html#bsdhks-CHP-2-SECT-12"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #23]</span></A>  of important servers so you

<P class="docText">Are you prepared if a system simply refuses to boot?</P>

<P class="docText">Some parts of your drives are as important as your data, yet few
backup programs back them up. I'm talking about your
partition table and your boot blocks. Pretend for a moment that these
somehow become corrupted. The good news is that your operating system
and all of your data still exist. The bad news is that you can no
longer access them.</P>

<P class="docText">Fortunately, this is recoverable, but only if you've
done some preparatory work <span class="docEmphasis">before</span> the disaster.
Let's see what's required to create
an emergency repair kit.</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-4.1"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.4.1 Inventory of the Kit</H4>

<P class="docText">When you install a system, particularly a server, invest some time
preparing for an emergency. On a FreeBSD system, your kit should
include:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">The original install CD (or two floppies containing
<I>kern.flp</I> and <I>mfsroot.flp </I>or
one floppy containing <I>boot.flp</I>)</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A floppy containing additional drivers,
<I>drivers.flp</I></P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2927"></A>
fixit floppy, <I>fixit.flp
(</I>or a CD containing the live filesystem; this will be the
second, third, or fourth CD in a set, but <span class="docEmphasis">not</span>
the first CD)</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A printout of your partition table, <I>/etc/fstab</I>,
and <I>/var/run/dmesg.boot</I></P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Place these items in an envelope and store it in a secure location
with your backup tapes. Make a note on the envelope of the system to
which this kit should apply, along with the version of the operating
system. Ideally, you should have two copies of both your emergency
kit and backup media. Store the second copy off-site.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-4.2"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.4.2 Preparing the Floppies</H4>

<P class="docText">Regardless of how you install a system, take a few minutes to
download the <I>*.flp</I> files found in the
<I>floppies</I><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2928"></A>
 directory. This is especially
important if you use <TT>cvsup</TT> to upgrade a system, as
you can go months or years without the installation CD-ROM or floppy
media. Your aim is to test these floppies on your system
<span class="docEmphasis">before</span> a disaster strikes. The last thing you
want to be doing in an emergency is scurrying around creating
floppies only to find that an essential driver is missing.</P>

<P class="docText">Here, I'll connect to the main FreeBSD FTP server
and download the files for an i386, 5.1-RELEASE system:</P>

<P class="docText">I find it convenient to create a <I>floppies</I>
directory with subdirectories for each version of FreeBSD I have
running in my network. I then download the appropriate
<I>*.flp</I> files to the appropriate subdirectory so
they are available when I wish to create an emergency repair kit for
a new system.</P>

<P class="docText">Once you have all five files, you can decide which ones
you'll need for your particular system. To perform
an emergency repair, you'll need some way to load
your version of the operating system into memory so you can access
the utilities on the fixit floppy and restore whatever damage has
happened to your own operating system. There are several ways to load
an operating system.</P>

<P class="docText">The first approach is to boot directly from the install CD-ROM,
assuming it is bootable and your BIOS supports this. If this is your
scenario, you don't need
<I>boot.flp</I>, <I>kern.flp</I>, or
<I>mfsroot.flp</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">If booting from the CD-ROM isn't an option, you can
use either <I>boot.flp</I> or both
<I>kern.flp</I> and <I>mfsroot.flp</I>.
<I>boot.flp</I> is basically the contents of the other
two floppies placed onto one floppy. The kicker is that you need a
floppy capable of holding 2.88 MB of data.</P>

<P class="docText">Depending upon your hardware, you may or may not need
<I>drivers.flp</I>. If the installer detected all of
your hardware, you won't need this floppy.
Otherwise, you will. Finally, if you don't have a CD
containing the live filesystem, you'll need
<I>fixit.flp</I>, as this floppy contains the actual
repair utilities.</P>

<P class="docText">Use <TT>dd</TT> to transfer these files to floppies. Repeat
this for each <I>*.flp</I> file you require, using a
different floppy for each file:</P>

<PRE># <B>dd if=fixit.flp of=/dev/fd0</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Label <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2929"></A>

of FreeBSD and write protect the floppies.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.4.3 The Rest of the Kit</H4>

<P class="docText">Before testing your floppies, print some important system
information—you won't remember all of these
details in an emergency. First, you'll want a copy
of your filesystem layout:</P>

you're ready to test
that your kit works before sealing the envelope and sending it off
for secure storage. First, boot the system using either your CD-ROM
or the emergency floppies. Once the kernel has loaded and probed your
hardware, the screen will ask: <TT>Would you like to load
kernel</TT> <TT>modules from the driver floppy?</TT>
If you choose yes, you will be asked to insert the
<I>drivers.flp</I> floppy and will be presented with a
list of modules to choose from:</P>

<PRE>cd9660.ko   
if_awi.ko
if_fwe.ko
if_sk.ko
if_sl.ko
if_sn.ko
&lt;snip&gt;</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Taking a look at those modules, aren't you glad
you're testing your kit <span class="docEmphasis">before</span>
an emergency? While the modules don't have the most
descriptive names, it's easy to find out what each
module represents if you have access to a working system. For
example, the modules that begin with <TT>if</TT> are
interfaces. To see what type of interface
<TT>if_awi.ko</TT> is:</P>

<PRE>% <B>whatis awi</B>
awi(4)      - AMD PCnetMobile IEEE 802.11 PCMCIA wireless network driver</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">You can <TT>whatis</TT> each name; just
don't include the beginning <TT>if</TT> or
the trailing <TT>.ko</TT>. If you do need any of these
drivers, save yourself some grief and write yourself a note
explaining which drivers to choose off of the
<I>drivers.flp</I>. The lucky bloke who has to repair
the system will thank you for this bit of homework.</P>

<P class="docText">Once you exit from this menu, you'll be prompted to
remove the floppy. You'll then be presented with the
<TT>sysinstall Main Menu</TT> screen. Choose
<TT>Fixit</TT> from the menu and insert
<I>fixit.flp</I>. You should be prompted to press
<TT>Alt F4</TT>, and you should then see a <TT>Good
Luck!</TT> screen with a <TT>Fixit#</TT> prompt.
Excellent, your floppy is good and your repair kit is complete. Type
<TT>exit</TT> to return to the menu and exit your way out
of the install utility.</P>
