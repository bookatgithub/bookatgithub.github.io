<P class="docText">Let's go back to that sysinstall Main Menu screen
 <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-4.html#bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-4"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #71]</span></A>  and see what happens
when you choose <TT>Fixit</TT>. You'll be
presented with the following options:</P>

<PRE><B>Please choose a fixit option</B>
  There are three ways of going into "fixit" mode:
  - you can use the live filesystem CDROM/DVD, in which case there will be
    full access to the complete set of FreeBSD commands and utilities,
  - you can use the more limited (but perhaps customized) fixit floppy,
  - or you can start an Emergency Holographic Shell now, which is
    limited to the subset of commands that is already available right now.

<P class="docText">If you choose the <TT>Shell</TT> option,
you'll find that they weren't
kidding when they warned you'd be limited to a
subset of commands. Nearly all of the commands you know and love will
result in a <I>not found</I> error message. This is why
you went to the trouble of either creating that
<I>fixit</I> floppy or purchasing/burning a CD-ROM/DVD
that contains the live filesystem.</P>

<P class="docText">It's not a bad idea to create those
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2938"></A>
symlinks
now, before you forget. You'll have to mount your
root slice first, so refer to your <I>/etc/fstab</I>
printout for the proper name of that slice. In this example,
<I>/</I> is on <I>/dev/ad0s1a</I>.
I'll mount it with the read-write option:</P>

<PRE>Fixit# <B>mount -o rw /dev/ad0s1a /mnt</B>
Fixit#</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If your command is successful, you'll receive the
prompt back. A quick <TT>ls</TT> through
<I>/mnt</I> should convince you that you now have
access to the hard disk's root filesystem.</P>

<P class="docText">If your command is not successful, run
<TT>fsck_ffs</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2939"></A>
 until the filesystem is clean, then
mount the filesystem:</P>

Fixit# <B>ln -f -s /mnt/etc/group /etc</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that you need to include the force (<TT>-f</TT>)
switch when you make your symbolic (<TT>-s</TT>) links. You
need to overwrite the existing link that links
<TT>mnt2</TT>, or the fixit floppy, to
<I>/etc</I>. You instead want to link the files on your
hard drive (<I>/mnt</I>) to <I>/etc</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">You'll also notice that while in the
<TT>Fixit#</TT> prompt, the up arrow will recall history,
but tab completion does not work.</P>

<P class="docText">At that <TT>Fixit#</TT> prompt, you have two command sets
available to you. The first is that limited command set that comes
with the <TT>sysinstall</TT> utility. Note that these are
the only commands available at that holographic shell prompt:</P>

<P class="docText">You'll also find a minimal set of notes in:</P>

<PRE>Fixit# <B>ls stand/help</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">One of the first things you'll notice, especially if
you try to read one of those help documents, is the lack of a pager.
You won't have any luck with <TT>more</TT>
or <TT>less</TT>. However, <TT>cat</TT> and
<TT>view</TT> are available for viewing files. If
you've never used <TT>view</TT> before,
remember to type <TT>:q</TT> to quit the viewer.</P>

<P class="docText">Also note that all of the restore utilities are on hand, unless
you've used <TT>pax</TT> as your backup
utility.</P>

pause here for a moment and
compare the fixit floppy to the live filesystem.
There's one CD marked as live in a purchased set. If
you burn your own ISO images, the second image for your release will
contain the live filesystem. For example, here is the listing for

<P class="docText"><TT>disc1.iso</TT> is the install CD, and
<TT>disc2.iso</TT> is the live filesystem CD.</P>

<P class="docText">There are several advantages to using the live filesystem. First, you
don't have to make any floppies. In fact, your
entire kit can be as simple as this one CD and your printouts
specific to that system. Second, the CD is bootable, so you can reach
that <TT>Fixit#</TT> prompt in under a minute.</P>

<P class="docText">Third, you have the entire built-in command set available to you.
When you enter the <TT>Fixit</TT> screen,
you'll see the same welcome message as before. This
time, it is the CD that is mounted as <I>/mnt2</I>,
which is really a link to <I>/dist</I>:</P>

<PRE>Fixit# <B>ls -l /mnt2</B>

<P class="docText">A quick <TT>ls /dist/bin</TT> and <TT>ls
/dist/sbin</TT> will display all of the commands that come with
a FreeBSD system. There isn't a limited command set
with the live filesystem.</P>

<P class="docText">Now that I've shown you the various ways to enter
the <TT>Fixit</TT> facility, you're
probably wondering what you should be doing at that prompt. FreeBSD
is quite robust and is usually capable of booting your hard drive to
some sort of prompt. However, if the disk fails completely or is
somehow incapable of booting to a prompt, the
<TT>fixit</TT> facility is one of your options.</P>

<P class="docText">From here, you can run <TT>fsck</TT> on your various
filesystems, which may fix the problem. You can see which filesystems
are still mountable, allowing you to assess the extent of the damage.
If some files were damaged, you can restore those files from backup.</P>

<P class="docText">If it turns out that the drive is damaged beyond repair, you can rest
easy in the fact that you have a printout of your hardware and
partitioning scheme, a floppy containing any necessary drivers, and a
backup of all of your data. Above all, you were prepared.</P>
