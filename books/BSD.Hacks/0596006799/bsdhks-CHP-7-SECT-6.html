you may not realize that you have the ability to analyze security
exploits. After all, the organization that distributes your operating
system of choice or the provider of a given application will deal
with security issues and make updates available.</P>

<P class="docText">However, keep in mind that Security Officers apply the same tools and
techniques that end users use for debugging programs. Knowing how to
analyze a problem will help you to troubleshoot any misbehaving
process in a Unix environment.</P>

<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-6.1"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.1 An Example Exploit</H4>

<P class="docText">Analyzing a malfunctioning process starts with basic information,
such as error messages and return values. Sometimes those
aren't enough, though. Some error messages are
unclear. In the case of security vulnerabilities, there may not be an
error code or return value, because the program may crash or
misbehave silently.</P>

<P class="docText">The BSDs provide several tools to analyze a
program's execution. You can monitor system calls
with <TT>ktrace</TT> and resources with
<TT>fstat</TT>. You can run a debugger such as GDB, the GNU
Debugger, and watch your operating system's internal
operation.</P>

<P class="docText">In some cases, a program must run in a particular environment, which
may make it difficult to analyze due to the limitations of some
tools. For example, a <TT>telnetd</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2950"></A>
 advisory from 2001 (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-21.html">http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-21.html</A>)
affected most Unix operating systems. This particular vulnerability
came to light when a group called TESO released an example exploit
for it.</P>

<P class="docText">On Unix systems, <TT>telnetd</TT> runs as root, so that
once the system authenticates the user, the process has the
privileges required to set the user ID of the login shell to that of
the user who logged in. This means that a remote entity who can cause
<TT>telnetd</TT> to misbehave by sending it carefully
designed input could execute processes as root on your system.</P>

<P class="docText">On most Unix systems, <TT>telnetd</TT> does not run as a
standalone daemon. Since logins are relatively infrequent (on the
system timescale compared to thousands of interrupts per second), the
<TT>inetd</TT> service starts <TT>telnetd</TT> as
needed.</P>

<P class="docText">This is a simple example of the data stream sufficient to crash
vulnerable <TT>telnetd</TT>s using <TT>perl</TT>
and <TT>nc</TT> (netcat):</P>

<PRE>% <B>perl -e 'print "\377\366"x512' |  nc testhost telnet</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This was the example I used to diagnose the problem and test the fix.
If you run this command against an impervious Telnet daemon,
you'll see the following output:</P>

<PRE>% <B>perl -e 'print "\377\366"x512' | nc testhost telnet</B>

[Yes]

[Yes]

[Yes]</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <TT>[Yes]</TT> message will repeat 512 times because
the characters you sent, <TT>\377\366</TT>, represent the
Telnet protocol's "ARE YOU
THERE" control message, and you asked the question
<TT>512</TT> times.</P>

<P class="docText">If you run this command against a vulnerable
<TT>telnetd</TT>, the output can vary. In some cases, your
connection may close before you get 512 <TT>[Yes]</TT>
responses because <TT>telnetd</TT> crashed. In other cases,
you may receive seemingly random output from portions of the
<TT>telnetd</TT> memory space. These both indicate that the
program did something it was not supposed to, due to the specific
input you gave it.</P>

order to fix the problem, we need to
find out where the executable did something incorrectly. We would
like to run the program under the control of GDB, but we cannot start
<TT>telnetd</TT> from the command line the way we usually
would when debugging most executables. Normally, GDB is invoked in
one of three ways.</P>

<P class="docText">First, to run a program and debug it, type:</P>

<PRE>% <B>gdb </B>
<span class="docEmphBoldItalic">programname</span>

<P class="docText">If this is your first time using <TT>gdb</TT>, type

<P class="docText">Second, to examine the core file of a program that has already
crashed, use:</P>

<PRE>% <B>gdb </B>
<span class="docEmphBoldItalic">programname</span>
<B> </B>
<span class="docEmphBoldItalic">programname</span>
<B>.core</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Third, to examine a program that is already running, type:</P>

<PRE>% <B>gdb </B>
<span class="docEmphBoldItalic">programname</span>
<B> </B>
<span class="docEmphBoldItalic">processid</span></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">In the case of <TT>telnetd</TT>, we cannot use the first
method, because <TT>inetd</TT> must start
<TT>telnetd</TT> in order to attach it to a network socket
and operate properly. We cannot use the second method, because
processes that run with root privileges do not leave core files,
since the program's memory image could contain
sensitive data.</P>

<P class="docText">That leaves the third method. Attaching to a running process is
problematic because <TT>telnetd</TT> isn't
running until someone connects. We'll need to modify
our attack script:</P>

<PRE>% <B>perl -e 'sleep 30; print "\377\366"x512' |  nc testhost telnet</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Now <TT>nc</TT> opens a socket to the testhost,
<TT>inetd</TT> spawns a <TT>telnetd</TT> in
response, and <TT>perl</TT> waits for 30 seconds before
sending the attack string.</P>

<P class="docText">In another terminal, on the testhost, we say:</P>

<PRE>% <B>ps -ax | grep telnetd</B>
27857 ??  S      0:00.05 telnetd
27859 pd  S+     0:00.02 grep telnetd

% <B>gdb /usr/libexec/telnetd 27857</B>
GNU gdb[...]
Attaching to program `/usr/libexec/telnetd', process 27857</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">From here we can allow <TT>telnetd</TT> to crash and
observe the exact type of error that caused the crash. If
we've built <TT>telnetd</TT> with
debugging information, GDB will even display the line of source code
the program was executing when it crashed. Now we can use our
favorite debugging techniques and either insert debugging messages or
use GDB and set breakpoints and watchpoints to discover at what point
the program went off course. We can then determine what changes to
make to correct the error and prevent the exploit.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're not a programmer, you can save the
information and send it <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2952"></A>
to <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2953"></A>
the developers.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.3 Hacking the Hack</H4>

<P class="docText">We were fortunate in this example because we had details of the
exploit. That made it easy to experiment and try different
approaches. In many cases, however, you won't know
the details of an exploit, and you may only know that there is a
problem because of error messages in your logs.</P>

<P class="docText">You can use <TT>tcpdump</TT> to capture the traffic on the
relevant port. Once you can correlate the timestamp of the
log's error message with some of your
<TT>tcpdump</TT> traffic, you can take the data sent in an
attack and create a Perl script to resend it. You can then apply the
techniques already described to analyze and correct the problem.</P>
