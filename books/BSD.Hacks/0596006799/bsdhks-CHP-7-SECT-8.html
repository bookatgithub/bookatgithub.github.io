are occasions
when you can take advantage of Unix's flexibility to
control some other tool or system that is less flexible.
I've used Unix scripts to update databases on
user-unfriendly mainframe systems when the alternative was an
expensive mainframe-programming service contract. You can use the
same approach in reverse to let the user interact with a tool, but
with a constrained set of choices.</P>

<P class="docText">The Expect scripting language is ideal for creating such interactive
scripts. It is available from NetBSD <TT>pkgsrc</TT> as
<I>pkgsrc/lang/tcl-expect</I> or
<I>pkgsrc/lang/tk-expect</I>, as well as from the
FreeBSD ports and OpenBSD packages collections.
We'll use the command-line version for this example,
but keep in mind that <TT>expect-tk</TT> allows you to
provide a GUI frontend to a command-line process if
you're willing to write a more complex script.</P>

<P class="docText">In this case, we'll script the generation of a GPG
key. Install GPG from either
<I>pkgsrc/security/gnupg</I> or the appropriate port or
package.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.8.1 The Key Generation Process</H4>

<P class="docText">During the process of generating a GPG key, the program asks the user
several questions. We may wish to impose constraints so that a set of
users ends up with keys with similar parameters. We could train the
users, but that would not guarantee correct results. Scripting the
generation makes the process easier and eliminates errors.</P>

<P class="docText">First, let's look at a typical key generation
session:</P>

Please select what kind of key you want:

   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? <B>4</B>
What keysize do you want? (1024) <B>2048</B>
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire

Key does not expire at all
Is this correct (y/n)? <B>y</B>

You need a User-ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user id
from Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) &lt;heinrichh@duesseldorf.de&gt;"

Real name:</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Let's pause there to consider the elements we can
constrain.</P>

<P class="docText">You probably want to specify the cryptographic algorithm and key
length for all users consistently, based on your security and
interoperability requirements. I'll choose RSA
signing and encryption keys, but GPG doesn't provide
a menu option for that. I'll have to create the
signing key first and then add the encryption subkey.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-8.2"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.8.2 A Simple Script</H4>

<P class="docText">Here's an <TT>expect</TT> script that
would duplicate the session shown so far:</P>

<PRE>#!/usr/pkg/bin/expect -f

set timeout -1
spawn gpg --gen-key
match_max 100000
expect "(4) RSA (sign only)"
expect "Your selection? "
send "4\r"
expect "What keysize do you want? (1024) "
send "2048\r"
expect "Key is valid for? (0) "
send -- "0\r"
expect "Key does not expire at all"
expect "Is this correct (y/n)? "
send -- "y\r"
expect "Real name: "</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The script begins by <TT>set</TT>ting
<TT>timeout</TT> to infinite, or <TT>-1</TT>, so
<TT>expect</TT> will wait forever to match the provided
input. Then we <TT>spawn</TT> the process that
we're going to control, <TT>gpg
--gen-key</TT>. <TT>match_max</TT> sets some buffer
size constraints in bytes, and the given value is far more than we
will need.</P>

<P class="docText">After the initial settings, the script simply consists of strings
that we <TT>expect</TT> from the program and strings that
we <TT>send</TT> in reply. This means that the script will
answer all of the questions GPG asks until <TT>Real</TT>
<TT>name</TT>: , without waiting for the
user's input.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that in several places we expect things besides the prompt. For
example, before responding to the <TT>Your selection?</TT>
prompt, we verify that the version of GPG we have executed still has
the same meaning for the fourth option, by expecting that the text of
that menu choice is still <TT>RSA (sign</TT>
<TT>only)</TT>. If this were a real, production-ready
script, we should print a warning message and terminate the script if
the value does not match our expectations, and perhaps include a
check of the GPG version number. In this simple example, the script
will hang, and you must break out of it with Ctrl-c.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.8.3 Adding User Interaction</H4>

<P class="docText">There <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2985"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2986"></A>
are several ways of handling the fields
we do want the user to provide. For the greatest degree of control
over the user experience, we could use individual
<TT>expect</TT> commands, but here we will take a simpler
approach. Here's some more of the script:</P>

<PRE>interact "\r" return
send "\r"
expect "Email address: "
interact "\r" return
send "\r"
expect "Comment: "
interact "\r" return
send "\r"
expect "Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? "
interact "\r" return
send "\r" 
expect "Enter passphrase: "
interact "\r" return
send "\r"
expect "Repeat passphrase: "
interact "\r" return
send "\r"</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <TT>interact</TT> command allows the user to interact
directly with the spawned program. We place a constraint that the
user's interaction ends as soon as the user presses
the Enter key, which sends the carriage return character,
<TT>\r</TT>. At that point, the <TT>interact</TT>
command returns and the script resumes. Note that we have to
<TT>send</TT> the <TT>\r</TT> from the script;
<TT>expect</TT> intercepted the carriage return and GPG did
not see it.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-8.4"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.8.4 Handling Incorrect Input</H4>

<P class="docText">Again, <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2987"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-2988"></A>
a correct script would have a
more complex flow of execution and allow for cases where the spawned
program rejects the user's input with an error
message. For example, the <TT>Real Name</TT> field must be
more than five characters long. If a user types less than five
characters, GPG will prompt him to retype his username. However, the
<TT>expect</TT> script just shown will not accept the new
user input, because it is now waiting for the <TT>Email
address</TT>: prompt.</P>

<P class="docText">Alternatively, we could replace these three lines:</P>

<PRE>interact "\r" return
send "\r"
expect "Email address: "</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">with:</P>

<PRE>interact -o "Email address: " return
send_user "Email address: "</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Instead of stopping interaction when the user presses
<TT>return</TT>, we stop interaction when the program
outputs the <TT>Email address</TT>: prompt.
That's the difference between
<TT>interact</TT> and <TT>interact -o</TT>; the
former stops interaction based on input from the user, and the latter
on output from the program. This time, we don't need
to send the carriage return, because the user's
keypress is passed through to GPG. However, we do need to echo the
prompt, because <TT>expect</TT> has consumed it. This
method lets GPG handle the error conditions for us:</P>

<PRE>Real name: abc
Name must be at least 5 characters long
Real name: abcde
Email address:</PRE><BR>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.8.5 Hacking the Hack</H4>

<P class="docText">After GPG receives the information it needs to generate the key, it
might not be able to find enough high-quality random data from the
system. The script ought to handle that by spawning a process to
generate more system activity, such as performing a lot of disk
activity by running a <TT>find</TT> across the entire disk.</P>

<P class="docText">After generating the signing key, the script could spawn a new
instance of GPG with the <TT>--edit-key</TT> option, to
generate the desired RSA encryption key.</P>

<P class="docText">Although the final script may end up executing three processes, the
whole process is seamless to the user. You can hide even more of the
guts by using <TT>expect</TT>'s
<TT>log_user</TT> setting to hide the output of the
programs at points where the user does not need to see them.</P>

<P class="docText">You can use a script like this in conjunction with any Unix
command-line program. By combining <TT>expect</TT> with
<TT>telnet</TT> or <TT>ssh</TT>, you can control
non-Unix systems, thereby leveraging the flexibility of Unix into a
non-Unix domain. This even works with programs for which you do not
have source code, such as control utilities for commercial databases
or application software.</P>

<P class="docText">In the case of GPG, we do have source code, so we
<span class="docEmphasis">could</span> modify the program, but writing an
<TT>expect</TT> script is easier. A carefully designed
<TT>expect</TT> script may not require changes when a new
version of GPG is released. Source code changes to GPG would require
integration with any new version of GPG.</P>
