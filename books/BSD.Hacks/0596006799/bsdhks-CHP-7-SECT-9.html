frequently represent NetBSD at trade
shows. It's challenging to attract attention because
there are many booths at a show—people will walk by quickly
unless something catches their eye. You also need to balance
eye-candy with functionality so that you can attract and keep a
visitor's attention. I needed an enticing demo to
run on one of the computers in the booth.</P>

<P class="docText">I wanted to show off several applications, such as office
productivity tools, video, and games, and have music playing, but
there's only so much screen real estate. Cramming
all of those things on the screen at once would clutter the screen,
and the point would be lost.</P>

<P class="docText">Most X window managers have some concept of virtual desktops,
separate work spaces that you can flip between. For example,
Enlightenment (<I>pkgsrc/wm/enlightenment</I>) not only
has the concept of virtual desktops, but as an added bonus for the
trade show environment offers a nice sliding effect as you transition
from one desktop to the next.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.9.1 Introducing eesh</H4>

<P class="docText">Normally in Enlightenment, to switch from one virtual desktop to the
next, you move the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen and then
push past it, or you use a key sequence to move to an adjacent
desktop. For an unattended demo, we need to automate this process.
Enlightenment provides an undocumented utility called
<TT>eesh</TT> that can control most aspects of the
Enlightenment window manager. You can write scripts to move windows,
resize them, or flip between desktops.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that <TT>eesh</TT> isn't a friendly
utility; it doesn't even produce a prompt when you
run it. Type <TT>help</TT> for the menu or

<P class="docText">Unfortunately, the <TT>eesh</TT> utility seems to be
untested. It sometimes behaves inconsistently by not accepting
commands until you enter them a second time or by withholding output
until you press Enter again. As an example, there are actually more
commands than those indicated in the <TT>help</TT> listing.

<P class="docText">We'll start our script by making sure that
Enlightenment is configured the way we want for our demo. We want six
work spaces (3 by 2) to display our programs. Within
<TT>eesh</TT>, try the following commands:</P>

<PRE><B>num_areas ?</B>

<B>help num_areas</B>
Enlightenment IPC Commands Help : num_areas (sna)
--------------------------------
Change the size of the virtual desktop
Use "num_areas &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt;" to change the size of the virtual desktop.
Example: "num_areas 2 2" makes 2x2 virtual destkops
Use "num_areas ?" to retrieve the current setting

<B>num_areas 3 2</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Now we have the number of areas we want. <TT>areas</TT> is
the Enlightenment name for virtual desktops, since Enlightenment also
supports multiple desktops, but that's different.
Now we'd like our screen to display the first area,
so that the programs our script runs will open there:</P>

<PRE><B>goto_area 0 0</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If your terminal wasn't on the first area, it just
moved off the screen. Use the mouse to return to that area.</P>

<P class="docText">When you run the script, the screen will slide around to the various
areas and pause a few seconds between program launches. We have most
of the things we wanted: music, video, and applications. The next
step is to keep it moving. Try the following script:</P>

<PRE>#!/bin/sh
while [ 1 ]
do
        eesh -e "goto_area 0 0"
        sleep 2

        eesh -e "goto_area 2 1"
        sleep 2
done</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">To stop the moving display, you have to get your keyboard focus into
the <TT>xterm</TT> where the script is running so that you
can press Ctrl-c. That can be difficult, but we'll
address it shortly.</P>


<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-SECT-9.4"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.9.4 More Complex Scripts</H4>

<P class="docText">For a complex demonstration, you can have different sets of these
scripts that visit different sets of areas. You can also change the
delay so that complex areas display for a longer period. I also made
a script that clears all of the viewing areas. That way, when
visitors to the booth play around with the machine, I can easily
reset to a clean state and then start the demo again.</P>

<P class="docText">Since many of the utilities you'll demonstrate
don't create <I>.pid</I> files, I find
it easiest to use <TT>pkill</TT>, the
"kill process by name" utility.
(FreeBSD provides <TT>killall</TT>.)</P>

<P class="docText">I'll also leave you with two example scripts that
show how to extract information about
Enlightenment's current settings for use in a more
complex script.</P>

<P class="docText">The first script is <TT>retitle</TT>:</P>

<PRE>#!/bin/sh

WIN=`eesh -ewait "set_focus ?" | sed 's/^focused: //' `
xterm -geometry 47x7+227+419 -fn -*-courier-*-o-*-*-34-*-*-*-*-*-*-* -e \
/home/david/bin/retitle2 $WIN</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The second is <TT>retitle2</TT>:</P>

<PRE>#!/bin/sh
WIN=$1
echo "enter new title:"
read TITLE
eesh -e "win_op $WIN title $TITLE"</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">With these scripts and
<TT>e16keyedit</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-3001"></A>
, you can bind a key combination to
change the title of any window. This makes it much easier to keep
track of <TT>xterm</TT>s, if you prefer task-oriented
titles.</P>

<P class="docText">Now back to the control issue. When I first wrote this demo, I used a
switch wired to a serial port to start and stop the demo so that
keyboard focus did not matter. However, wiring switches is more work
than configuring software, so I found a better way.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>e16keyedit</TT> utility, written by Geoff
"Mandrake"

Harrison and
Carsten "Raster"
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-7-ITERM-3003"></A>
Haitzler
(the primary developers of Enlightenment), allows you to bind
function keys and Meta keys to run programs or perform the same
functions that you can with <TT>eesh</TT>. Using
<TT>e16keyedit</TT>, you can define function keys to set up
the demo, clean up the demo, and start and stop the area rotations.
Since the function keys can be bound to work anywhere within
Enlightenment, keyboard focus no longer matters.
You're ready to give a fantastic demo!</P>
