run into a problem: if the <TT>installworld</TT> fails

<P class="docText">What if you're like me and believe in the

FreeBSD From Scratch solves all these
problems. The strategy is simple: use a running system to install a
new system under an empty directory tree, mounting new partitions in
that tree as appropriate. Many config files can copy straight across,
and <TT>mergemaster</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-8-ITERM-3022"></A>
can take care of those that cannot. You
can perform arbitrary post-configuration of the new system from
within the old system, up to the point where you can
<TT>chroot</TT> to the new system.</P>

<P class="docText">This upgrade has three stages, where each stage either runs a shell
script or invokes <TT>make</TT>:</P>

<P class="docText">This hack uses several scripts and configuration files that you can
download from the original document's site (listed
in this hack's <A class="docLink" HREF="#bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-3.4">Section 8.3.4</A> section). Also, if you keep
your docs up-to-date with <TT>cvsup</TT>, the scripts and
original document can be found in
<I>/usr/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/fbsd-from-scratch</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">The script for stage one is <I>stage_1.sh</I>. When run

<P class="docText">it will read its configuration from
<I>stage_1.conf.default</I> and write a log to
<I>stage_1.log.default</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">You'll need to customize
<I>stage_1.conf.default</I> to match your idea of the
perfect system. I have tried to comment all of the sections you
should adapt. In addition to the customized sections, the
configuration script must provide four shell functions:</P>

<P class="docText">The <I>stage_1.sh</I> script will stop at the first

typo.</P>

<TT>cap_mkdb</TT> in either case.</P>

<P class="docText">You can download the author's
<I>stage_1.conf.default</I>, which
you'll need to modify substantially. The comments
should give you enough information regarding what to change.</P>

<P class="docText">Pay attention to the <TT>newfs</TT> commands. While you
cannot create new filesystems on mounted partitions, the script will
happily erase any unmounted partitions. This can be enough to ruin
your day, so be sure to modify the device names to match your
scenario.</P>

<P class="docText">Running this script installs a system that, when booted, provides
inherited users and groups, firewalled Internet connectivity over
Ethernet and PPP, correct time zone settings and NTP, and more minor
configurations, such as <I>/etc/ttys</I> and
<I>/etc/inetd.conf</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">Other areas of configuration will not work until stage two completes.
For example, we have copied files to configure printing and X11.
Printing, however, needs applications not found in the base system.
Similarly, X11 will not run before we have compiled the server,
libraries, and programs.</P>

<P class="docText">It
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-8-ITERM-3023"></A>
is
possible to install precompiled packages at this stage instead of
compiling ports. In this case, <I>stage_2.sh</I> will
be nothing more than a scripted list of <TT>pkg_add</TT>
commands.</P>

<P class="docText">I install my favorite ports via the downloadable
<I>stage_2.sh</I> script. You can run it multiple times
safely, as it will skip all ports that are already installed. It also
supports the dry run option (<TT>-n</TT>), which will show
what would be done. Run it like <I>stage_1.sh</I>, with
exactly one argument to denote a config file:</P>

<PRE># <B>./stage_2.sh default</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This example will read the list of ports from
<I>stage_2.conf.default</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">The actual list of ports consists of lines with two or more
space-separated words: the category and the port, optionally followed
by an installation command that will compile and install the port. By
default, this is <TT>make</TT> <TT>install</TT>.
Most of the time, it suffices to name only the category and port. You
can fine-tune some ports by specifying <TT>make</TT>
variables, as found in the port's
<I>Makefile</I>:</P>

<PRE>www mozilla make WITHOUT_MAILNEWS=yes WITHOUT_CHATZILLA=yes install
mail procmail make BATCH=yes install</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">In fact, you can specify arbitrary shell commands, so you are not
restricted to simple <TT>make</TT> invocations:</P>

<PRE>java linux-sun-jdk14 yes | make install
news inn-stable CONFIGURE_ARGS="--enable-uucp-rnews --enable-setgid-inews" \
    make install</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that the line for <TT>news/inn-stable</TT> includes an
example of a one-shot shell variable assignment to
<TT>CONFIGURE_ARGS</TT>. The port's
<I>Makefile</I> will use this as an initial value and
augment some other essential args.</P>

<P class="docText">The difference between specifying a <TT>make</TT> variable
on the command line (as in the last example) and the following:</P>

<PRE>news inn-stable make CONFIGURE_ARGS="--enable-uucp-rnews \
    --enable-setgid-inews" install</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">is that the latter will <span class="docEmphasis">override</span> instead of

<P class="docText">Be careful that your ports do not use an interactive install; they
should not try to read from stdin. If they do, they will read the

<I>stage_2.sh</I> mysteriously skips a port or stops
processing, this is likely the reason.</P>

<P class="docText">You
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-8-ITERM-3024"></A>
installed
your beloved ports during stage two, but some ports require a little
bit of configuration. This is the job of stage three, the
post-configuration stage. I have chosen to implement stage three as a
<I>Makefile</I> because this allows easy selection of
what you want to configure simply by running:</P>

<PRE># <B>make -f stage_3.mk target</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">As with <I>stage_2.sh</I>, make sure you have
<I>stage_3.mk</I> available after booting the new
system, either by putting it on a shared partition or by copying it
somewhere on the new system.</P>

<P class="docText">Automating the installation of a port may prove difficult if it is
interactive and does not support <TT>make BATCH=YES
install</TT>. For a few ports, the interaction is nothing more
than typing <TT>yes</TT> when asked to accept some license.
If such input is read from the standard input, we simply pipe the
appropriate answers to the installation command, usually
<TT>make install</TT>. This is how I dealt with
<I>java/linux-sun-jdk14</I> in the previous example.</P>

<P class="docText">This strategy, however, does not work for
<I>editors/staroffice52</I>, which requires that X11 is
running. The installation procedure involves a fair amount of
clicking and typing, so it cannot be automated like other ports can.
However, the following workaround does the trick for me. First, I
created a <I>staroffice</I> package on the old system
with:</P>

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">Upgrading Configuration Files</H2>

<P class="docText">Be aware of upgrade issues for config files. In general, you do not
know when and if the format or contents of a config file changes. A
new group may be added to <I>/etc/group</I>, or
<I>/etc/passwd</I> may gain another field. Simply
copying a config file from the old to the new system may be enough
most of the time, but in these cases it is not. Unfortunately,
<TT>mergemaster</TT> is available only for base system
files, not for anything installed by ports. All you can do is be
alert, especially when the major version number bumps. All actively
maintained software programs are prime candidates for config file
scrutiny. To detect such silent changes, I keep a copy of the
modified config files in the same place where I keep
<I>stage_3.mk</I> and compare the result with a
<TT>make</TT> rule. For example, I examine
Apache's <I>httpd.conf</I> in target
<TT>config_apache</TT> with:</P>

<PRE># ... automated httpd.conf modifications here ...
@if ! cmp -s /usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf httpd.conf; then \
    echo "ATTENTION: the httpd.conf has changed. Please examine if"; \
    echo "the modifications are still correct. Here is the diff:"; \
    diff -u /usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf httpd.conf; \
fi</PRE><BR>
