<P class="docText">There <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3272"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3273"></A>
are so many GUI utilities, available
either as part of your favorite Window Manager or as a separate
installation, that you can forget that the core X distribution also
provides several useful and lightweight programs. Do you need to
monitor console messages, manage your clipboard, send pop-up
messages, or create and view screenshots? Before you hit the ports
collection, give the built-in utilities a try.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.13.1 Seeing Console Messages</H4>

<P class="docText">In  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-5-SECT-2.html#bsdhks-CHP-5-SECT-2"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #42]</span></A>, we
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3274"></A>
saw how
to redirect console messages. If you're using an X
session, the <TT>xconsole</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3275"></A>
 utility fulfills this purpose. To start
this utility, simply type its name into an <TT>xterm</TT>
or use the Run command provided by your window manager.</P>

<P class="docText">By default, only the superuser can start <TT>xconsole</TT>.
A regular user will instead receive a <TT>Couldn't open
console</TT> message. This is a safety precaution on multiuser
systems, preventing regular users from viewing system messages. If
you're the only user who uses your system, remove
the comment (<TT>#</TT>) from this line in
<I>/etc/fbtab</I>:</P>

<PRE>#/dev/ttyv0    0600    /dev/console</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you spend a lot of your time at an X session, consider adding
<TT>xconsole</TT> to your <I>~/.xinitrc</I>
file so it will start automatically (see  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-10.html#bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-10"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #9]</span></A>).</P>

<TT>xclipboard</TT><A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3276"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3277"></A>
 is another excellent candidate for
automatic startup. This utility stores each of your clipboard
selections as a separate entity, allowing you to scroll through them
one at a time in a simple GUI window. In addition to the Next and
Prev buttons, a Delete button lets you remove unwanted items and a
Save button allows you to save all of your items as a file.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.13.3 Sending Pop-up Messages</H4>

<P class="docText">Do <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3278"></A>
you find yourself starting a command
that takes a while to execute, continuing your work in an X session,
then returning periodically to the original terminal or
<TT>xterm</TT> to see how that command is perking along?
Wouldn't it be easier to send yourself a pop-up
message once the command completes?</P>

<P class="docText">For example, suppose I want to know when the script from  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-5.html#bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-5"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #80]</span></A>  finishes. I could execute
that script as follows:</P>

<PRE>#<B>~/bin/mycustomupgrade.sh &amp;&amp; xmessage -nearmouse cvsup is complete.</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">When the upgrade completes, a pop-up message with the text
<TT>cvsup is</TT> <TT>complete</TT>. will appear
in my X session near my mouse. That message will disappear once I
click on the Okay button.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're in the habit of using <TT>su
-l</TT> to provide a new login when you become the superuser,
you'll find that the preceding command will fail to
send you a pop-up menu. (I'm assuming
you're logged in as a regular user when you start
your X session. You should be!) Instead, you'll
receive this error message:</P>

<PRE>Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified
Error: Can't open display: :0.0</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This has to do with the X authorization process. If I start my X
session as the user <TT>dru</TT> and use
<TT>su</TT> to execute a command, I'm
still logged in as <TT>dru</TT>, so I'm
allowed to send a message to my display. However, if I use
<TT>su -l</TT> to execute the command, I'm
no longer logged in as <TT>dru</TT> but as
<TT>root</TT>. The X server refuses to let another user
interfere with my display, which is a good thing.</P>

<P class="docText">A quick workaround is to not use <TT>su -l</TT> when
sending pop-up messages to your regular user account. An alternative
is to understand the X authorization process. You can then use this
knowledge to enable the superuser to send a message to any user on
any display.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">9.13.3.1 Understanding X authorization</H5>

<P class="docText">Your <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3279"></A>
X
server uses a token known as an <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3280"></A>
 <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3281"></A>
<I>MIT magic
cookie</I> to provide authorization. When you start your X
session, the server creates and stores this unique cookie in
<I>~/.Xauthority</I>. You can view it at any time using
this <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3282"></A>
command:</P>

<PRE>% <B>xauth list</B>
genisis/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  7e7bc20f9413469a7376e2e5c91aa6f1</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Take note that you're the only user with access to
this file:</P>

<PRE>% <B>ls -l ~/.Xauthority</B>
-rw-------  1  dru  wheel   101  Feb 18 13:28 .Xauthority</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Always keep in the back of your mind, though, that file ownership
does not matter to the superuser. For example, if I need to send an
important message to the user <TT>dru</TT>, I can
<TT>ssh</TT> into the system she's working
on and become the superuser. Then:</P>

<PRE># <B>cp ~dru/.Xauthority .</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">I now have a copy of <TT>dru</TT>'s magic
cookie. However, before I can use it, I'll first
have to change my display. Since I <TT>ssh</TT>ed into a
terminal, I currently don't have one:</P>

<PRE># <B>echo $DISPLAY</B>
DISPLAY: Undefined variable.</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">I don't want just any display, I want the display
<TT>dru</TT> is currently using. I can find the name of her
display by reading her magic cookie:</P>

<PRE># <B>xauth list</B>
genisis/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  7e7bc20f9413469a7376e2e5c91aa6f1</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The name of her display is <TT>genisis/unix:0</TT>, where
<TT>genisis</TT> represents the hostname of the system.
I'll now attach to that display and send my message:</P>

<PRE># <B>setenv DISPLAY genisis/unix:0</B>
# <B>xmessage -nearmouse Time to go home, Dru...</B>
(prompt hangs until dru responds by pressing the "Okay" button)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This cheat works on any system to which you have superuser access.
Technically, you can execute any command X understands in a
user's X session once you have his cookie and
display. Do remember to use your <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3283"></A>
superuser powers for good, though.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.13.4 Taking Screenshots</H4>

<P class="docText">Have you ever needed to send a user a
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3284"></A>
screenshot? There are ports available for
this purpose, but the built-in X <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3285"></A>
command <TT>xwd</TT> will
suffice. Creating a screenshot is a simple matter of:</P>

<PRE>% <B>xwd -out screenshot.xwd</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The command will appear to hang as it waits for you to click your
mouse on the portion of the screen you'd like to
capture. Use the <TT>-root</TT> switch to capture the
entire screen and save yourself a click.</P>

<P class="docText">You can view and manipulate the resulting file with most third-party
image editors, including <TT>xv</TT> and
<TT>gimp</TT>. For quick viewing, though, nothing beats
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3286"></A>
the built-in
<TT>xwud</TT>:</P>

<PRE>% <B>xwud -in screenshot.xwd</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Your results won't seem that impressive if you use
<TT>xwud</TT> immediately, as your screen still probably
looks like your screenshot. When you're finished
viewing the screenshot, press Ctrl-c.</P>
