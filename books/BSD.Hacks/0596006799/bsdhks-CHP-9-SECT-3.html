<P class="docText">Creating a manpage isn't all that difficult. After
all, a manpage is simply a text file—more specifically, a
<TT>gzip</TT>ped text file sprinkled with
<TT>groff</TT> macros. (I'm quite sure
<TT>groff</TT> gets its name from the choking sound you
make as you try to decipher <span class="docEmphasis">its</span> manpage.) For
<TT>man</TT> to do its magic, which starts with being able
to <span class="docEmphasis">find</span> the page, the manpage must live in a
directory <TT>manpath</TT> can see.</P>

<P class="docText">Not surprisingly, <TT>manpath</TT>'s
configuration <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3146"></A>

<I>/etc/manpath.config</I>, contains those paths:</P>

# MANPATH_MAP          path_element         manpath_element
MANPATH_MAP           /bin                 /usr/share/man
MANPATH_MAP           /usr/bin             /usr/share/man
MANPATH_MAP           /usr/local/bin       /usr/local/man
MANPATH_MAP           /usr/X11R6/bin       /usr/X11R6/man</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Basically, manpages to programs that come with the system live in
<I>/usr/share/man</I>, third-party applications use
<I>/usr/local/man</I>, and X applications use
<I>/usr/X11R6/man</I>. If you <TT>ls</TT> any

<P class="docText">Notice first that the lines that began with <TT>.\</TT>"
don't appear anywhere in the formatted manpage, as
they are comments. The information in the title

the manpage. The <TT>.SH</TT> lines appear nicely bolded,

<P class="docText">If you want to include fancier formatting in your

manpage, find an existing
manpage that has the desired format. Then, instead of opening the
manpage with <TT>man</TT>, send it to
<TT>zmore</TT>. (Remember, you won't be
able to read <TT>gzip</TT>ped manpages directly with
<TT>more</TT>.)</P>

I'd borrow from a manpage with switches.
<TT>ls</TT> springs to mind. So I'll read
through:</P>

<PRE>% <B>zmore /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">and compare it to <TT>man ls</TT>. In this manpage, the
switches occur in the <TT>DESCRIPTION</TT> section and the
first switch is <TT>-A</TT>. The switch itself is in bold
text and the switch description is indented with the characters
. and <TT>.</TT>. covered over with
white. The formatting sequences to achieve this are:</P>

<P class="docText">If you're curious as to the exact meaning of each

throughout <TT>man 7 groff</TT>. If you
don't have the time to be curious, simply find the
section that does what you want and add it to your own manpage. Save
your results, then see if it worked by sending your custom manpage to

manpages.
If you've ever tried sending a manpage directly to a
printer, you probably found that the results weren't
what you were expecting. However, you can use
<TT>groff</TT> to convert the manpage to something more
printer-friendly. PostScript is usually your best bet, and
you're in luck, as <TT>groff</TT> knows
how to convert to PostScript.</P>

<P class="docText">First, it's not a bad idea to get the exact location
of the source of the manpage. Continuing with <TT>ls</TT>
as an example:</P>

<PRE>% <B>man -w ls</B>
/usr/share/man/cat1/ls.1.gz (source: /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that you're interested in the source, not in
the location that includes the word <TT>cat</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Once you know the location, use <TT>zcat</TT> to open the
compressed file, pipe the results to <TT>groff</TT>, and
redirect the <TT>groff</TT> output to a PostScript file:</P>

<PRE># <B>zcat /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz | groff &gt; ls.ps</B>
# <B>file ls.ps</B>
ls.ps: PostScript document text conforming at level 3.0</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Note that the default invocation of <TT>groff</TT> assumes
that you wish to convert a manpage to PostScript, so you need no
additional switches.</P>
