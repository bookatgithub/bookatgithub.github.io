<P class="docText">Despite <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3170"></A>
all your best efforts, eventually
you'll end up with multiple versions of a file.
Perhaps you forgot to keep your <I>.vimrc</I> in sync
between two machines  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-11.html#bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-11"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #10]</span></A> .
Alternatively, you may want to see the changes between an old
configuration file and the new version. You may even want to
distribute a bugfix to a manpage or program.</P>

<P class="docText">Sending the entire changed file won't always work:
it takes up too much space and it's hard to find
exactly what changed. It's often easier and usually
faster to see only the changes (see  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-5.html#bsdhks-CHP-8-SECT-5"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #80]</span></A>  for a practical example).
That's where <TT>diff</TT> comes in: it
shows the differences between two files.</P>

<P class="docText">As you'd expect, applying changes manually is
tedious. Enter <TT>patch</TT>, which applies the changes

 redirecting this output to a file, I
can produce a patch file. Though anyone who can read
<TT>diff</TT> output could apply those changes manually,
it's much easier to use the <TT>patch</TT>
program, especially if the file I'm patching has had
other changes in the meantime. As long as those changes do not
overlap, <TT>patch</TT> will work magically well.</P>

<P class="docText">It's
<A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3175"></A>
often
handy to create patches from normal files, as in the previous
example, when sharing code or text with another user.
It's also useful to see the differences between
configuration files when upgrading an application. Knowing how to
read a diff between your version of <I>httpd.conf</I>
and <I>httpd.conf.default</I> can save you hours of
debugging time.</P>

<P class="docText">What if you want to find differences between entire directories,
though? Suppose you want to see the changes between two versions of a
program. If you can't upgrade to the new version
right away but want to see if there's a patch
available that you can apply, use <TT>diff</TT> on the
directories themselves. Be sure to pass the recursive flag
(<TT>-r</TT>) if you want to compare files in
subdirectories:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>diff -ur sdl/trunk SDL_Perl-2.1.0 &gt; sdl_trunk.patch</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If that's not appropriate and you want to patch only
a couple of files at a time, run <TT>diff</TT> multiple
times. Append the output to a combined patch.
<TT>patch</TT> is smart enough to recognize the start of
file markers:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>diff -u sdl/trunk/CHANGELOG SDL_Perl-2.1.0/CHANGELOG &gt;&gt; \</B>
    <B>sdl_textfiles.patch</B>
$ <B>diff -u sdl/trunk/README SDL_Perl-2.1.0/README &gt;&gt; \</B>
    <B>sdl_textfiles.patch</B>
$ <B>diff -u sdl/trunk/INSTALL SDL_Perl-2.1.0/INSTALL &gt;&gt; \</B>
    <B>sdl_textfiles.patch</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Finally, if you need to create a patch for a file that
doesn't exist, use the null file flag
(<TT>-n</TT>) with <I>/dev/null</I> as the
source:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>diff -un /dev/null SDL_Perl-2.1.0/LICENSE &gt;&gt; \</B>
    <B>sdl_textfiles.patch</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This will create the file when someone applies the patch. You could
also <TT>touch</TT> the file in the source directory.</P>

much easier when you're

patching source code or text files in core BSD. Modify the code in
your tree, make sure it works, and then use <TT>cvs</TT>

Subversion, the likely successor to CVS,
generates the right kind of patches without the <TT>-u</TT>

port and a NetBSD package for Subversion. You can also download
