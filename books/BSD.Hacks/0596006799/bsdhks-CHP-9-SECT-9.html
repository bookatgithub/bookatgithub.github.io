<P class="docText">Fortunately the <TT>leave</TT> <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3219"></A>

embarrassment of forgetting important appointments. Use it at any
time by typing:</P>

<PRE>% <B>leave</B>
When do you have to leave?</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">There are three ways to respond to that question:</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.9.2 Creating Terminal Sticky Notes</H4>

<P class="docText"><TT>leave</TT> is nice for scheduling your own departure,
but what if you want to schedule the execution of commands? I bet
you're thinking "use
<TT>at</TT> or <TT>cron</TT>."
Have <A NAME="bsdhks-CHP-9-ITERM-3220"></A>
you ever
tried the scheduler built into <TT>tcsh</TT>?</P>

<P class="docText">While <TT>sched</TT> can execute any command at a given
time, you can also use it as a reminder system. I use it as a
terminal sticky-note system that won't clutter up my
monitor. For example, it's 9:00,
I've just logged in, and I'm
mulling over my to-do list for the day. As I mentally review my list,
I type the following:</P>

<PRE>% <B>sched 11:55 echo Lunch with Robyn today.</B>
% <B>sched 2:30 echo Reminder: project due by 4:30.</B>
% <B>sched 5:00 echo Go home!!!</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Now at any point in the day I can review my to-do list:</P>

<PRE>% <B>sched</B>

1     11:55    echo Lunch with Robyn today.
2     2:30     echo Reminder: project due by 4:30.
3     5:00     echo Go home!!!</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">As each appointed time arrives, the desired reminder will appear on
my terminal.</P>

<P class="docText">To remove an item from your to-do list, simply type <TT>sched
-</TT><TT><I>#</I></TT>, where
<TT><I>#</I></TT> represents the number of that item in
the schedule. Logging out of your shell will also remove all items
from your list since <TT>sched</TT> is a shell command.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.9.3 Saving Your Schedule</H4>

<P class="docText">What if you plan on logging out during the day? You certainly
don't want to recreate your schedule every time you
log in. It's a simple matter to save the schedule.
Place this line in your <I>~/.logout</I> file:</P>

<PRE>sched &gt; schedule</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This will send the output of <TT>sched</TT> to a file in
your home directory called <I>schedule</I>, saving any
items in your to-do list to the specified file when you log out.</P>

<P class="docText">Unfortunately, there's no simple way to pipe that
list back into <TT>sched</TT> when you log back in. This
has to do with how the C shell handles its built-in commands. You
would think that:</P>

<PRE>% <B>sched &lt; schedule</B></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">would reverse the process, but it doesn't. If you
really miss your shell sending you reminders at their appointed
times, consider locking your terminal  <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-8.html#bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-8"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #7]</span></A>  instead of logging out during
the day.</P>
