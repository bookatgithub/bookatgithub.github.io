known locally as JR, is a system administrator in Kingston, Ontario,
Canada. His trademark in the field is his insistence on a FreeBSD box

Bernier's professional

trials. In the 1980s, his interest returned to IT when he realized he
wouldn't have to use a punch card anymore.
Eventually he discovered Linux and by the mid-1990s had developed a
passion for all things open source. Today, Robert teaches at the
local community college and writes for a number of IT publications
based in North America and Europe.</P><P class="docList"> <A class="docLink" HREF="bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-13.html#bsdhks-CHP-1-SECT-13"><span class="docEmphBold">[Hack #12]</span></A> </P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Kirk <A NAME="bsdhks-PREFACE-1-ITERM-1647"></A>
