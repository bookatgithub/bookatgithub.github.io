term
<span class="docEmphasis">hacking</span> has an unfortunate reputation in the
popular press, where it often refers to someone who breaks into
systems or wreaks havoc with computers. Among enthusiasts, on the
other hand, the term <span class="docEmphasis">hack</span> refers to a
"quick-n-dirty" solution to a
problem or a clever way to do something. The term
<span class="docEmphasis">hacker</span> is very much a compliment, praising
someone for being <span class="docEmphasis">creative</span> and having the
technical chops to get things done.
O'Reilly's Hacks series is an
attempt to reclaim the word, document the ways people are hacking (in
a good way), and pass the hacker ethic of creative participation on
to a new generation of hackers. Seeing how others approach systems
and problems is often the quickest way to learn about a new
technology.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">BSD Hacks</span> is all about making the most of your
BSD system. The BSDs of today have a proud lineage, tracing back to
some of the original hackers—people who built Unix and the
Internet as we know it today. As you'd expect, they
faced many problems and solved problems both quickly and elegantly.
We've collected some of that wisdom, both classic
and modern, about using the command line, securing systems, keeping
track of your files, making backups, and, most importantly, how to
become your own BSD guru along the way.</P>
