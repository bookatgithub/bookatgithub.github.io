<blockquote><p class="docText"><i>"What was it about UNIX that won my heart? . . .
UNIX is mysterious when you first approach. A little intimidating,
too. But despite an unadorned and often plain presentation, the
discerning suitor can tell there's lot going on
under the surface."</i></p><p class="docText"><i>—Thomas Scoville, <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://unix.oreilly.com/news/unix_love_0299.html">http://unix.oreilly.com/news/unix_love_0299.html</A></i></p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">When the above-mentioned article was first published, I was still
very much a BSD newbie. My spare hours were spent struggling with
kernel recompiles, PPP connectivity (or lack thereof),
<TT>rm</TT> and <TT>chmod</TT> disasters, and
reading and rereading every bit of the then available documentation.
Yet, that article gave voice to my experience, for, like the quoted
author, I had stumbled upon operating system love. In other words, I
was discovering how to hack on BSD.</P>

<P class="docText">Since then, I've learned that there is an unspoken
commonality between the novice Unix user and the seasoned guru. It
doesn't matter whether you've just
survived your first successful installation or
you've just executed a complex script that will save
your company time and money, the feeling is the same.
It's the excitement of venturing into unknown
territory and discovering something new and wonderful.
It's that sense of accomplishment that comes with
figuring something out for yourself, with finding your own solution
to the problem at hand.</P>

<P class="docText">This book contains 100 hacks written by users who love hacking with
BSD. You'll find hacks suited to both the novice
user and the seasoned veteran, as well as everyone in between. Read
them in any order that suits your purpose, but keep the
"onion principle" in mind. While
each hack does present at least one practical solution to a problem,
that's just the outer layer. Use your imagination to
peel away deeper layers, exposing new solutions as you do so.</P>
