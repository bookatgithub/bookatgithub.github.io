<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphSmaller><A name="Beautiful code"></A>Beautiful code was conceived by greg wilson in 2006</SPAN><A name="to elicit"></A> as a way to elicit insights from leading software developers and computer scientists. Together, he and his co-editor, Andy Oram, approached experts with diverse backgrounds from all over the world. They received a flood of responses, partly because royalties from the book are being donated to Amnesty International. The results of the project appear in this volume.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="book is"></A>As wide-ranging as this book is, it represents just a small fraction of what is happening in this most exciting of fields. Thousand of other projects, equally interesting and educational, are being moved forward every day by other programmers whom we did not contact. Furthermore, many excellent practitioners who were asked for chapters do not appear in this book because they were too busy at the time, preferred not to contribute to Amnesty International, or had conflicting obligations. To benefit from the insights of all these people, we hope to do further books along similar lines in the future.</P><A name=how_this_book_is_organized></A>
