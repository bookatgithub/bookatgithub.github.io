<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphSmaller><A name="notations for"></A>Regular expressions are notations for describing patterns of text</SPAN><A name="a special"></A> and, in effect, make up a special-purpose language for pattern matching. Although there are myriad variants, all share the idea that most characters in a pattern match literal occurrences of themselves, but some <SPAN class=docEmphasis>metacharacters</SPAN><A name="such as"></A> have special meaning, such as * to indicate some kind of repetition or […] to mean any one character from the set within the brackets.<A name=idx-CHP-1-0003></A><A name=idx-CHP-1-0004></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="in programs"></A>In practice, most searches in programs such as text editors are for literal words, so the regular expressions are often literal strings like <TT>print</TT>, which will match <TT>printf</TT> or <TT>sprint</TT> or <TT>printer paper</TT> anywhere. In so-called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>wildcards</SPAN><A name="number of"></A> used to specify filenames in Unix and Windows, a * matches any number of characters, so the pattern <TT>*.c</TT><A name="filenames that"></A> matches all filenames that end in <TT>.c.</TT><A name="of regular"></A> There are many, many variants of regular expressions, even in contexts where one would expect them to be the same. Jeffrey Friedl's <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Mastering Regular Expressions</SPAN><A name="the topic"></A> (O'Reilly) is an exhaustive study of the topic.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=Stephen></A>Stephen <A name=idx-CHP-1-0005></A><A name="expressions in"></A>Kleene invented regular expressions in the mid-1950s as a notation for finite automata; in fact, they are equivalent to finite automata in what they represent. They first appeared in a program setting in Ken <A name=idx-CHP-1-0006></A><A name="QED text"></A>Thompson's version of the QED text editor in the mid-1960s. In 1967, Thompson applied for a patent on a mechanism for rapid text matching based on regular expressions. The patent was granted in 1971, one of the very first software patents [U.S. Patent 3,568,156, Text Matching Algorithm, March 2, 1971].</P>
<P class=docText><A name=idx-CHP-1-0007></A><A name="moved from"></A>Regular expressions moved from QED to the Unix editor <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ed</SPAN><A name="the quintessential"></A>, and then to the quintessential Unix tool <SPAN class=docEmphasis>grep</SPAN>, which Thompson created by performing radical surgery on <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ed</SPAN><A name="the early"></A>. These widely used programs helped regular expressions become familiar throughout the early Unix community.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="was very"></A>Thompson's original matcher was very fast because it combined two independent ideas. One was to generate machine instructions on the fly during matching so that it ran at machine speed rather than by interpretation. The other was to carry forward all possible matches at each stage, so it did not have to backtrack to look for alternative potential matches. In later text editors that Thompson wrote, such as <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ed</SPAN><A name="a simpler"></A>, the matching code used a simpler algorithm that backtracked when necessary. In theory, this is slower, but the patterns found in practice rarely involved backtracking, so the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ed</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>grep</SPAN><A name="enough for"></A> algorithm and code were good enough for most purposes.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Subsequent regular"></A>Subsequent regular expression matchers like <SPAN class=docEmphasis>egrep</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>fgrep</SPAN><A name="of regular"></A> added richer classes of regular expressions, and focused on fast execution no matter what the pattern. Ever-fancier regular expressions became popular and were included not only in C-based libraries, but also as part of the syntax of scripting languages such as Awk and Perl.<A name=idx-CHP-1-0008></A><A name=idx-CHP-1-0009></A></P><A name=the_practice_of_programming></A>
<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>1.1. The Practice of Programming</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="and I"></A>In 1998, Rob Pike and I were writing <SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="of Programming"></A>The Practice of Programming</SPAN><A name="of the"></A> (Addison-Wesley). The last chapter of the book, "<A name=idx-CHP-1-0010></A>Notation," collected a number of examples where good <A name=idx-CHP-1-0011></A><A name="use of"></A>notation led to better programs and better programming. This included the use of simple data specifications (<TT>printf</TT><A name="the generation"></A>, for instance), and the generation of code from tables.<A name=idx-CHP-1-0012></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="backgrounds and"></A>Because of our Unix backgrounds and nearly 30 years of experience with tools based on regular expression notation, we naturally wanted to include a discussion of regular expressions, and it seemed mandatory to include an implementation as well. Given our emphasis on tools, it also seemed best to focus on the class of regular expressions found in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>grep</SPAN><A name="also then"></A>—rather than, say, those from shell wildcards—since we could also then talk about the design of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>grep</SPAN> itself.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="The problem"></A>The problem was that any existing regular expression package was far too big. The local <SPAN class=docEmphasis>grep</SPAN><A name="long "></A> was over 500 lines long (about 10 book pages) and encrusted with barnacles. Open source regular expression packages tended to be huge—roughly the size of the entire book—because they were engineered for generality, flexibility, and speed; none were remotely suitable for pedagogy.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Rob that"></A>I suggested to Rob that we find the smallest regular expression package that would illustrate the basic ideas while still recognizing a useful and nontrivial class of patterns. Ideally, the code would fit on a single page.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="into his"></A>Rob disappeared into his office. As I remember it now, he emerged in no more than an hour or two with the 30 lines of C code that subsequently appeared in <A class=docLink href="054.top_down_operator_precedence.html#top_down_operator_precedence">Chapter 9</A> of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>The Practice of Programming</SPAN><A name="a regular"></A>. That code implements a regular expression matcher that handles the following constructs.</P><A name=I_book_tt2id7173></A>

<P class=docText><A name=using></A>This is quite a useful class; in my own experience of using <A name=idx-CHP-1-0016></A><A name="on a"></A>regular expressions on a day-to-day basis, it easily accounts for 95 percent of all instances. In many situations, solving the right problem is a big step toward creating a beautiful program. Rob deserves great credit for choosing a very small yet important, well-defined, and extensible set of features from among a wide set of options.</P>
<P class=docText>Rob's <A name=idx-CHP-1-0017></A><A name="superb example"></A>implementation itself is a superb example of beautiful code: compact, elegant, efficient, and useful. It's one of the best examples of recursion that I have ever seen, and it shows the power of C pointers. Although at the time we were most interested in conveying the important role of good notation in making a program easier to use (and perhaps easier to write as well), the regular expression code has also been an excellent way to illustrate algorithms, data structures, testing, performance enhancement, and other important topics.</P></DIV></DIV>
