Text deltas are expressed as streams of fixed-sized windows, each window containing a chunk of binary diff data.

	 *
	 * In Subversion, we've got various producers and consumers of tree
	 * deltas.
	 *
	 * In processing a `commit' command:
	 * - The client examines its working copy data, and produces a tree
	 *   <A name=idx-CHP-2-0077></A>delta describing the changes to be committed.
	 * - The client networking library consumes that delta, and sends them
	 *   across the wire as an equivalent series of network requests.
	 * - The server receives those requests and produces a tree delta --
	 *   hopefully equivalent to the one the client produced above.
	 * - The <A name=idx-CHP-2-0078></A>Subversion server module consumes that delta and commits an
	 *   appropriate transaction to the filesystem.
	 *
	 * In processing an `update' command, the process is reversed:
	 * - The Subversion server module talks to the filesystem and produces
	 *   a tree delta describing the changes necessary to bring the
	 *   client's working copy up to date.
	 * - The server consumes this delta, and assembles a reply
	 *   representing the appropriate changes.
	 * - The client networking library receives that reply, and produces a
	 *   tree delta --- hopefully equivalent to the one the Subversion
	 *   server produced above.
	 * - The working copy library consumes that delta, and makes the
	 *   appropriate changes to the working copy.
	 *
	 * The simplest approach would be to represent tree deltas using the
	 * obvious data structure. To do an update, the server would
	 * construct a delta structure, and the working copy library would
	 * apply that structure to the working copy; the network layer's job
	 * would simply be to get the structure across the net intact.
	 *
	 * However, we expect that these deltas will occasionally be too large
	 * to fit in a typical workstation's swap area. For example, in
	 * checking out a 200Mb source tree, the entire source tree is
	 * represented by a single tree delta. So it's important to handle
	 * deltas that are too large to fit in swap all at once.
	 *
	 * So instead of representing the tree delta explicitly, we define a
	 * standard way for a consumer to process each piece of a tree delta
	 * as soon as the producer creates it. The <B>svn_delta_editor_t</B>
	 * structure is a set of callback functions to be defined by a delta
	 * consumer, and invoked by a delta producer. Each invocation of a
	 * callback function describes a piece of the delta --- a file's
	 * contents changing, something being renamed, etc.

	 * as it produces the delta.
	 *
	 * Function Usage
	 * ============== 
	 *
	 * Here's how to use these functions to express a tree delta.
	 *
	 * The delta consumer implements the callback functions described in
	 * this structure, and the <A name=idx-CHP-2-0080></A>delta producer invokes them. So the
	 * caller (producer) is pushing tree delta data at the callee
	 * (consumer).
	 *
	 * At the start of traversal, the consumer provides <B>edit_baton</B>, a
	 * baton global to the entire delta edit. 
	 *
	 * Next, if there are any tree deltas to express, the producer should
	 * pass the <B>edit_baton</B> to the <B>open_root</B> function, to get a baton
	 * representing root of the tree being edited.
	 *
	 * Most of the callbacks work in the obvious way:
	 *
	 * <B>delete_entry</B>
	 * <B> add_file</B>
	 * <B>add_directory</B>
	 * <B>open_file</B> 
	 * <B>open_directory</B>
	 *
	 * Each of these takes a directory baton, indicating the directory
	 * in which the change takes place, and a <B>path</B> argument, giving the
	 * path (relative to the root of the edit) of the file,
	 * subdirectory, or directory entry to change. Editors will usually
	 * want to join this relative path with some base stored in the edit
	 * baton (e.g. a URL, a location in the OS filesystem). 
	 *
	 * Since every call requires a parent directory baton, including
	 * <B>add_directory</B> and <B>open_directory</B>, where do we ever get our
	 * initial directory baton, to get things started? The <B>open_root</B>
	 * function returns a baton for the top directory of the change. In
	 * general, the producer needs to invoke the editor's <B>open_root</B>
	 * function before it can get anything of interest done.
	 *
	 * While <B>open_root</B> provides a directory baton for the root of
	 * the tree being changed, the <B>add_directory</B> and <B>open_directory</B>
	 * callbacks provide batons for other directories. Like the
	 * callbacks above, they take a <B>parent_baton</B> and a relative path
	 * <B>path</B>, and then return a new baton for the subdirectory being
	 * created / modified --- <B>child_baton</B>. The producer can then use
	 * <B>child_baton</B> to make further changes in that subdirectory. 
	 *
	 * So, if we already have subdirectories named `foo' and `foo/bar',
	 * then the producer can create a new file named `foo/bar/baz.c' by
	 * calling:
	 *
	 *     - <B>open_root</B> () --- yielding a baton <B>root</B> for the top directory
	 *
	 *     - <B>open_directory</B> (root, "foo")
	 *
	 *     - <B>open_directory</B> (f, "foo/bar") --- yielding a baton b for `foo/bar' 
	 *
	 *     - <B>add_file</B> (b, "foo/bar/baz.c")
	 *
	 * When the producer is finished making changes to a directory, it
	 * should call <B>close_directory</B>. This lets the consumer do any
	 * necessary cleanup, and free the baton's storage.
	 *
	 * <B>The add_file</B> and <B>open_file</B> callbacks each ret urn a baton
	 * for the file being created or changed. This baton can then be
	 * passed to <B>apply_textdelta</B><A name=idx-CHP-2-0081></A> to change the file's contents.
	 * When the producer is finished making changes to a file, it should
	 * call <B>close_file</B>, to let the consumer clean up and free the baton. 
	 *
	 * Function Call Ordering
	 * ======================
	 *
	 * There are five restrictions on the order in which the producer
	 * may use the batons: 
	 *
	 * 1. The producer may call <B>open_directory, add_directory</B>,
	 *    <B>open_file, add_file</B> at most once on any given directory
	 *	  entry. <B>delete_entry</B> may be called at most once on any given
	 *    directory entry and may later be followed by <B>add_directory</B> or
	 *	 <B>add_file</B> on the same directory entry. <B>delete_entry</B> may
	 *    not be called on any directory entry after <B>open_directory</B>,
	 *   <B>add_directory,open_file</B> or <B>add_file</B> has been called on
	 *    that directory entry.
	 *
	 * 2. The producer may not close a directory baton until it has
	 *    closed all batons for its subdirectories. 
	 *
	 * 3. When a producer calls <B>open_directory</B> or <B>add_directory</B>,
	 *    it must specify the most recently opened of the currently open
	 *    directory batons. Put another way, the producer cannot have
	 *    two sibling directory batons open at the same time.
	 *
	 * 4. When the producer calls <B>open_file</B> or <B>add_file</B>, it must
	 *    follow with any changes to the file (using <B>apply_textdelta</B>),
	 *    followed by a <B>close_file</B> call, before issuing any other
	 *    file or directory calls.
	 *
	 * 5. When the producer calls <B>apply_textdelta</B>, it must make all of
	 *    the window handler calls (including the <B>NULL</B> window at the
	 *    end) before issuing any other <B>svn_delta_editor_t</B> calls. 
	 *
	 * So, the producer needs to use directory and file batons as if it
	 * is doing a single depth-first traversal of the tree. 
	 *
	 * Pool Usage
	 * ==========
	 *
	 * Many editor functions are invoked multiple times, in a sequence
	 * determined by the editor "driver". The driver is responsible for
	 * creating a pool for use on each iteration of the editor function,
	 * and clearing that pool between each iteration. The driver passes
	 * the appropriate pool on each function invocation. 
	 *
	 * Based on the requirement of calling the editor functions in a
	 * depth-first style, it is usually customary for the driver to similarly
	 * nest the pools. However, this is only a safety feature to ensure
	 * that pools associated with deeper items are always cleared when the
	 * top-level items are also cleared. The <A name=idx-CHP-2-0082></A>interface does not assume, nor
	 * require, any particular organization of the pools passed to these
	 * functions.
