<P class=docText><A name="The real"></A>The real strength of this API, and, I suspect, of any good API, is that it guides one's thinking. All operations involving tree modification in Subversion are now shaped roughly the same way. This not only reduces the amount of time newcomers must spend learning existing code, it gives new code a clear model to follow, and developers have taken the hint. For example, the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>svnsync</SPAN><A name="activity directly"></A> feature, which mirrors one repository's activity directly into another repository—and was added to Subversion in 2006, six years after the advent of the <A name=idx-CHP-2-0094></A><A name="editor interface"></A>delta editor—uses the delta editor interface to transmit the activity. The developer of that feature was not only spared the need to design a change-transmission mechanism, he was spared the need to even <SPAN class=docEmphasis>consider</SPAN><A name="needed to"></A> whether he needed to design a change-transmission mechanism. And others who now hack on the new code find it feels mostly familiar the first time they see it.<A name=idx-CHP-2-0095></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="Not only"></A>These are significant benefits. Not only does having the right API reduce learning time, it also relieves the development community of the need to have certain debates: design discussions that would have spawned long and contentious mailing list threads simply do not come up. That may not be quite the same thing as pure technical or aesthetic beauty, but in a project with many participants and a constant turnover rate, it's a beauty you can use.<A name=I_indexterm2_tt25></A></P></DIV></DIV>
