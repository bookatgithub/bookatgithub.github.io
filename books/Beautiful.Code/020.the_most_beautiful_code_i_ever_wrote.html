<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphSmaller><A name="a master"></A>I once heard a master programmer praised with the phrase</SPAN><A name="deleting code"></A>, "He adds function by deleting code." Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the French writer and aviator, expressed this sentiment more generally when he said, "A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." In software, the most beautiful code, the most beautiful functions, and the most beautiful programs are sometimes not there at all.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="difficult to"></A>It is, of course, difficult to talk about things that aren't there. This chapter attempts this daunting task by presenting a novel analysis of the runtime of the classic <A name=idx-CHP-3-0097></A><A name="section sets"></A>Quicksort program. The first section sets the stage by reviewing Quicksort from a personal perspective. The subsequent section is the meat of this chapter. We'll start by adding one counter to the program, then manipulate the code to make it smaller and smaller and yet more and more powerful until just a few lines of code completely capture its average runtime. The third section summarizes the techniques, and presents a particularly succinct analysis of the cost of binary search trees. The final two sections draw insights from the chapter to help you write more elegant programs.</P><A name=the_most_beautiful_code_i_ever_wrote></A>
<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>3.1. The Most Beautiful Code I Ever Wrote</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="asked myself"></A>When Greg Wilson first described the idea of this book, I asked myself what was the most beautiful code I had ever written. After this delicious question rolled around my brain for the better part of a day, I realized that the answer was easy: <A name=idx-CHP-3-0098></A><A name="question has"></A>Quicksort. Unfortunately, the one question has three different answers, depending on precisely how it is phrased.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="on divide"></A>I wrote my thesis on divide-and-conquer algorithms, and found that C.A.R. <A name=idx-CHP-3-0099></A>Hoare's Quicksort ("Quicksort," <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Computer Journal</SPAN><A name="them all"></A> 5) is undeniably the granddaddy of them all. It is a beautiful algorithm for a fundamental problem that can be implemented in elegant code. I loved the algorithm, but I always tiptoed around its innermost loop. I once spent two days debugging a complex program that was based on that loop, and for years I carefully copied that code whenever I needed to perform a similar task. It solved my problems, but I didn't <SPAN class=docEmphasis>really</SPAN><A name="understand it"></A> understand it.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="an elegant"></A>I eventually learned an elegant partitioning scheme from Nico Lomuto, and was finally able to write a Quicksort that I could understand and even prove correct. William Strunk Jr.'s observation that "vigorous writing is concise" applies to code as well as to English, so I followed his admonition to "omit needless words" (The <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Elements of Style</SPAN><A name="approximately "></A>). I finally reduced approximately 40 lines of code to an even dozen. So if the question is, "What is the most beautiful small piece of code that you've ever written?" my answer is the Quicksort from my book <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Programming Pearls</SPAN><A name="This Quicksort"></A>, Second Edition (Addison-Wesley). This Quicksort function, implemented in C, is shown in <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('quicksort_function');">Example 3-1</A><A name="refine this"></A>. We'll further study and refine this example in the next section.<A name=idx-CHP-3-0100></A></P><A name=quicksort_function></A>

<P class=docText>This code sorts a global array <TT>x[n]</TT> when called with the arguments <TT>quicksort(0, n-1)</TT><A name="the subarray"></A>. The two parameters of the function are the indexes of the subarray to be sorted: <TT>l</TT><A name=and></A> for lower and <TT>u</TT> for upper. The call <TT>swap(i, j)</TT> exchanges the contents of <TT>x[i]</TT> and <TT>x[j]</TT><A name="chooses a"></A>. The first swap randomly chooses a partitioning element uniformly selected between <TT>l</TT> and <TT>u</TT>.</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>Programming Pearls</SPAN><A name="proof of"></A> contains a detailed derivation and proof of correctness for the <TT>quicksort</TT><A name="Throughout the"></A> function. Throughout the rest of this chapter, I'll assume that the reader is familiar with Quicksort to the level presented in that description and in most elementary algorithms textbooks.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the question"></A>If you change the question to, "What is the most beautiful piece of code that you've written that was widely used?" my answer is again a <A name=idx-CHP-3-0102></A><A name="wrote with"></A>Quicksort. An article I wrote with M. D. McIlroy ("Engineering a <A name=idx-CHP-3-0103></A>sort function," <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Software–Practice and Experience</SPAN><A name="serious performance"></A>, Vol. 23, No. 11) describes a serious performance bug in the venerable Unix <TT>qsort</TT> <A name=idx-CHP-3-0104></A><A name="to build"></A>function. We set out to build a new C library <TT>sort</TT><A name="and Heap"></A> function, and considered many different algorithms for the task, including Merge Sort and Heap Sort. After comparing several possible implementations, we settled on a version of the Quicksort algorithm. That paper describes how we engineered a new function that was clearer, faster, and more robust than its competitors—partly because it was smaller. Gordon <A name=idx-CHP-3-0105></A><A name="proved true"></A>Bell's sage advice proved true: "The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren't there." That function has now been widely used for over a decade with no reports of failure.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="could be"></A>Considering the gains that could be achieved by reducing code size, I finally asked myself a third variant of the question that began this chapter. "What is the most beautiful code that you <SPAN class=docEmphasis>never</SPAN><A name="accomplish a"></A> wrote?" How was I able to accomplish a great deal with very little? The answer was once again related to Quicksort, specifically, the analysis of its performance. The next section tells that tale.</P></DIV></DIV>
