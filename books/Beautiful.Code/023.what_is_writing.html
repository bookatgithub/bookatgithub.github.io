<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>3.4. What Is Writing?</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="In a"></A>In a weak sense, I "wrote" <A class=docLink href="021.more_and_more_with_less_and_less.html#quicksort_inner_loop_instrumented_to_count_comparisons">Example 3-2</A> through <A class=docLink href="021.more_and_more_with_less_and_less.html#quicksort_calculationmdashfinal_version">Example 3-12</A><A name="wrote them"></A> of the program. I wrote them first in scribbled notes, then on a chalkboard in front of undergraduates, and eventually in this chapter. I derived the programs systematically, I have spent considerable time analyzing them, and I believe that they are correct. Apart from the spreadsheet implementation of <A class=docLink href="021.more_and_more_with_less_and_less.html#quicksort_calculation_with_the_inner_loop_removed">Example 3-11</A><A name="run any"></A>, though, I have never run any of the examples as a computer program.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="two decades"></A>In almost two decades at Bell Labs, I learned from many teachers (and especially from Brian Kernighan, whose chapter on the teaching of programming appears as <A class=docLink href="005.a_regular_expression_matcher.html#a_regular_expression_matcher">Chapter 1</A><A name="a program"></A> of this book) that "writing" a program to be displayed in public involves much more than typing symbols. One implements the program in code, runs it first on a few test cases, then builds thorough scaffolding, drivers, and a library of cases to beat on it systematically. Ideally, one mechanically includes the compiled source code into the text without human intervention. I wrote <A class=docLink href="020.the_most_beautiful_code_i_ever_wrote.html#quicksort_function">Example 3-1</A> (and all the code in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Programming Pearls</SPAN>) in that strong sense.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="honest by"></A>As a point of honor, I wanted to keep my title honest by never implementing <A class=docLink href="021.more_and_more_with_less_and_less.html#quicksort_inner_loop_instrumented_to_count_comparisons">Example 3-2</A> through <A class=docLink href="021.more_and_more_with_less_and_less.html#quicksort_calculationmdashfinal_version">Example 3-12</A><A name="decades of"></A>. Almost four decades of computer programming have left me with deep respect for the difficulty of the craft (well, more precisely, abject fear of bugs). I compromised by implementing <A name=idx-CHP-3-0144></A><A class=docLink href="021.more_and_more_with_less_and_less.html#quicksort_calculation_with_the_inner_loop_removed">Example 3-11</A><A name="tossed in"></A> in a spreadsheet, and I tossed in an additional column that gave the closed-form solution. Imagine my delight (and relief) when the two matched exactly! And so I offer the world these beautiful unwritten programs, with some confidence in their correctness, yet painfully aware of the possibility of undiscovered error. I hope that the deep beauty I find in them will be unmarred by superficial blemishes.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="these unwritten"></A>In my discomfort at presenting these unwritten programs, I take consolation from the insight of Alan Perlis, who said, "Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to see it as a soap bubble?"</P></DIV></DIV>
