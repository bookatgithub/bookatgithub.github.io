<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>4.2. Problem: Weblog Data</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="look at"></A>Let's look at a sample problem to get a feel for how a search works in real life. I have a directory containing logfiles from my weblog (<A name=idx-CHP-4-0149></A><A class=docLink href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing" target=_blank>http://www.tbray.org/ongoing</A><A name="late "></A>) from early 2003 to late 2006; as of the writing of this chapter, they recorded 140,070,104 transactions and occupied 28,489,788,532 bytes (uncompressed). All these statistics, properly searched, can answer lots of questions about my traffic and readership.<A name=idx-CHP-4-0150></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="simple question"></A>Let's look at a simple question first: which articles have been read the most? It may not be instantly obvious that this problem is about search, but it is. First of all, you have to search through the logfiles to find the lines that record someone fetching an article. Second, you have to search through those lines to find the name of the article they fetched. Third, you have to keep track, for each article, of how often it was fetched.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="an example"></A>Here is an example of one line from one of these files, which wraps to fit the page in this book, but is a single long line in the file:</P>

<DD>
<P class=docList><A name="we don"></A>We want to read all the lines of the input, and we don't care whether they're from files named on the command line or are being piped in from another program on the standard input. The designers of Ruby believe strongly that programmers shouldn't have to write ugly code to deal with common situations, and this is a common situation. So, <TT>ARGF</TT><A name="special variable"></A> is a special variable that represents all the input sources. If the command line includes arguments, ARGF assumes they're names of files and opens them one by one; if there aren't any, it uses the standard input.</P>
<P class=docList><TT>each_line</TT><A name="you can"></A> is a method that you can call on pretty well any file-like object, such as <TT>ARGF</TT><A name="input and"></A>. It reads the lines of input and passes them, one at a time, to a "block" of following code.</P>
<P class=docList><A name="The following"></A>The following <TT>do</TT><A name="block getting"></A> says that the block getting the input stretches from there to the corresponding <TT>end</TT>, and the <TT>|line|</TT> asks that the <TT>each_line</TT><A name="line into"></A> method load each line into the variable <TT>line</TT><A name="it to"></A> before giving it to the block.</P>
<P class=docList><A name="loop may"></A>This kind of loop may surprise the eyes of a new convert to Ruby, but it's concise, powerful, and very easy to follow after just a bit of practice.</P></DD>

<P><SPAN class=docPubcolor><SPAN class=docEmphasis>Line 2</SPAN> </SPAN></P></DT>
<DD>
<P class=docList><A name="the "></A>This is a pretty straightforward if statement. The only magic is the =~, which means "matches" and expects to be followed by <A name=idx-CHP-4-0162></A><A name="can tell"></A>regular expression. You can tell Ruby that something is a regular expression by putting slashes before and after it—for example, <TT>/this-is-a-regex/</TT><A name="expression we"></A>. But the particular regular expression we want to use is full of slashes. So to use the slash syntax, you'd have to "escape" them by turning each / into \/, which would be ugly. In this case, therefore, the %r trick produces more beautiful code.</P></DD>

<P><SPAN class=docPubcolor><SPAN class=docEmphasis>Line 3</SPAN> </SPAN></P></DT>

<P class=docList>We're inside the <TT>if</TT> block now. So, if the current <TT>line</TT> matches the regexp, the program executes <TT>puts line</TT><A name="and a"></A>, which prints out the line and a line feed.</P></DD>

<P class=docText>So far, we've shown how <A name=idx-CHP-4-0165></A><A name="be used"></A>regular expressions can be used to find the lines in the logfile that we're interested in.

<P class=docText><A name="to work"></A>Before we go to work determining the popularity of different articles, I'd like to argue that in some important ways, this code is beautiful. Take a moment and think of the code you'd have to write to look at an arbitrary chunk of text and do the same matching and selection work done by the parenthesized regexp. It would be quite a few lines of code, and it would be easy to get wrong. Furthermore, if the format of the logfile changed, fixing the pattern matcher would be error-prone and irritating.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the way"></A>Under the covers, the way that <A name=idx-CHP-4-0167></A><A name="is also"></A>regular expressions work is also among the more wonderful things in computer science. It turns out that they can conveniently be translated into <A name=idx-CHP-4-0168></A>finite <A name=idx-CHP-4-0169></A><A name="for matching"></A>automata. These automata are mathematically elegant, and there are astoundingly efficient algorithms for matching them against the text you're <A name=idx-CHP-4-0170></A><A name="thing is"></A>searching. The great thing is that when you're running an automaton, you have to look only once at each character in the text you're trying to match. The effect is that a well-built regular expression engine can do pattern matching and selection faster than almost any custom code, even if it were written in hand-optimized assembly language. That's beautiful.</P>
<P class=docText>I think that the <A name=idx-CHP-4-0171></A><A name="Nearly every"></A>Ruby code is pretty attractive, too. Nearly every character of the <A name=idx-CHP-4-0172></A><A name="that there"></A>program is doing useful work. Note that there are no semicolons on the ends of the lines, nor parentheses around the conditional block, and that you can write <TT><A name="puts line"></A>puts line</TT> instead of <TT>puts(line)</TT><A name="kind of"></A>. Also, variables aren't declared—they're just used. This kind of <A name=idx-CHP-4-0173></A><A name="for programs"></A>stripped-down language design makes for programs that are shorter and easier to write, as well as (more important) easier to read and easier to understand.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="terms of"></A>Thinking in terms of time, <A name=idx-CHP-4-0174></A><A name="a win"></A>regular expressions are a win/win. It takes the programmer way less time to write them than the equivalent code, it takes less time to deliver the program to the people waiting for it, it uses the computer really efficiently, and the program's user spends less time sitting there bored.</P><A name=content-addressable_storage></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0EEEDK>4.2.3. Content-Addressable Storage</H4>
<P class=docText><A name="have to"></A>Now we're approaching the core of our problem, computing the popularity of articles.

The idea is to put the key in and get the value out.

<P class=docText><A name="news is"></A>The good news is that you, the programmer, using any modern computer language, have access to excellent software implementations of associative memory. Different languages call these implementations different things. Often they are implemented as <A name=idx-CHP-4-0180></A>hash tables; in Java, Perl, and <A name=idx-CHP-4-0181></A><A name="are called"></A>Ruby, which use this technique, they are called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Hashes, HashMaps</SPAN><A name=called></A>, or something similar. In Python, they are called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>dictionaries</SPAN><A name="and in"></A>, and in the computer algebra language Maple, simply <SPAN class=docEmphasis>tables</SPAN>.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="eager search"></A>Now if you're an eager search-algorithm fan just itching to write your own super-efficient search, this may sound like bad news, not good news. But think about those flavors of time; if you use the built-in associative store, the amount of programmer time and management invested in writing search algorithms goes to nearly zero.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="own search"></A>By writing your own search, you <SPAN class=docEmphasis>might</SPAN><A name="to save"></A> be able to save a little computer (and thus end-user) time, compared to the built-in version, but on the other hand, you might not; the people who write these things tend to be pretty clever.

<P class=docText><A name="beautiful to"></A>Line 10 looks a little less beautiful to me than most <A name=idx-CHP-4-0187></A><A name=Ruby></A>Ruby <A name=idx-CHP-4-0188></A><A name="to understand"></A>code, but it's easy enough to understand. The <TT>keys</TT> method of <TT>counts</TT><A name="containing all"></A> returns an array containing all of the Hash's keys. Because of the hash implementation, the keys are stored in no predictable order, and are also returned by the <TT>keys</TT><A name="random order"></A> method in random order. So, I have to sort them and store them back in a new array.</P>
<P class=docText>In Ruby, <TT>sort</TT><A name="a code"></A> is accompanied by a code block, here enclosed in curly braces. (In Ruby, you can delimit a block either with <TT>do</TT> and <TT>end</TT><A name="forth through"></A> or with { and }.) The sort works its way back and forth through the array being sorted, passing pairs of elements to the block, which has to return a negative number, 0, or a positive number depending on whether the first element is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="we want"></A>In this case, we want to get the data out of the hash in an order defined by the values (the counts themselves) rather than by the filenames (the keys), so we have to sort the keys by their values. Have a close look at the code, and you'll see how it works. Because this is something that people do all the time, I'm surprised that Ruby's Hash doesn't come with <TT>sort_by_value</TT>.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="order for"></A>We use a decreasing order for the sort so that, no matter how many articles we've found, we know the first 10 items in <TT>keys_by_count</TT> represent the top 10 articles in popularity.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="array of"></A>Now that we have an array of keys (article names) sorted in descending order of how many times they've been fetched, we can accomplish our assignment by printing out the first 10. Line 11 is simple, but a word is in order about that <TT>each</TT><A name="In Ruby"></A> method. In Ruby, you almost never see a <TT>for</TT><A name="whose elements"></A> statement because anything whose elements you might want to loop through has an <TT>each</TT><A name="it for"></A> method that does it for you.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="be a"></A>Line 12 may be a little hard to read for the non-Rubyist because of the #{} syntax, but it's pretty straightforward.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="our first"></A>So, let's declare victory on our first assignment. It took us only 13 lines of easy-to-read code. A seasoned Rubyist would have squeezed the last three lines into one.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="it over"></A>Let's run this thing and see what it reports. Instead of running it over the whole 28 GB, let's just use it on a week's data: a mere 1.2 million records comprising 245 MB.</P><PRE>	~/dev/bc/ 548&gt; <B>zcat ~/ongoing/logs/2006-12-17.log.gz | \

<P class=docText><A name="took place"></A>This run took place on my 1.67 GHz Apple PowerBook. The results are unsurprising, but the program does seem kind of slow. Should we worry about performance?</P><A name=time_to_optimize></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0E3ODK>4.2.4. Time to Optimize?</H4>
<P class=docText><A name="my sample"></A>I was wondering whether my sample run was really unreasonably slow, so I pulled together a very similar program in Perl, a language that is less beautiful than Ruby but is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>extremely</SPAN><A name="half the"></A> fast. Sure enough, the Perl version took half the time. So, should we try to optimize?</P>
<P class=docText><A name="We need"></A>We need to think about time again. Yes, we might be able to make this run faster, and thus reduce the program execution time and the time a user spends waiting for it, but to do this we'd have to burn some of the programmer's time, and thus the time the user waits for the programmer to get the program written. In most cases, my instinct would be that 13.54 seconds to process a week's data is OK, so I'd declare victory. But let's suppose we're starting to get gripes from people who use the program, and we'd like to make it run faster.</P>
<P class=docText>Glancing over <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('reporting_the_most_popular_articles');">Example 4-4</A><A name="that the"></A>, we can see that the program falls into two distinct parts. First, it reads all the lines and tabulates the fetches; then it sorts them to find the top 10.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="opportunity here"></A>There's an obvious optimization opportunity here: why bother sorting all the fetch tallies when all we really want to do is pick the top 10? It's easy enough to write a little code to run through the array once and pick the 10 highest elements.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="I found"></A>Would that help? I found out by instrumenting the program to find out how much time it spent doing its two tasks. The answer was (averaging over a few runs) 7.36 seconds in the first part and 0.07 in the second. Which is to say, "No, it wouldn't help."</P>
<P class=docText><A name="worthwhile to"></A>Might it be worthwhile to try to optimize the first part? Probably not; all it does is match regular expressions, and store and retrieve data using a Hash, and these are among the most heavily optimized parts of Ruby.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="time of"></A>So, getting fancy in replacing that sort would probably waste the time of the programmer and the customer waiting for the code, without saving any noticeable amount of computer or waiting-user time. Also, experience would teach that you're not apt to go much faster than Perl does for this kind of task, so the amount of speedup you're going to get is pretty well bounded.<A name=I_indexterm4_tt40></A><A name=I_indexterm4_tt41></A><A name=I_indexterm4_tt42></A><A name=I_indexterm4_tt43></A><A name=I_indexterm4_tt44></A></P>

<P class=docText><A name="credit where"></A>In the spirit of credit where credit is due, the notion of getting real work done by scanning lines of textual input using regular expressions and using a content-addressable store to build up results was first popularized in the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>awk</SPAN><A name="surnames of"></A> programming language, whose name reflects the surnames of its inventors Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan.<A name=idx-CHP-4-0193></A><A name=idx-CHP-4-0194></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="This work"></A>This work, of course, was based on the then-radical Unix philosophy—due mostly to Ritchie and Thompson—that data should generally be stored in files in lines of text, and to some extent validated the philosophy.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the ideas"></A>Larry Wall took the ideas behind <SPAN class=docEmphasis>awk</SPAN><A name=of></A> and, as the author of <A name=idx-CHP-4-0195></A><A name="into a"></A>Perl, turned them into a high-performance, industrial-strength, general-purpose tool that doesn't get the credit it deserves. It served as the glue that has held together the world's Unix systems, and subsequently large parts of the first-generation Web.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><BR></DIV></DIV>
