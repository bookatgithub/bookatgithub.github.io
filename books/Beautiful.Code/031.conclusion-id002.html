<P class=docText><A name="It is"></A>It is hard to imagine any computer application that does not involve storing data and finding it based on its content. The world's single most popular computer application, web search, is a notable example.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="considered some"></A>This chapter has considered some of the issues, notably bypassing the traditional "database" domain and the world of search strategies that involve external storage. Whether operating at the level of a single line of text or billions of web documents, search is central. From the programmer's point of view, it also needs to be said that implementing searches of one kind or another is, among other things, fun.</P></DIV></DIV>
