<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>5.9. The Moral of the Story</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="If there"></A>If there's a moral to this story, it is this: do not let performance considerations stop you from doing what is right. You can always make the code faster with a little cleverness. You can rarely recover so easily from a bad design.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="faster over"></A>Programs usually become faster over time, not slower. Faster CPUs are a part of that process, but not the most important. Improved algorithms are a much bigger contributor. Therefore, design the program you want in the way it should be designed. Then, and only then, should you worry about performance. More often than not, you'll discover the program is fast enough on your first pass, and you won't even need to play tricks like those outlined here. However, when you do, it's much easier to make beautiful-but-slow code fast than it is to make fast-but-ugly code beautiful.<A name=I_indexterm5_tt47></A></P></DIV></DIV>
