<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>6.2. The Challenge of Framework Design</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="the architecture"></A>OK, that's the architecture of <A name=idx-CHP-6-0291></A><A name="makes it"></A>FIT. Let's talk about what makes it different.<A name=idx-CHP-6-0292></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="The hardest"></A>Framework design is tough. The hardest thing about it is that you have no control over code that uses your framework. Once you've published your framework's API, you can't change the signatures of particular methods or change their semantics without forcing some work on the users of the framework. And, typically, framework users do not like to revisit their code when they upgrade; they want complete backward-compatibility.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="way of"></A>The traditional way of handling this problem is to adopt certain rules of thumb:</P>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<OL class=docList type=1>
<LI>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
<P class=docList><A name="about what"></A>Be very careful about what you make public: control visibility to keep the published parts of the framework small.</P></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
<P class=docList>Use interfaces.</P></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
<P class=docList><A name="it to"></A>Provide well-defined "hook points" that permit extensibility in the places where you intend it to occur.</P></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
<P class=docList><A name="in places"></A>Prevent extension in places where you don't want it to occur.</P></DIV></LI></OL></DIV>
<P class=docText><A name="have been"></A>Some of these guidelines have been written down in various places,<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('CHP-6-FNOTE-2');">[<IMG alt=dagger src="images/U2020.GIF">]</A></SUP><A name="They are"></A> but, for the most part, they are cultural. They are just common ways that framework developers design.</P>

<P class=docText><A name="an example"></A>Let's look at an example outside of FIT that shows those rules in action: the JavaMail API.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to receive"></A>If you want to receive mail using JavaMail, you have to get a reference to a <TT>Session</TT> object. <TT>Session</TT> is a class that has a static method named <TT>getDefaultInstance</TT>:<A name=idx-CHP-6-0293></A></P><PRE>	package javax.mail;
	
	public final class Session
	{
	   ...
	   public static Session getDefaultInstance(Properties props);
	   ...
	   public Store getStore( ) throws NoSuchProviderException;
	   ...
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>The <TT>Session</TT><A name=of></A> class is final. In Java, this means that we cannot create subclasses of <TT>Session</TT>. Furthermore, <TT>Session</TT><A name="public constructor"></A> doesn't have a public constructor, so we can't create an instance ourselves; we have to use that static method to get an instance.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="we can"></A>Once we have a session, we can use the <TT>getStore</TT> method to get a <TT>Store</TT><A name="of received"></A>: an object that contains folders of received mail and a few other helpful things.</P>
<P class=docText><TT>Store</TT><A name="is an"></A> is an abstract class. The JavaMail framework supplies a couple of subclasses of <TT>Store</TT><A name="we don"></A>, but as users we don't have to care which one is returned to us; we just accept it and use it to get our mail. If we want to be notified when the framework changes the store, we can register a listener on the store instance using this method:<A name=idx-CHP-6-0294></A></P><PRE>	public abstract class Store extends javax.mail.Service {
	    ...
	    public void addStoreListener(StoreListener <A name=idx-CHP-6-0295></A>listener);
	    ...
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="of the"></A>This little portion of the JavaMail framework epitomizes traditional framework style. The <TT>Session</TT><A name="declared as"></A> class is declared as final to prevent subclassing. JavaMail also uses an abstract class, <TT>Store</TT><A name="point of"></A>, to provide a point of extension: there can be many kinds of stores.</P>
<P class=docText>However, <TT>Store</TT><A name=have></A> is a guarded extension point. There is no programmatic way to have <TT>Session</TT><A name=different></A> return a different <TT>Store</TT><A name="be configured"></A> object. The returned Store can be configured, but not in the code. The framework has locked down that choice.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="register a"></A>On the other hand, you can register a listener on the <TT>Store</TT><A name="This listener"></A>. This listener is a little "hook point" defined by the framework developers so that users can receive notifications about things that happen on the store without having to subclass <TT>Store</TT> themselves.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Java Mail"></A>All in all, the Java Mail API protects itself very well. You have to go through a well-defined sequence of steps to use it, and the framework developers have "cover" for future change; they can go back and change anything they want to in the internals of the <TT>Session</TT><A name="about someone"></A> class without worrying about someone subclassing and overriding particular pieces of it.</P></DIV></DIV>
