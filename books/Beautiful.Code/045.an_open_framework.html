<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>6.3. An Open Framework</H3>
<P class=docText><A name=idx-CHP-6-0296></A><A name="FIT is"></A>FIT is a very different kind of framework. You might have noticed from the UML diagram in <A class=docLink href="043.an_acceptance_testing_framework_in_three_classes.html#relations_among_fit_classes">Figure 6-3</A><A name="in the"></A> that nearly everything in the core framework is public, even the data. If you glance though the code of other popular frameworks, you'll find nothing quite like it. How could this possibly work? It works because FIT is an example of an open framework. It doesn't have a small set of designed extension points; the entire framework was designed to be extensible.<A name=idx-CHP-6-0297></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="at the"></A>Let's take a look at the <TT>Fixture</TT><A name=the></A> class. Clients of the <TT>Fixture</TT><A name="in a"></A> class use it in a very direct way. They create an instance of <TT>Fixture</TT>, create a parse tree for an HTML document using <TT>Parse</TT>, and then pass the tree to the <TT>doTables</TT> method. The <TT>doTables</TT> method then calls <TT>doTable</TT> for each table in the document, passing along the appropriate parse subtree.<A name=idx-CHP-6-0298></A></P>
<P class=docText>The <TT>doTable</TT> method looks like this:</P><PRE>	public void doTable(Parse table) {
	    doRows(table.parts.more);
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>And the method it calls, <TT>doRows</TT>, looks like this:</P><PRE>	public void <A name=idx-CHP-6-0299></A>doRows(<A name=idx-CHP-6-0300></A>Parse rows) {
	    while (rows != null) {
	        doRow(rows);
	        rows = rows.more;
	    }
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>The <TT>doRow</TT> method, in turn, calls <TT>doCells</TT>:</P><PRE>	public void doRow(Parse row) {
	    <A name=idx-CHP-6-0301></A>doCells(row.parts);
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>And the sequence bottoms out in a method called <TT>doCell</TT>:</P><PRE>	public void doCell(Parse cell, int columnNumber) {
	    <A name=idx-CHP-6-0302></A>ignore(cell);
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>The <TT>ignore</TT><A name="the cell"></A> method simply adds the color gray to the cell, indicating that the cell has been ignored:</P><PRE>	public static void ignore (Parse cell) {
	    cell.addToTag(" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"");
	    ignores++;
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="look like"></A>As defined, it doesn't look like <TT>Fixture</TT><A name="at all"></A> does much of anything at all. All it does is traverse a document and turn cells gray. However, subclasses of <TT>Fixture</TT><A name="methods and"></A> can override any of those methods and do different things. They can gather information, save information, communicate with the application under test, and mark cell values. <TT>Fixture</TT><A name="defines the"></A> defines the default sequence for traversing an HMTL document.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="very un"></A>This is a very un-framework-y way of doing things. Users don't "plug into" this frame-work; they subclass a class and override some default actions. Also, there's no real cover for the framework designer. Technically, all a user needs to call is the <TT>doTables</TT><A name="traversal sequence"></A> method, but the entire traversal sequence, from <TT>doTables</TT> down to <TT>doCell</TT>, is public. <A name=idx-CHP-6-0303></A><A name="have to"></A>FIT will have to live with that traversal sequence forever. There's no way to change it without breaking client code. From a traditional framework perspective, this is bad, but what if you are confident in the traversal sequence? The sequence mirrors the parts of HTML that we care about, and it's very stable; it's hard to imagine HTML changing in a way that would break it. Living with it forever might be OK.</P></DIV></DIV>
