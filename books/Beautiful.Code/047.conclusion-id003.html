<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>6.5. Conclusion</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="Many of"></A>Many of us in the industry have learned our lessons through the school of hard knocks. We've run into situations where software we've written earlier is not as extensible as we wish. Over time, we've reacted by gathering rules of thumb that attempt to preserve <A name=idx-CHP-6-0316></A><A name="If you"></A>extensibility by restricting choices. If you are developing a framework and you have thousands of users, this may be the best thing that you can do, but it isn't the only way.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="FIT demonstrates"></A>The alternative that FIT demonstrates is radical: try to make the framework as flexible and concise as you can, not by factoring it into dozens of classes but by being very careful about how each class is factored internally. You make methods public so that when users want to stray from the normal course, they can, but you also make some hard choices, like FIT's choice of <A name=idx-CHP-6-0317></A><A name="a medium"></A>HTML as a medium.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="a framework"></A>If you design a framework like this, you end with a very different piece of software. Once the classes are <A name=idx-CHP-6-0318></A><A name="but what"></A>opened up, it will be hard to change them in future releases, but what you produce may be small and understandable enough to lead people to create something new.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="a trivial"></A>And that isn't a trivial feat. The world is filled with frameworks that are a little too hard to understand and look like they have a bit too much investment in them—so much investment that it's hard to justify reinventing the wheel. When that happens, we end up with large frameworks that miss important areas of use.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to say"></A>Putting frameworks aside, there's a lot to say for adopting this "open" style of development in small projects. If you know all of the users of your code—if, for instance, they all sit with you on the same project—you can choose to lower the defenses in some of your code and make it as simple and clean as FIT's code.<A name=I_indexterm6_tt63></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="easy for"></A>Not all code is API code. It's easy for us to forget this because we hear the horror stories (the cases when one team locks down another by silently introducing dependencies that can't be eradicated), but if you are one team—if the clients of your code can and will make changes when you ask them to—you can adopt a different style of development and move toward quite open code. Language-based protection and design-based protection are solutions to a problem, but the problem is social, and it's important to consider whether you really have it or not.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Every once"></A>Every once in a while, I show FIT's code to an experienced developer, and I get an interesting reaction. They immediately say, "Nice, but I would never write code like that." At that point, I ask them to ask themselves why. To me, FIT is a beautiful framework because it leads to that question and invites us to reflect on our answers.<A name=I_indexterm6_tt64></A></P></DIV></DIV>
