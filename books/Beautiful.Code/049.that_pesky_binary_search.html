<H2 class=docChapterTitle id=title-ID0EH1CK>7. Beautiful Tests</H2>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="Alberto Savoia"></A>Alberto Savoia</SPAN> <A name=idx-CHP-7-0319></A></P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphSmaller><A name="had the"></A>Most programmers have had the experience of looking at a piece of code</SPAN><A name="was not"></A> and thinking it was not only functional but also <SPAN class=docEmphasis>beautiful</SPAN><A name="typically considered"></A>. Code is typically considered beautiful if it does what it's supposed to do with unique elegance and economy.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the tests"></A>But what about the tests for that beautiful code—especially the kind of tests that developers write, or <SPAN class=docEmphasis>should</SPAN><A name="going to"></A> write, while they are working on the code? In this chapter, I am going to focus on tests, because tests can be beautiful themselves. More importantly, they can play a key role in helping you create more beautiful code.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="will see"></A>As we will see, a combination of things makes tests beautiful. Unlike code, I can't bring myself to consider any <SPAN class=docEmphasis>single</SPAN><A name="the same"></A> test beautiful—at least not in the same way I can look at, say, a sorting routine and call it beautiful. The reason is that <A name=idx-CHP-7-0320></A><A name="combinatorial and"></A>testing, by its very nature, is a combinatorial and exploratory problem. Every <TT>if</TT><A name="statement in"></A> statement in the code requires at least two tests (one test for when the condition evaluates to true and one when it evaluates to false). An <TT>if</TT><A name="such as"></A> statement with multiple conditions, such as:</P><PRE>	if ( a || b || c )
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="to eight"></A>could require, in theory, up to eight tests—one for each possible combination of the values of <TT>a, b</TT>, and <TT>c</TT><A name="control loops"></A>. Throw in control loops, multiple input parameters, dependencies on external code, different hardware and software platforms, etc., and the number and types of tests needed increases considerably.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="or not"></A>Any nontrivial code, beautiful or not, needs not one, but a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>team</SPAN><A name="specific aspect"></A> of tests, where each test should be focused on checking a specific aspect of the code, similar to the way different players on a sports team are responsible for different tasks and different areas of the playing field.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="we have"></A>Now that we have determined that we should evaluate tests in groups, we need to determine what characteristics would make a group of tests <SPAN class=docEmphasis>beautiful</SPAN>—an adjective rarely applied to them.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of tests"></A>Generally speaking, the main purpose of tests is to instill, reinforce, or reconfirm our confidence that the code works properly and efficiently. Therefore, to me, the most beautiful tests are those that help me maximize my confidence that the code does, and will continue to do, what it's supposed to. Because different types of tests are needed to verify different properties of the code, the basic criteria for <A name=idx-CHP-7-0321></A><A name="ways tests"></A>beauty vary. This chapter explores three ways tests can be beautiful:</P><A name=idx-CHP-7-0322></A>
<DL class=docList>
<DT><BR>
<P><SPAN class=docPubcolor><SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="Tests that"></A>Tests that are beautiful for their simplicity</SPAN> </SPAN></P></DT>
<DD>
<P class=docList><A name="lines of"></A>With a few lines of test code, I can document and verify the target code's basic behavior. By automatically running those tests with every build, I can ensure that the intended behavior is preserved as the code evolves. This chapter uses the JUnit <A name=idx-CHP-7-0322></A><A name="examples of"></A>testing framework for examples of basic tests that take minutes to write and keep paying dividends for the life of the project.</P></DD>
<DT><BR>
<P><SPAN class=docPubcolor><SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="are beautiful"></A>Tests that are beautiful because they reveal ways to make code more elegant, maintainable, and testable</SPAN> </SPAN></P></DT>
<DD>
<P class=docList><A name="that help"></A>In other words, tests that help make code more beautiful. The process of writing tests often helps you realize not only logical problems, but also structural and design issues with your implementation. In this chapter, I demonstrate how, while trying to write tests, I have discovered a way to make my code more robust, readable, and well structured.</P></DD>
<DT><BR>
<P><SPAN class=docPubcolor><SPAN class=docEmphasis>Tests that are beautiful for their breadth and depth</SPAN> </SPAN></P></DT>
<DD>
<P class=docList><A name="code functions"></A>Very thorough and exhaustive tests boost the developer's confidence that the code functions as expected, not only in some basic or handpicked cases, but in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>all</SPAN><A name="shows how"></A> cases. This chapter shows how I write and run this category of tests using the concept of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>test theories</SPAN>.</P></DD></DL>
<P class=docText><A name="already familiar"></A>Because most developers are already familiar with basic testing techniques, such as smoke testing and boundary testing, I will spend most of the time on highly effective types of tests and testing techniques that are seldom discussed and rarely practiced.</P><A name=that_pesky_binary_search></A>
<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>7.1. That Pesky Binary Search</H3>
<P class=docText>To demonstrate various <A name=idx-CHP-7-0323></A><A name="chapter reasonably"></A>testing techniques while keeping this chapter reasonably short, I need an example that's simple to describe and that can be implemented in a few lines of code. At the same time, the example must be juicy enough to provide some interesting testing challenges. Ideally, this example should have a long history of buggy implementations, demonstrating the need for thorough testing. And, last but not least, it would be great if this example itself could be considered beautiful code.<A name=idx-CHP-7-0324></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="hard to"></A>It's hard to talk about beautiful code without thinking about Jon <A name=idx-CHP-7-0325></A>Bentley's classic book <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Programming Pearls</SPAN><A name="rereading the"></A> (Addison-Wesley). As I was rereading the book, I hit the beautiful code example I was looking for: a <A name=idx-CHP-7-0326></A>binary search.<A name=idx-CHP-7-0327></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="a binary"></A>As a quick refresher, a binary search is a simple and effective algorithm (but, as we'll see, tricky to implement correctly) to determine whether a presorted array of numbers <TT><I>x[0..n-1]</I></TT><A name="target element"></A> contains a target element <TT><I>t</I></TT><A name=contains></A>. If the array contains <TT><I>t</I></TT>, the program returns its position in the array; otherwise, it returns <TT>-1</TT>.</P>
<P class=docText>Here's how Jon Bentley described the algorithm to the students:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText><A name="range within"></A>Binary search solves the problem by keeping track of the range within the array that holds t (if t is anywhere in the array). Initially, the range is the entire array. The range is shrunk by comparing its middle element to t and discarding half the range. The process continues until t is discovered in the array or until the range in which it must lie is known to be empty.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText>He adds:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText><A name="think that"></A>Most programmers think that with the above description in hand, writing the code is easy. They are wrong. The only way to believe this is by putting down this column right now and writing the code yourself. Try it.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText><A name="have never"></A>I second Bentley's suggestion. If you have never implemented binary search, or haven't done so in a few years, I suggest you try that yourself before going forward; it will give you greater appreciation for what follows.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="example because"></A>Binary search is a great example because it's so simple and yet it's so easy to implement incorrectly. In <SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="Programming Pearls"></A>Programming Pearls</SPAN><A name="over the"></A>, Jon Bentley shares how, over the years, he asked hundreds of professional programmers to implement binary search after providing them with a description of the basic algorithm. He gave them a very generous two hours to write it, and even allowed them to use the high-level language of their choice (including pseudocode). Surprisingly, only about 10 percent of the professional programmers implemented binary search correctly.</P>
<P class=docText>More surprisingly, in his <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Sorting and Searching</SPAN>,<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('CHP-7-FNOTE-1');">[*]</A></SUP><A name="out that"></A> Donald Knuth points out that even though the first binary search was published in 1946, it took 12 more years for the first binary search <SPAN class=docEmphasis>without bugs</SPAN> to be published.</P>

<P class=docText><A name="of all"></A>But most surprising of all is that even Jon Bentley's official and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>proven</SPAN><A name="out to"></A> algorithm, which (I must assume) has been implemented and adapted thousands of times, turns out to have a problem that can manifest itself when the array is big enough and the algorithm is implemented in a language with fixed-precision arithmetic.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="bug manifests"></A>In Java, the bug manifests itself by throwing an <TT>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</TT><A name="an array"></A>, whereas in C, you get an array index out of bounds with unpredictable results. You can read more about this latest bug in Joshua Bloch's blog: <A class=docLink href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html" target=_blank>http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html</A>.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="with the"></A>Here is a Java implementation with the infamous bug:</P><PRE>	public static int buggyBinarySearch(int[] a, int target) {
	    int low = 0;
	    int high = a.length - 1;

	    while (low &lt;= high) {
	        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
	        int midVal = a[mid];

	        if (midVal &lt; target)
	            low = mid + 1;
	        else if (midVal &gt; target)
	            high = mid - 1;
	        else
	            return mid;
	    }
	    return -1;
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="The bug"></A>The bug is in the following line:</P><PRE>	int mid = (low + high) / 2;
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name=of></A>If the sum of <TT>low</TT> and <TT>high</TT> is greater than <TT>Integer.MAX_VALUE</TT> (which is 2<SUP>31</SUP><A name="into a"></A> -1 in Java), it overflows into a negative number and, of course, stays negative when divided by 2—ouch!</P>
<P class=docText><A name="solution is"></A>The recommended solution is to change the calculation of the midpoint to prevent integer overflow. One way to do it is by subtracting instead of adding:</P><PRE>	int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="to show"></A>Or, if you want to show off your knowledge of <A name=idx-CHP-7-0328></A>bit shift operators, the blog (and the official Sun Microsystems bug report<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('CHP-7-FNOTE-2');">[<IMG alt=dagger src="images/U2020.GIF">]</A></SUP><A name="may be"></A>) suggests using the unsigned bit shift, which is probably faster but may be obscure to most Java developers (including me):</P>

<P class=docText><A name="simple the"></A>Considering how simple the idea behind <A name=idx-CHP-7-0329></A><A name="sheer number"></A>binary search is, and the sheer number and collective brain power of the people that have worked on it over the years, it's a great example of why even the simplest code needs <A name=idx-CHP-7-0330></A><A name="this beautifully"></A>testing—and lots of it. Joshua Bloch expressed this beautifully in his blog about this bug:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText><A name="The general"></A>The general lesson that I take away from this bug is humility: It is hard to write even the smallest piece of code correctly, and our whole world runs on big, complex pieces of code.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText><A name="implementation of"></A>Here is the implementation of binary search I want to test. In theory, the fix to the way the <TT>mid</TT><A name="resolve the"></A> is calculated should resolve the final bug in a pesky piece of code that has eluded some of the best programmers for a few decades:</P><PRE>	public static int binarySearch(int[] a, int target) {
	    int low = 0;
	    int high = a.length - 1;

	    while (low &lt;= high) {
	        int mid = (low + high) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
	        int midVal = a[mid];

	        if (midVal &lt; target)
	            low = mid + 1;
	        else if (midVal &gt; target)
	            high = mid - 1;
	        else
	            return mid;
	    }
	    return -1;
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name=of></A>This version of <TT>binarySearch</TT><A name="might still"></A> looks right, but there might still be problems with it. Perhaps not bugs, but things that can and should be changed. The changes will make the code not only more robust, but more readable, maintainable, and testable. Let's see whether we can discover some interesting and unexpected opportunities for improvement as we test it.</P></DIV></DIV>
