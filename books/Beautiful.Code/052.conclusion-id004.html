<P class=docText><A name="In this"></A>In this chapter, we have seen that even the best developers and the most beautiful code can benefit from <A name=idx-CHP-7-0385></A><A name="seen that"></A>testing. We have also seen that writing test code can be every bit as creative and challenging as writing the target code. And, hopefully, I've shown you that tests themselves can be considered beautiful in at least three different ways.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="beautiful for"></A>Some tests are beautiful for their simplicity and efficiency. With a few lines of JUnit code, run automatically with every build, you can document the code's intended behavior and boundaries, and ensure that both of them are preserved as the code evolves.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="are beautiful"></A>Other tests are beautiful because, in the process of writing them, they help you improve the code they are meant to test in subtle but important ways. They may not discover proper bugs or defects, but they bring to the surface problems with the design, testability, or maintainability of the code; they help you make your code more beautiful.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="beautiful for"></A>Finally, some tests are beautiful for their breadth and thoroughness. They help you gain confidence that the functionality and performance of the code match requirements and expectations, not just on a few handpicked examples, but with a wide range of inputs and conditions.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="from artists"></A>Developers who want to write beautiful code can learn something from artists. Painters regularly put down their brushes, step away from the canvas, circle it, cock their heads, squint, and look at it from different angles and under different lights. They need to develop and integrate those perspectives in their quest for beauty. If your canvas is an IDE and your medium is code, think of testing as your way of stepping away from the canvas to look at your work with critical eyes and from different perspectives—it will make you a better programmer and help you create more beautiful code.<A name=I_indexterm7_tt93></A></P></DIV></DIV>
