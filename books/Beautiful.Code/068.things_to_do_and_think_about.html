<P class=docText><A name="The simple"></A>The simple parser shown in this chapter is easily extensible. The tree could be passed to a code generator, or it could be passed to an interpreter. Very little computation is required to produce the tree. And as we saw, very little effort was required to write the programming that built the tree.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=the></A>We could make the <TT>infix</TT><A name="opcode that"></A> function take an opcode that would aid in code generation. We could also have it take additional methods that would be used to do constant folding and code generation.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="add additional"></A>We could add additional statements, such as <TT>for, switch</TT>, and <TT>try</TT><A name="statement labels"></A>. We could add statement labels. We could add more error checking and error recovery. We could add lots more operators. We could add type specification and inference.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="we can"></A>We could make our language extensible. With the same ease that we can define new variables, we can let the programmer add new operators and new statements.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="try the"></A>You can try the demonstration of the parser that was described in this chapter at <A class=docLink href="http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/index.html" target=_blank>http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/index.html</A>.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="parsing technique"></A>Another example of this parsing technique can be found in JSLint at <A class=docLink href="http://jslint.com/" target=_blank>http://JSLint.com</A>.<A name=I_indexterm9_tt200></A><A name=I_indexterm9_tt201></A><A name=I_indexterm9_tt202></A><A name=I_indexterm9_tt203></A></P></DIV></DIV>
