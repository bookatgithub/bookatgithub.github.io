<P class=docText><A name="Another interesting"></A>Another interesting and useful way to compute the <A name=idx-CHP-10-0634></A><A name="a word"></A>population count of a word is based on the "divide and conquer" paradigm. This algorithm might be devised by reasoning, "Suppose I had a way to compute the <A name=idx-CHP-10-0635></A><A name="a "></A>population count of a 16-bit quantity. Then I could run that on the left and right halves of the 32-bit word, and add the results, to obtain the population count of the 32-bit word." This strategy won't pay off if the basic algorithm must be run sequentially on the two halves and it takes time proportional to the number of bits being analyzed, because it would then take 16<SPAN class=docEmphasis>k</SPAN> + 16<SPAN class=docEmphasis>k</SPAN> = 32<SPAN class=docEmphasis>k</SPAN><A name=where></A> units of time, where <SPAN class=docEmphasis>k</SPAN><A name="of proportionality"></A> is the constant of proportionality, plus another instruction for the addition. But if we can somehow do the operation on the two halfwords in parallel, there will be an improvement from, essentially, 32<SPAN class=docEmphasis>k</SPAN> to 16<SPAN class=docEmphasis>k</SPAN> + 1.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="a way"></A>To efficiently compute the population count of two 16-bit quantities, we need a way to do it for 8-bit quantities, and to do 4 of them in parallel. Continuing this reasoning, we need a way to compute the population count of 2-bit quantities, and to do 16 of them in parallel.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to be"></A>The algorithm to be described in no way depends on running operations on separate processors, or on unusual instructions such as the SIMD<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('CHP-10-FNOTE-1');">[*]</A></SUP><A name="It uses"></A>instructions found on some computers. It uses only the facilities usually found on a conventional uniprocessor RISC or CISC.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name=CHP-10-FNOTE-1>[*]</A></SUP><A name="on multiple"></A> Single-instruction, multiple-data instructions are instructions that operate on multiple fields (such as bytes or halfwords) of a computer word in parallel. For example, an 8-bit SIMD <SPAN class=docEmphasis>add</SPAN><A name="might add"></A> might add the corresponding bytes of two words without propagating the carry from one byte to the next.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P class=docText><A name=in></A>The first line in <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('counting_1-bits_divide_and_conquer_strategy');">Figure 10-1</A><A name=word></A> is the word <SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN><A name="wish to"></A> for which we wish to count the number of 1-bits. Each 2-bit field of the second line contains the count of the number of 1-bits in the 2-bit field immediately above. The subscripts are the decimal values of these 2-bit fields. Each 4-bit field in the third line contains the sum of the numbers in two adjacent 2-bit fields of the second line, with the subscripts showing the decimal values, and so forth. The last line contains the number of 1-bits in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>. The algorithm is executed in log<SUB>2</SUB><A name="do the"></A>(32) = 5 steps, where each step contains some shifting and masking instructions to do the addition of adjacent fields.<A name=idx-CHP-10-0637></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="illustrated in"></A>The method illustrated in <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('counting_1-bits_divide_and_conquer_strategy');">Figure 10-1</A><A name="C code"></A> may be committed to C code as follows:</P><PRE>	x = (x &amp; 0x55555555) + ((x &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 0x55555555);
	x = (x &amp; 0x33333333) + ((x &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; 0x33333333);
	x = (x &amp; 0x0F0F0F0F) + ((x &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 0x0F0F0F0F);
	x = (x &amp; 0x00FF00FF) + ((x &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0x00FF00FF);
	x = (x &amp; 0x0000FFFF) + ((x &gt;&gt;16) &amp; 0x0000FFFF);

<P class=docText>(Constants beginning with <TT>0x</TT> <A name=idx-CHP-10-0638></A><A name="line uses"></A>in C are hexadecimal.)

This would cost an instruction if the machine lacks the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>and not</SPAN><A name="applies to"></A> instruction. A similar remark applies to the other lines.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=last></A>Clearly the last <SPAN class=docEmphasis>and</SPAN> is unnecessary because <TT>x &gt;&gt; 16</TT><A name="so the"></A> must begin with 16 0-bits, so the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>and</SPAN> does not alter the value of <TT>x &gt;&gt; 16</TT>. Other <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ands</SPAN><A name="sum will"></A> may be omitted when there is no danger that a field's sum will carry over into the adjacent field. And there is a way to code the first line that uses one less instruction. This leads to the simplification shown in <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('counting_bits_in_a_word');">Example 10-1</A><A name="in "></A>, which executes in 21 instructions and is free of branches and memory references.</P><A name=counting_bits_in_a_word></A>

<P class=docText>Unfortunately, the code of <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('counting_bits_in_a_word');">Example 10-1</A><A name="of the"></A> has lost most of the regularity and elegance of the code from which it was derived. A consequence of this is that it is no longer immediately clear how to extend the code to a 64-bit machine. But it's hard to pass up all those opportunities to save instructions!</P>
<P class=docText><A name=idx-CHP-10-0642></A><A name="conquer is"></A>Divide and conquer is an important technique that should be near the top of every programmer's bag of tricks. And that goes for computer logic designers, too. Other applications of divide and conquer are the well-known technique of binary search, a sorting method known as Quicksort, and a method for reversing the bits of a word.</P></DIV></DIV>
