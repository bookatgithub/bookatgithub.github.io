<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>10.5. Comparing the Population Counts of Two Words</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="Sometimes one"></A>Sometimes one wants to know which of two words has the larger population count, without regard to the actual counts. Can this be determined without doing a population count of the two words? Computing the difference of two population counts, as in <A class=docLink href="073.sum_and_difference_of_population_counts_of_two_words.html#computing_popx_ndash_popy">Example 10-2</A><A name="result to"></A>, and comparing the result to 0, is one way, but there is another way that is preferable if either the population counts are expected to be low, or if there is a strong correlation between the particular bits that are set in the two words.<A name=idx-CHP-10-0650></A><A name=idx-CHP-10-0651></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="to clear"></A>The idea is to clear a single bit in each word until one of the words is all zero; the other word then has the larger population count. The process runs faster in its worst and average cases if the bits that are 1 at the same positions in each word are first cleared. The code is shown in <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('comparing_popx_with_popy');">Example 10-3</A><A name="returns a"></A>. The procedure returns a negative number if pop(<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) &lt; pop(<SPAN class=docEmphasis>y</SPAN>), 0 if pop(<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) = pop(<SPAN class=docEmphasis>y</SPAN><A name="number "></A>), and a positive number (1) if pop(<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) &gt; pop(<SPAN class=docEmphasis>y</SPAN>).</P><A name=comparing_popx_with_popy></A>

<P class=docText><A name="of "></A>After clearing the common 1-bits in each 32-bit word, the maximum possible number of 1-bits in both words together is 32. Therefore the word with the smaller number of 1-bits can have at most 16, and the loop in <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('comparing_popx_with_popy');">Example 10-3</A><A name="a maximum"></A> is executed a maximum of 16 times, which gives a worst case of 119 instructions executed on a basic RISC (16 x 7 + 7). A simulation using uniformly distributed random 32-bit numbers showed that the average <A name=idx-CHP-10-0652></A><A name="word with"></A>population count of the word with the smaller <A name=idx-CHP-10-0653></A><A name="clearing the"></A>population count is approximately 6.186, after clearing the common 1-bits. This gives an average execution time of about 50 instructions when executed on random 32-bit inputs, not as good as using <A class=docLink href="073.sum_and_difference_of_population_counts_of_two_words.html#computing_popx_ndash_popy">Example 10-2</A><A name="For this"></A>. For this procedure to beat that of <A class=docLink href="073.sum_and_difference_of_population_counts_of_two_words.html#computing_popx_ndash_popy">Example 10-2</A><A name="in either"></A>, the number of 1-bits in either <SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> or <SPAN class=docEmphasis>y</SPAN><A name="common "></A>, after clearing the common 1-bits, would have to be three or less.</P></DIV></DIV>
