<P class=docText><A name="none other"></A>I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me. A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate—and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P class=docText><A name="suite of"></A>The group at LFC was working primarily to develop a suite of software designed to protect and enhance <A name=idx-CHP-11-0687></A><A name="in the"></A>individual rights in the digital age, including easy-to-use secure email, online dispute mediation services, an online stock exchange, and a private asset trading and banking system. My interest in many of the same technologies had been piqued long ago by the cypherpunks list and Bruce Schneier's <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Applied Cryptography</SPAN><A name="on prototype"></A> (Wiley), and I'd already been working on prototype implementations of some of these systems.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="were systems"></A>The most fundamental of these were systems to deliver strong and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>usable</SPAN><A name="communications privacy"></A> communications privacy to just about everybody.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="into LFC"></A>When I stepped into LFC's sprawling "interim consulate" outside San José, Costa Rica, they had a working prototype of a secure webmail system they called MailVault. It ran on Mac OS 9, used FileMaker as its database, and was written in Frontier. Not at all the mix of technologies you'd want to run a mission-critical communications service on, but that's what the programmers had produced.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="surprise the"></A>It was no surprise the system crashed early and often, and was extremely fragile. It could hardly support two concurrent users. LFC was facing a credibility crisis with its investors, as their software releases had been delayed many times, and their first beta of MailVault, the flagship product, was no gem. So in the free time left over <A name=idx-CHP-11-0688></A><A name="contract network"></A>from my contract network and system administration work at LFC, I started writing a new <A name=idx-CHP-11-0689></A>secure <A name=idx-CHP-11-0690></A>mail system from scratch.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="now named"></A>This system is now named <A name=idx-CHP-11-0691></A><A name="in between"></A>Cryptonite and has been in constant off-and-on development and testing since then, in between other projects.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="functioning prototype"></A>The first functioning prototype of <A name=idx-CHP-11-0692></A><A name="LFC as"></A>Cryptonite was licensed to LFC as MailVault beta 2, and was open for testing in September 1999. It was the first OpenPGP-compatible webmail system available for public use and was almost immediately put to the test by LFC's investors and beta testers. Since that time, Cryptonite has evolved in many ways through interaction with users, the open source community, and the market. While not an open source product itself, it has led to the development of numerous components I decided to release as open source along the way.</P><A name=the_heart_of_the_start></A>
<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>11.1. The Heart of the Start</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="supporting associated"></A>Developing Cryptonite and marketing and supporting associated services single-handedly for many years (with unwavering support and many invaluable ideas from my wife, Barkha) has been an incredibly interesting and rewarding journey, not only from a development perspective but also from an entrepreneurial one.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Before jumping"></A>Before jumping into the nitty-gritty of the system, I thought I'd touch upon some points that have impressed themselves strongly in my consciousness over the course of this project:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="Ghosh once"></A>My friend Rishab Ghosh once quipped that there's a lot of hype about how the Internet can enable wired hackers to work from anywhere, but most of the people who create this hype live within a small area in California. The great thing about an independent startup project is that it really can be done anywhere, and dropped and picked up again when convenient. I've hacked on Cryptonite over many years on four continents, and it may well be the first high-quality software application developed in large part in the Himalayan mountains. (I used the word "wired" before loosely. In reality, five wireless technologies facilitated our connectivity in the Himalayas: a VSAT satellite Internet link, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS, and CDMA.)</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="a project"></A>When working on a project as a single developer in your spare time, remember the old hacker wisdom that "six months in the lab can save you ten minutes in the library." It's critical to maximize your reuse of existing code libraries. For this reason, I elected to develop the system in Perl, a popular and flexible high-level language with a rich library of mature, free software modules, and the Perl hacker's first virtue of laziness informed every design decision.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="application software"></A>Especially for end-user application software, ease of use is a critical issue. It is essential to the function of such code to present a simple, accessible interface to the user. The usability considerations of developing an end-user security application are even more significant, and were in fact a key factor in making the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0693></A>Cryptonite system worth developing.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="to a"></A>To get off to a running start, it's a good idea to implement a working prototype first, and use a prototype-to-production path to move to production deployment after the essential functionality is implemented. This can be a huge help in getting the basic design and structure right before you unleash the code on hundreds or (hopefully!) millions of users.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="great idea"></A>Keeping your system as simple as possible is always a great idea. Resist the urge to get suckered into using the latest complex buzzword technology, unless the application really demands it.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="pretty fast"></A>Processors are pretty fast now, and programmer time is generally more valuable than processor time, but speed is still critical for application software. Users expect their applications to be snappy. For web applications, which many users will use concurrently, investing some time in optimizing for speed is a Very Good Thing.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="a living"></A>A software application is a living entity, in constant need of attention, updating, enhancement, testing, fixing, tweaking, marketing, and support. Its success and beauty in an economic sense depends directly on the code being flexible enough to evolve over time and meet the requirements of its users, and to do it again and again and again over the course of many years.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="the problem"></A>It really does help if the problem you're trying to solve is something that personally interests you. This not only makes it possible to flip between user and developer roles easily, but ensures you'll still be interested in the project five years later—because building and marketing a software application is generally quite a long-term proposition.</P></LI></UL>
<P class=docText><A name="The development"></A>The development of <A name=idx-CHP-11-0694></A><A name="powered in"></A>Cryptonite has been powered in large measure by my desire to create tools to help individuals all over the world achieve practical liberty. And while developing the system single-handedly has been difficult at times, I find that being a single-developer project has also given the code a certain stylistic and structural unity that's rare in code developed by multiple programmers.</P></DIV></DIV>
