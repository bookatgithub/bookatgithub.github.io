<P class=docText><A name="problem to"></A>The fundamental problem to be solved in practical implementations based on <A name=idx-CHP-11-0699></A>public-key cryptography is <A name=idx-CHP-11-0700></A><A name="an encrypted"></A>key authentication. To send an encrypted message to someone, you need her public key. If you can be tricked into using the wrong public key, your privacy vanishes.</P>
<P class=docText>There are two very different approaches to the key authentication problem.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="depends on"></A>The conventional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) approach, typically based on ISO standard X.509, depends on a system <A name=idx-CHP-11-0701></A>of trusted third-party <A name=idx-CHP-11-0702></A>Certification Authorities (<A name=idx-CHP-11-0703></A><A name="in many"></A>CAs), and is in many ways fundamentally unsuited to meet the real needs of users in ad hoc networks.<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('CHP-11-FNOTE-2');">[<IMG alt=dagger src="images/U2020.GIF">]</A></SUP><A name="significant success"></A> PKI implementations have achieved significant success in more structured domains, such as corporate VPNs and the authentication of <A name=idx-CHP-11-0704></A><A name="little headway"></A>secure web sites, but have made little headway in the real-world heterogeneous <A name=idx-CHP-11-0705></A><A name="email environment"></A>email environment.</P>

<P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name=CHP-11-FNOTE-2>[<IMG alt=dagger src="images/U2020.GIF">]</A></SUP><A name="conventional PKI"></A> The drawbacks of conventional PKI have been concisely summarized by Roger Clarke at <A class=docLink href="http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/II/PKIMisFit.html" target=_blank>http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/II/PKIMisFit.html</A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText><A name="is exemplified"></A>The other approach is exemplified by the most popular public-key-based messaging security solution in use today: Phil <A name=idx-CHP-11-0706></A>Zimmermann's <A name=idx-CHP-11-0707></A><A name="its descendants"></A>PGP and its descendants, now formalized as the IETF <A name=idx-CHP-11-0708></A><A name="the flexibility"></A>OpenPGP protocol. OpenPGP preserves the flexibility and fundamentally decentralized nature of public-key cryptography by facilitating distributed key authentication through "<A name=idx-CHP-11-0709></A><A name="as PKI"></A>webs of trust" rather than depending on a centralized, hierarchical system of CAs, as PKI approaches do (including OpenPGP's primary competitor, S/MIME). Not surprisingly, S/MIME, which is almost ubiquitously available in popular email clients, enjoys a vastly smaller user base than OpenPGP, despite email clients' general lack of comprehensive support for OpenPGP.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="which relies"></A>But the web-of-trust approach, which relies on users to build their own chains of trust for certifying and authenticating public keys, has its own issues. Prime among these are the interrelated challenges of ensuring that users understand how to use the web of trust to authenticate keys, and the need to achieve a critical mass of users in order to ensure that any two users can easily find a trust path between each other.</P>
<P class=docText>As <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('how_keys_are_validated_through_the_web_of_trust');">Figure 11-1</A><A name="trust implementation"></A> shows, in a web of trust implementation, no third parties are arbitrarily designated as "trusted." Each individual user is her own most trusted certifying authority, and may assign varying levels of trust to others for the purpose of validating keys. You consider a key valid if it is certified directly by you, by another person who is fully trusted by you to certify keys, or by a user-definable number of people, each of whom is partially trusted by you to certify keys.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="outsource key"></A>Because the web-of-trust approach doesn't attempt to outsource key authentication the way PKI approaches do, users must play a central role in building their webs of trust and ascertaining the authenticity of public keys. This puts usability considerations front and center in the design of OpenPGP-based secure messaging systems.</P><A name=how_keys_are_validated_through_the_web_of_trust></A>
