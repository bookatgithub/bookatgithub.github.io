<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>11.4. The Foundation</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="Application software"></A>Application software today, of course, is many levels removed from the bare hardware and builds on top of many layers of existing code. So when starting a new project, getting the foundation right has to be the crucial starting point.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of reasons"></A>For a number of reasons, I chose to write <A name=idx-CHP-11-0726></A>Cryptonite in <A name=idx-CHP-11-0727></A><A name="of open"></A>Perl. The rich pool of open source reusable modules on CPAN (<A class=docLink href="http://www.cpan.org/" target=_blank>http://www.cpan.org</A><A name="the need"></A>) helped minimize the need to write new code where existing solutions could be leveraged, and also allowed a great deal of flexibility in interfaces and options. This was borne out well by prior experience with the language as well as by later experiences with the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0728></A>Cryptonite project.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="interface to"></A>The ability to interface to C and other libraries through Perl's XS API allowed access to even more libraries. Perl's excellent portability and robust support for object-oriented programming were other important advantages. Cryptonite was intended to be easily modifiable by licensees, which would also be facilitated by writing it in Perl.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="led to"></A>So, the Cryptonite system is implemented entirely in object-oriented Perl. The project has led to the creation of numerous open source Perl modules, which I have made available on CPAN.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="as the"></A>GNU/Linux jumped out as the obvious development platform, because code developed on a Unix-like environment would be easiest to port to whatever deployment platform it would be used on, which could only be another Unix-like platform. No Windows or <A name=idx-CHP-11-0729></A><A name="time "></A>Mac system at the time (<A name=idx-CHP-11-0730></A><A name="what it"></A>OS X was in pre-beta) had what it took to run mission-critical software to be used concurrently by thousands of users. Linux was my preferred <A name=idx-CHP-11-0731></A><A name="desktop environment"></A>desktop environment anyway, so it was also the default choice.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="deployment moved"></A>In 2001, development and deployment moved to <A name=idx-CHP-11-0732></A><A name="has proceeded"></A>OpenBSD, and since 2003, development has proceeded on OS X and OpenBSD (as well as Linux). OS X was chosen for its out-of-box usability as a portable primary desktop, combined with its Unix-like underpinnings and ability to run a <A name=idx-CHP-11-0733></A><A name="of open"></A>wide variety of open source software. OpenBSD was chosen as a deployment platform for its reliability, superlative security record, and focus on code quality and code auditing.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="for development"></A>The IDE used for development was Emacs, selected for its power, extensibility, and excellent portability, including portability to handheld and wearable devices that I often used for development on the move. I also appreciated the availability of <A name=idx-CHP-11-0734></A>Emacs's <SPAN class=docEmphasis>cperl</SPAN> mode, which manages to offer pretty good auto-formatting for Perl code, even though "only <SPAN class=docEmphasis>perl</SPAN> can parse Perl."</P><A name=design_goals_and_decisions></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0EPGDK>11.4.1. Design Goals and Decisions</H4>
<P class=docText>Cryptonite was envisioned as an OpenPGP-compatible <A name=idx-CHP-11-0735></A>webmail system designed to be <A name=idx-CHP-11-0736></A><A name="of the"></A>secure, scalable, reliable, and easy to use. Portability and extensibility were other important goals of the project.<A name=idx-CHP-11-0737></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="decision made"></A>A key decision made early on was to develop a fully independent core engine to facilitate interface diversity and cross-platform access. It was important for interface specialists to be able to build interfaces without needing to modify the core. Clean separation of the core from the interface would allow experimentation with a variety of interface styles, which could then be subjected to usability testing to help evolve the optimal interface. This separation is also the essential design feature that will enable a diversity of interfaces to be built in the future, including interfaces designed for small devices such as cellphones and PDAs.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="a client"></A>This design called for a client-server system, with a well-defined internal API and a clear separation of functionality and privilege between the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0738></A><A name="Interfaces to"></A>Cryptonite engine and the user interface. Interfaces to the core could then be implemented in any language with any UI framework. A reference interface would be developed to enable live usability testing.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Another consideration"></A>Another consideration was to enable flexibility in deployment, by providing the option to perform cryptographic operations either on the server or on the user's own machine. Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks.</P>
<P class=docText>While in <A name=idx-CHP-11-0739></A><A name="desirable to"></A>principle it is desirable to restrict cryptographic operations to the user's machine, these machines in practice are very often physically <A name=idx-CHP-11-0740></A><A name="with spyware"></A>insecure and riddled with spyware. The server, on the other hand, can benefit from both high physical security and dedicated software maintenance by experts, making server-side cryptography (especially in conjunction with hardware token authentication) a more secure option for many users. This was another reason behind the choice of Perl as the implementation language: its high portability would make it possible to run the application (or components of it) on both server and user machines, as needed.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="would help"></A>An object-oriented implementation would help keep the code easy to comprehend, extend, maintain, and modify over many years. As the code would be available in source form to licensees and end users, readability and accessibility of the code were themselves important objectives.</P><A name=basic_system_design></A>

The methods of this class simply perform operations based on their arguments and return a status code and the results of the operation, if any. All the methods are noninteractive, and there is no user interface code in this class:</P><PRE>	package <A name=idx-CHP-11-0746></A>Cryptonite::Mail::Service;

<P class=docText><A name="functionality of"></A>Cryptonite::Mail::Service encapsulates all the core functionality of the system, including user creation and management; creating, opening and closing folders; sending, deleting and copying mail; encryption, decryption and signature verification; and parsing multipart MIME messages.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=by></A>The Service class is used by <A name=idx-CHP-11-0747></A><A name="to implement"></A>Cryptonite::Mail::Server to implement a server that receives serialized Cryptonite API calls and dispatches them to a Service object.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=idx-CHP-11-0748></A><A name="achieved via"></A>Serialization was initially achieved via SOAP calls, but the SOAP object parsing and handling added too much needless complexity and overhead. So, a simple home-brewed serialization scheme was implemented instead. (Seven years in, this looks like a really good move, judging from <A class=docLink href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/15/the-s-stands-for-simple" target=_blank>http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/15/the-s-stands-for-simple</A><A name="is the"></A> and its comments.)
