<P class=docText><A name="Through "></A>Through 2000 and 2001 I was able to work on <A name=idx-CHP-11-0804></A><A name="because of"></A>Cryptonite only intermittently, both because of other commitments and because the project needed peace and quiet, which was in limited supply when I was traveling around and living in chaotic, cacophonous, polluted Indian cities.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of "></A>In the summer of 2002, my wife and I took a vacation in the Himalayas, where I finally managed to get the time to finish writing major chunks of the code, including adding important <A name=idx-CHP-11-0805></A><A name="abilities to"></A>key management abilities to Crypt::GPG, and creating an <A name=idx-CHP-11-0806></A><A name="key management"></A>integrated interface for key management, which is a critical part of the whole web-of-trust mechanism. The core of this management interface, the Edit Key dialog, is shown in <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('the_edit_key_dialog');">Figure 11-5</A><A name="and the"></A>. It enables fingerprint verification, the viewing and creation of user identity certifications, and the assigning of trust values to keys.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="ported the"></A>I also ported the system over to OpenBSD, which would be the ultimate deployment platform.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the other"></A>We already had all the other major components for a <A name=idx-CHP-11-0807></A><A name="as it"></A>secure email service in place, and as it would still take some time to get <A name=idx-CHP-11-0808></A><A name="Cryptonite ready"></A>Cryptonite ready for public use, we decided to go ahead and launch a commercial secure email service right away. This would enable me to spend more time on Cryptonite development, and to begin building a community of testers immediately.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="launched the"></A>So in mid-2003, we launched the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0809></A><A name="SMTP email"></A>Neomailbox secure IMAP, POP3, and SMTP email service. In the following years, this proved to be an excellent move that would help fund development, freeing me from the need to take on other contract work and simultaneously keeping me in close touch with the market for secure, private messaging.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="fall of"></A>In the fall of 2003, we set up a semi-permanent development base in a small Himalayan hamlet, about 2000 meters above sea level, and this is primarily where development has progressed since then. This kept our cash burn low, which is critical for a bootstrapping startup, and gave me lots of time and peace to work on Neomailbox and Cryptonite.</P><A name=the_edit_key_dialog></A>

<P class=docText><A name="systems from"></A>Even though we had our share of trials working on mission-critical high-tech systems from a remote Himalayan village that was, for the most part, still stuck in the 19th century, the words of Nikolai Roerich, the prolific Russian artist, writer, and philosopher who lived in the same part of the Himalayas for many years, did to a large extent hold true for us, too: "In truth, only here, only in the Himalayas, exist the unique, unprecedented, calm conditions for achieving results."</P><A name=securing_the_code></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0EHHDK>11.8.1. Securing the Code</H4>
<P class=docText><A name="code was"></A>Originally the code was designed as a prototype, and I didn't worry about securing it too much. But as time to make the system available as a public beta came around, it was time to lock down the code with, at least:<A name=idx-CHP-11-0810></A></P>

<P class=docList><A name="security issues"></A>Documentation of any potential security issues</P></LI></UL>
<P class=docText><A name="in from"></A>Privilege separation was already built in from the ground up, by running <SPAN class=docEmphasis>cmaild</SPAN><A name="as a"></A> as a privileged user and interacting with it via its API. This allowed <SPAN class=docEmphasis>cmaild</SPAN><A name="operations such"></A> to perform privileged operations such as modifying system configuration files and performing cryptographic operations in a controlled manner, without giving the web server process access to sensitive resources. Only a few areas required cleanup of the separation between the core and the interface.<A name=idx-CHP-11-0811></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="was the"></A>One of these was the composition of MIME messages with binary attachments. When the code was built using Persistence::Object::Simple, the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>cmaild</SPAN><A name="been circumvented"></A> protocol had been circumvented <A name=idx-CHP-11-0812></A>for <A name=idx-CHP-11-0813></A><A name="Attachments uploaded"></A>binary MIME message composition. Attachments uploaded by the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0814></A>user were saved in a temporary directory, which both <SPAN class=docEmphasis>cmaild</SPAN><A name="to run"></A> and the web server process had access to. Thus, it was necessary to run <SPAN class=docEmphasis>cmaild</SPAN> and the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0815></A><A name="interface on"></A>Cryptonite web interface on the same server.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="it became"></A>With the move to Persistence::Object::Postgres, it became possible to easily pass binary objects between the frontend and the backend via the database, without relying on direct filesystem operations. This was important because the interface, the database, and the Cryptonite engine were all intended to run on their own independent servers or in load-balancing clusters.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=idx-CHP-11-0816></A><A name="of user"></A>Input validation (to check the validity of user-supplied inputs, such as folder and message identifiers) was straightforward to add. The <A name=idx-CHP-11-0817></A><A name="very slightly"></A>Params::Validate module, very slightly modified, was used to add input validation to every method of Cryptonite::Mail::Service. The <TT>mvmsgs</TT><A name="inputs with"></A> method, for example, validates its inputs with:</P><PRE>	sub mvmsgs  {    #      Move a list of messages to some other mailbox.
	  my ($self, $username, $key, $dest, $copy, @msgnums) =
	    (shift, lc shift, shift);

<P class=docText><A name="input for"></A>The acceptability of user-supplied input for each type of input field is specified via callback subroutine references stored in a hash in the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0818></A>Cryptonite::Mail::Config module:</P><PRE>	LGL_FOLDERNAME =&gt; sub { $_[0] =~ /$_[1]-&gt;{"VFOLDER"}/i

<P class=docText><A name="are invoked"></A>Similar subroutines are invoked whenever an input parameter is validated. The regular expressions for validity are stored separately in Cryptonite::Mail::Config.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of the"></A>Even though most of the validation subroutines are essentially the same, they are all distinct, to enable each one to be tweaked as necessary without affecting the others or sacrificing clarity in this part of the code. The validation regular expressions and error strings are stored in a table as well, to enable localization in the future.</P>

<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0EGLDK>11.8.2. Auditing Crypt::GPG</H4>
<P class=docText><A name="written to"></A>Crypt::GPG had been written to be a working prototype and needed complete auditing to eliminate any potential <A name=idx-CHP-11-0819></A><A name="testing of"></A>security issues before public testing of the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0820></A>system.<A name=idx-CHP-11-0821></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="CPAN since"></A>Crypt::GPG had been freely available on CPAN since 2001, and I'd received much valuable feedback from its users. While many users said that they really liked the module's clean and simple interface, some had trouble getting it to run on certain platforms, where the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0822></A><A name="Expect module"></A>Expect module it used to interact with GnuPG didn't work right. (Expect uses Unix pseudoterminals [ptys] as its IPC mechanism, and that doesn't work on Windows, for example.)</P>
<P class=docText><A name="and syntax"></A>The Expect module's interface and syntax were also somewhat convoluted, which made the code a little difficult to read, as can be seen from this section of the <TT>sign</TT> method:</P>

<P class=docText><A name="also caused"></A>Using the Expect-based module also caused <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Heisenbugs</SPAN><A name="and that"></A>—failures that weren't easily reproducible, and that I discovered were the result of sending input to <SPAN class=docEmphasis>gpg</SPAN><A name=to></A> too fast. The calls to <TT>doze</TT><A name="a few"></A> in the previous code are a workaround for this: they introduce a few milliseconds of delay before sending the next bit of input to <SPAN class=docEmphasis>gpg</SPAN><A name="but failures"></A>. This generally worked, but failures would still occur on heavily loaded systems.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to moving"></A>All these issues pointed to moving away from Expect and using another mechanism to interact with the GnuPG binary. I considered the idea of writing a pure Perl implementation of OpenPGP, but decided against it for basically the same reasons that I had decided to use GnuPG in the first place: <A name=idx-CHP-11-0823></A>Cryptonite is primarily an email client, <A name=idx-CHP-11-0824></A><A name="implementation would"></A>with integrated Open-PGP support. A full OpenPGP implementation would at least double the complexity of the code I would have to maintain.<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('CHP-11-FNOTE-7');">[**]</A></SUP></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name=CHP-11-FNOTE-7>[**]</A></SUP><A name="A pure"></A> A pure-Perl OpenPGP implementation, Crypt::OpenPGP, was written by Ben Trott in 2001–2002, and is available from CPAN. I'm looking forward to using it in future versions of Cryptonite that will support multiple cryptographic backends.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P class=docText>Some operations with <SPAN class=docEmphasis>gpg</SPAN><A name="earlier versions"></A> didn't require any interaction, and earlier versions of the module had used Perl's backtick operator for such cases. Because the backtick operator invokes a shell, it's a <A name=idx-CHP-11-0827></A><A name="the backtick"></A>security risk. With IPC::Run, it was easy to replace the use of the backtick operator with a tiny <A name=idx-CHP-11-0828></A>secure <A name=idx-CHP-11-0829></A><A name="bypassing the"></A>backtick function, thereby bypassing the shell. This made it possible to eliminate all shell invocations in Crypt::GPG.</P><PRE>	sub backtick {

<P class=docText><A name="pointed out"></A>Some users had also pointed out that using temporary files to store plaintext could be <A name=idx-CHP-11-0830></A><A name="overcome without"></A>insecure. This problem could be easily overcome without touching the code, simply by using temporary files on a RAM disk with encrypted swap (such as OpenBSD provides) or an encrypted RAM disk, so plaintext would never be written to disk unencrypted.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Of course"></A>Of course, it would be nice to modify the code to avoid writing plaintext to temporary files at all, but as there already existed a practical workaround, eliminating temporary files went on the to-do list rather than being implemented immediately.</P>
<P class=docText>The new IPC::Run-based Crypt::<A name=idx-CHP-11-0831></A><A name="to CPAN"></A>GPG was uploaded to CPAN at the end of 2005. It now worked on a larger range of operating systems, and was more reliable and secure than its Expect-based predecessor.</P></DIV></DIV>
