<P class=docText><A name="With the"></A>With the <A name=idx-CHP-11-0843></A>Cryptonite mail store, <A name=idx-CHP-11-0844></A><A name="quite snappy"></A>performance had been quite snappy, and most mail store operations had been independent of mailbox size. But with the switch to IMAP, I noticed some major slowdowns with large mailboxes. A little profiling revealed that the performace bottleneck was the pure-Perl <A name=idx-CHP-11-0845></A><A name="implement the"></A>Mail::IMAPClient module, which I'd used to implement the IMAP capability.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="benchmark script"></A>A quick benchmark script (written using the Benchmark module) helped me check whether another CPAN module, <A name=idx-CHP-11-0846></A><A name="the UW"></A>Mail::Cclient, which interfaces to the UW C-Client library, was more efficient than Mail::IMAPClient. The results showed clearly that I'd have to redo the IMAP code using Mail::Cclient:</P><PRE>	                   Rate IMAPClientSearch    CclientSearch
	IMAPClientSearch 39.8/s               --             -73%
	CclientSearch     145/s             264%               --

<P class=docText><A name="before writing"></A>I probably should have thought of benchmarking the different modules before writing the code with Mail::IMAPClient. I'd originally avoided the C-Client library because I wanted to keep the build process as simple as possible, and Mail::IMAPClient's build process is definitely simpler than that of Mail::Cclient.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="from the"></A>Fortunately, the switch from the former to the latter was generally quite straightforward. For some operations, I noticed that IMAPClient could do the job better than C-Client without much of a performance penalty, so Cryptonite::Mail::Service now uses both modules, each to do whatever it's better at.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="is never"></A>A program like Cryptonite is never "finished," of course, but the code is now mature, robust, full of features, and efficient enough to serve its purpose: to provide thousands of concurrent users a <A name=idx-CHP-11-0847></A><A name="helping them"></A>secure, intuitive, and responsive email experience while helping them effectively protect the privacy of their communications.<A name=I_indexterm11_tt250></A><A name=I_indexterm11_tt251></A><A name=I_indexterm11_tt252></A></P></DIV></DIV>
