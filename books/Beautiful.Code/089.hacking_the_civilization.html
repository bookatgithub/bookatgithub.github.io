<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>11.12. Hacking the Civilization</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="This computer"></A>This computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that it includes organic life itself in its operational matrix—the Earth, and the civilizations it hosts—can be reprogrammed in powerful ways by simple pieces of code that hack human culture right back, and rewire the operating system of society itself.<A name=idx-CHP-11-0854></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="the world"></A>Code has changed the world many times. Consider the medical advances made possible by genetic sequencing software, the impact of business software on large enterprises and small businesses alike, the revolutions enabled by industrial automation software and computer modeling, or the multiple revolutions of the Internet: email, the Web, blogs, social networking services, VoIP…. Clearly, much of the history of our times is the story of software innovation.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="can cut"></A>Of course, code, like any technology, can cut both ways, either increasing or decreasing the "returns to violence"<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('CHP-11-FNOTE-11');">[||||]</A></SUP><A name="the efficacy"></A> in society, increasing the efficacy of privacy-violating technology and giving tyrants more effective tools of censorship, on the one hand, or enhancing and promoting individual rights on the other. Code of either sort hacks the very core of human society itself, by altering fundamental social realities such as the tenability of free speech.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name=CHP-11-FNOTE-11>[||||]</A></SUP><A name="refer to"></A> By "returns to violence," I refer to the social and economic incentives for violating individual rights. As the authors of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>The Sovereign Individual</SPAN><A name="factors that"></A> point out, "The key to understanding how societies evolve is to understand factors that determine the costs and rewards of employing violence."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText><A name="a specific"></A>Interestingly, even with a specific technology such as public key cryptography, the implementation chosen can significantly alter cultural realities. For example, a PKI-based implementation reimposes authoritarian properties such as centralized hierarchies and identification requirements on a technology whose entire value arguably lies in its lack of those properties. Despite this, PKI approaches deliver weaker key authentication than does a web-of-trust implementation (which also doesn't dilute other important features of public-key cryptography, such as distributed deployment).</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the weavers"></A>I think that as the weavers of code, it is to a large extent the ethical responsibility of programmers to seek not only that our code be beautiful in its design and implementation, but also that it be beautiful in its results, in a larger social context. This is why I find freedom code so beautiful. It puts computing technology to the most sublime use: protecting human rights and human life.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="treaties can"></A>Laws and international human rights treaties can go only so far in protecting individual rights. History has shown that these are far too easy to bypass or ignore. On the other hand, the mathematics of cryptosystems can, when implemented carefully, provide practically impenetrable shields for individual rights and open expression, and can finally set people across the world free to communicate and trade in privacy and liberty.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Actualizing this"></A>Actualizing this global, mathematically protected open society is largely up to us, the gods of the machine.<A name=I_indexterm11_tt253></A></P></DIV></DIV>
