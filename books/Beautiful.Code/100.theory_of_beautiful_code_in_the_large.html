<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>13.5. Theory of Beautiful Code in the Large</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="The Gene"></A>The Gene Sorter is one of the more beautiful programs at the design and code level that I've worked on. Most of the major parts of the system, including the cart, the directory of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.ra</SPAN><A name="to the"></A> riles, and the interface to the genomics database, are on their second or third iterations and incorporate lessons we learned from previous programs. The structure of the program's objects nicely parallels the major components of the user interface and the relational databases. The algorithms used are simple but effective, and make good trade-offs between speed, memory usage, and code complexity. The program has had very few bugs compared to most programs its size. Other people are able to come up to speed on the code base and contribute to it relatively quickly.<A name=idx-CHP-13-1069></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="human activity"></A>Programming is a human activity, and perhaps the resource that <A name=idx-CHP-13-1070></A><A name="most when"></A>limits us most when programming is our <A name=idx-CHP-13-1071></A><A name="typically keep"></A>human memory. We can typically keep a half-dozen things in our short-term memory. Any more than that requires us to involve our long-term memory as well. Our long-term memory system actually has an amazingly large capacity, but we enter things into it relatively slowly, and we can't retrieve things from it randomly, only by association.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="a few"></A>While the structure of a program of no more than a few hundred lines can be dictated by algorithmic and machine considerations, the structure of larger programs must be dictated by human considerations, at least if we expect humans to work productively to maintain and extend them in the long term.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="you need"></A>Ideally, everything that you need to understand a piece of code should fit on a single screen. If not, the reader of the code will be forced at best to hop around from screen to screen in hopes of understanding the code. If the code is complex, the reader is likely to have forgotten what is defined on each screen by the time he gets back to the initial screen, and will actually have to <SPAN class=docEmphasis>memorize</SPAN><A name="code before"></A> large amounts of the code before he can understand any part of it. Needless to say, this will slow down programmers, and many of them will find it frustrating as well.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=idx-CHP-13-1072></A><A name=making></A>Well-chosen names are very important to making <A name=idx-CHP-13-1073></A><A name="code locally"></A>code locally <A name=idx-CHP-13-1074></A><A name="a few"></A>understandable. It's OK to have a few local variables (no more than can fit in short-term memory) with one- and two-letter names. All other names should be words, short phrases, or commonly used (and short) abbreviations. In most cases, the reader should be able to tell the purpose of a variable or <A name=idx-CHP-13-1075></A><A name="its name"></A>function just from its name.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="our fancy"></A>These days, with our fancy integrated development environments, the reader can, at the click of a mouse, go from where a symbol is used to where it is defined. However, we want to write our code so that the user needs to go to the symbol definition only when she is curious about the details. We shouldn't force her to follow a couple of hyperlinks to understand each line.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="too long"></A>Names can be too long as well as too short, though most programmers, influenced by the mathematical descriptions of algorithms and such evils as Hungarian notation, err on the short side. It may take some time to come up with a good name, but it is time well spent.</P>
<P class=docText>For a local variable, a <A name=idx-CHP-13-1076></A>well-chosen name may be sufficient documentation. Thus, <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('the_filter_method_for_association_type_columns_that_handle_w');">Example 13-3</A> shows a reasonably nicely done function from the <A name=idx-CHP-13-1077></A><A name="is also"></A>Gene Sorter. It filters associations according to criteria that can contain wildcards. (There is also a simpler, faster method that handles only exact matches.) The code fits on one screen, which is always a virtue in a function, though not always possible.</P><A name=the_filter_method_for_association_type_columns_that_handle_w></A>

<P class=docText><A name="prototype is"></A>The function prototype is followed by a one-sentence comment that summarizes what the function does. The <A name=idx-CHP-13-1078></A><A name="is broken"></A>code within the function is broken into "paragraphs," each starting with a comment summarizing what the block does in English.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="at several"></A>Programmers can read this function at several different levels of details. For some, the name itself tells them all they need. Others will want to read the opening comment as well. Still others will read all the comments, ignoring the code. Those interested in the full details will read every line.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Because human"></A>Because human memory is so strongly associative, once a reader has read the function at one level of detail, reading it at a higher level will <A name=idx-CHP-13-1079></A><A name="to recall"></A>generally be enough to recall the more detailed levels. This happens in part because the higher levels form a framework for organizing your memory of the function even as you are reading the lower levels.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the programming"></A>In general, the larger the programming entity, the more <A name=idx-CHP-13-1080></A><A name="A variable"></A>documentation it deserves. A variable needs at least a word, a function at least a sentence, and larger entities such as modules or objects perhaps a paragraph. It's very helpful if a program as a whole can have a few pages of <A name=idx-CHP-13-1081></A>documentation providing an overview.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="too much"></A>It's possible to have too much documentation as well as too little. Documentation is of no use if people don't read it, and people tend to avoid reading long text, especially if it is repetitious.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="people are"></A>Humans tend to remember the important things best, though a few people are blessed (or cursed) with a good memory for trivia. The words used in a programming name are important, but whether the style is <TT><I>varName, VarName, varname, var_name, VARNAME, vrblnam</I></TT>, or <TT><I>Variable_Name</I></TT><A name="so important"></A> is not so important. What is important is that a <A name=idx-CHP-13-1082></A><A name="and followed"></A>single convention be adopted and followed consistently, so that the programmer need not waste time and memory remembering which style is used in any particular case.</P>
<P class=docText>Other keys to keeping code <A name=idx-CHP-13-1083></A>understandable are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Use a <A name=idx-CHP-13-1084></A><A name="use a"></A>scope as local as possible. Never use a global variable when an object variable will do, and never use an object variable when a local variable will do.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name=Minimize></A>Minimize <A name=idx-CHP-13-1085></A>side effects. In particular, avoid <SPAN class=docEmphasis>altering</SPAN><A name="the return"></A> any variables except the return value in a function. A function that obeys this rule is called "<A name=idx-CHP-13-1086></A><A name="thing of"></A>reentrant," and is a thing of beauty. Not only is it easy to understand, it is automatically thread-safe and capable of being used recursively. Beyond readability, code with few side effects is easier to reuse in different contexts.</P></LI></UL>
<P class=docText><A name="programmers are"></A>These days, many programmers are well aware of the negative impact of global variables on code reuse. Another thing that can discourage code reuse is dependence on data structures. The object-oriented programming style sometimes can end up backfiring in this regard. If useful code is embedded in an object method, one must construct an object to use the code. For some objects, this task can be pretty complex.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="is not"></A>A function that is not embedded in an object, and which takes as parameters standard data types, is a lot more likely to be used in many different contexts than a method deeply embedded in a complex object hierarchy. For instance, the previously mentioned <TT>weedUnlessInHash</TT><A name="Gene Sorter"></A> function, although written for use by the column object in the Gene Sorter, was designed not to depend on being in a column. So, this useful little function may see application in other contexts now as well.</P></DIV></DIV>
