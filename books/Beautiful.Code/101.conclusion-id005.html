<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>13.6. Conclusion</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="This chapter"></A>This chapter has been about one of the prettier pieces of code I've written. The program serves a useful purpose for biomedical researchers. The cart system makes it relatively easy to construct an interactive program over the Web, even though it uses a CGI interface. Both the user's model and the programmer's model of the program revolve around the idea of a big table with one row per gene and a variable number of columns that can represent many different types of data.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Sorter is"></A>Although the Gene Sorter is written in C, the column code is done in a straightforward, polymorphic, object-oriented design. Additional columns can be added by editing simple text files with no additional programming required, and these same files help make it easy for a single version of the program to work on different genomic databases associated with a variety of organisms.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="disk seeks"></A>The design minimizes disk seeks, which continue to be a bottleneck, lagging CPU and memory speeds by a large margin. The code is written to be readable and reusable. I hope you will find some of the principles it is built on useful in your own programs.<A name=I_indexterm13_tt306></A><A name=I_indexterm13_tt307></A></P></DIV></DIV>
