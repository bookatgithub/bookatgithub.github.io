<P class=docText><A name="At the"></A>At the basis of solutions to <A name=idx-CHP-14-1131></A><A name="lies a"></A>dense linear systems lies a decompositional approach. The general idea is the following: given a problem involving a matrix <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN><A name=decomposes></A>, one factors or decomposes <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN><A name="product of"></A> into a product of simpler matrices from which the problem can easily be solved. This divides the computational problem into two parts: first determine an appropriate decomposition, and then use it in solving the problem at hand.<A name=idx-CHP-14-1132></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="of solving"></A>Consider the problem of solving the linear system:</P><PRE>	<TT><I>Ax = b</I></TT>
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>where <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN> is a nonsingular matrix of order <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN><A name="possible to"></A>. The decompositional approach begins with the observation that it is possible to factor <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN> in the form:</P><PRE>	<TT><I>A = LU</I></TT>
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>where <SPAN class=docEmphasis>L</SPAN><A name="lower triangular"></A> is a lower triangular matrix (a matrix that has only zeros above the diagonal) with ones on the diagonal, and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>U</SPAN><A name="zeros below"></A> is upper triangular (with only zeros below the diagonal). During the decomposition process, diagonal elements of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN> (called <A name=idx-CHP-14-1133></A><A name="elements below"></A>pivots) are used to divide the elements below the diagonal. If matrix <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN><A name="has a"></A> has a zero pivot, the process will break with division-by-zero error. Also, small values of the pivots excessively amplify the numerical errors of the process. So for numerical stability, the method needs to interchange rows of the matrix or make sure pivots are as large (in absolute value) as possible. This observation leads to a row permutation matrix <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN><A name="factored form"></A> and modifies the factored form to:</P><PRE>	<TT><I>P</I></TT><SUP>T</SUP> <TT><I>A = LU</I></TT>
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="then be"></A>The solution can then be written in the form:</P><PRE>	<TT><I>x = A</I></TT><SUP>-1</SUP><TT><I>Pb</I></TT>
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="suggests the"></A>which then suggests the following algorithm for solving the system of equations:</P>

<P class=docText>This approach to <A name=idx-CHP-14-1134></A><A name="decomposition has"></A>matrix computations through decomposition has proven very useful for several reasons. First, the approach separates the computation into two stages: the computation of a decomposition, followed by the use of the decomposition to solve the problem at hand. This can be important, for example, if different right hand sides are present and need to be solved at different points in the process. The matrix needs to be factored only once and reused for the different righthand sides. This is particularly important because the factorization of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN>, step 1, requires <SPAN class=docEmphasis>O(n<SUP>3</SUP>)</SPAN> operations, whereas the solutions, steps 2 and 3, require only <SPAN class=docEmphasis>O(n<SUP>2</SUP>)</SPAN> operations. Another aspect of the algorithm's strength is in storage: the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>L</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>U</SPAN><A name="space occupied"></A> factors do not require extra storage, but can take over the space occupied initially by <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN>.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="discussion of"></A>For the discussion of coding this algorithm, we present only the computationally intensive part of the process, which is step 1, the factorization of the matrix.</P></DIV></DIV>
