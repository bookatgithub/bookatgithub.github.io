<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>14.9. A Word About the Error Analysis and Operation Count</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="The key"></A>The key aspect of all of the implementations presented in this chapter is their numerical properties.<A name=idx-CHP-14-1244></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="to forgo"></A>It is acceptable to forgo elegance in order to gain performance. But numerical stability is of vital importance and cannot be sacrificed because it is an inherent part of the algorithm's correctness. While these are serious considerations, there is some consolation to follow. It may be surprising to some readers that all of the algorithms presented are the same, even though it's virtually impossible to make each excerpt of code produce exactly the same output for exactly the same inputs.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to repeatability"></A>When it comes to repeatability of results, the vagaries of floating-point representation may be captured in a rigorous way by <SPAN class=docEmphasis>error bounds</SPAN><A name="of expressing"></A>. One way of expressing the numerical robustness of the previous algorithms is with the following formula:<A name=idx-CHP-14-1245></A></P><PRE>	||r||/||A|| <IMG alt="less-than or equal to" src="images/U2264.GIF"> ||e|| <IMG alt="less-than or equal to" src="images/U2264.GIF"> ||A<SUP>-1</SUP>|| ||r||
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>where error <SPAN class=docEmphasis>e = x – y</SPAN><A name="between the"></A> is the difference between the computed solution <TT>y</TT> and the correct solution <TT>x</TT>, and <TT>r</TT>= <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Ay – b</SPAN><A name="of the"></A> is a so-called "residual." The previous formula basically says that the size of the error (the parallel bars surrounding a value indicate a norm—a measure of absolute size) is as small as warranted by the quality of the matrix <SPAN class=docEmphasis>A</SPAN><A name="matrix is"></A>. Therefore, if the matrix is close to being singular in numerical sense (some entries are so small that they might as well be considered to be zero), the algorithms will not give an accurate answer. But, otherwise, a relatively good quality of result can be expected.<A name=I_indexterm14_tt329></A><A name=I_indexterm14_tt330></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="common to"></A>Another feature that is common to all the versions presented is the <A name=idx-CHP-14-1246></A>operation count: they all perform 2/3n<SUP>3</SUP><A name="operations is"></A> floating-point multiplications and/or additions. The order of these operations is what differentiates them. There are algorithms that increase the amount of floating-point work to save on memory traffic or network transfers (especially for distribute-memory parallel algorithms). But because the algorithms shown in this chapter have the same operation count, it is valid to compare them for performance. The computational rate (number of floating-point operations per second) may be used instead of the time taken to solve the problem, provided that the matrix size is the same. But comparing computational rates is sometimes better because it allows a comparison of algorithms when the matrix sizes differ. For example, a sequential algorithm on a single processor can be directly compared with a parallel one working on a large cluster on a much bigger matrix.</P></DIV></DIV>
