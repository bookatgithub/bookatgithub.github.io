<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>14.10. Future Directions for Research</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="In this"></A>In this chapter, we have looked at the evolution of the design of a simple but important algorithm in computational science. The changes over the past 30 years have been necessary to follow the lead of the advances in computer architectures. In some cases, these changes have been simple, such as interchanging loops. In other cases, they have been as complex as the introduction of recursion and look-ahead computations. In each case, however, the <A name=idx-CHP-14-1247></A><A name="utilize the"></A>code's ability to efficiently utilize the memory hierarchy is the key to high performance on a single processor as well as on shared and distributed memory systems.<A name=idx-CHP-14-1248></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="the problem"></A>The essence of the problem is the dramatic increase in complexity that software developers have had to confront, and still do. Dual-core machines are already common, and the number of cores is expected to roughly double with each processor generation. But contrary to the assumptions of the old model, programmers will not be able to consider these cores independently (i.e., multi-core is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>not</SPAN><A name="they share"></A> "the new SMP") because they share on-chip resources in ways that separate processors do not. This situation is made even more complicated by the other nonstandard components that future architectures are expected to deploy, including the mixing of different types of cores, <A name=idx-CHP-14-1249></A>hardware accelerators, and memory systems.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="widely divergent"></A>Finally, the proliferation of widely divergent design ideas shows that the question of how to best combine all these new resources and components is largely unsettled. When combined, these changes produce a picture of a future in which programmers will have to overcome software design problems vastly more complex and challenging than those in the past in order to take advantage of the much higher degrees of concurrency and greater computing power that new architectures will offer.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="will work"></A>So, the bad news is that none of the presented code will work efficiently someday. The good news is that we have learned various ways to mold the original simple rendition of the algorithm to meet the ever-increasing challenges of hardware designs.</P></DIV></DIV>
