<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphSmaller><A name="seemingly straightforward"></A>Some algorithms for seemingly straightforward and simple</SPAN> <A name=idx-CHP-15-1251></A><A name="actually extremely"></A>mathematical equations are actually extremely difficult to implement. For instance, rounding problems can compromise accuracy, some mathematical equations can cause values to exceed the range of a floating-point value on the system, and some algorithms (notably the classic Fourier Transform) take much too long if done in a brute-force fashion. Furthermore, different sets of data work better with different algorithms. Consequently, beautiful <A name=idx-CHP-15-1252></A><A name="beautiful mathematics"></A>code and beautiful mathematics are not necessarily one and the same.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="wrote the"></A>The programmers who wrote the code for the CERN mathematical library recognized the difference between mathematical equations and <A name=idx-CHP-15-1253></A><A name="explore the"></A>computed solutions: the difference between theory and practice. In this chapter, I will explore the beauty in a few of the programming strategies that they used to bridge that gap.</P><A name=my_idea_of_beautiful_code></A>
<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>15.1. My Idea of Beautiful Code</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="of beautiful"></A>My idea of beautiful code stems from my belief that the ultimate purpose of code is to work. In other words, code should accurately and efficiently perform the task that it was designed to complete, in such a way that there are no ambiguities as to how it will behave.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="code that"></A>I find beauty in code that I can trust—code that I am confident will produce results that are correct and applicable to my problem. What I am defining here as my first criterion of beautiful code is code that I can use and reuse without any shred of doubt in the code's ability to deliver results. In other words, my primary concern is not what the code looks like, but what I can do with it.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="beauty in"></A>It's not that I don't appreciate the beauty in code's implementation details; I do indeed, and I will discuss criteria and examples of code's inner beauty later in this chapter. My point here is that when code satisfies my somewhat nontraditional notion of beauty in utility, it's rarely necessary to look at its implementation details. Such code promotes what I believe to be one of the most important missions in the industry: the ability to share code with others, without requiring them to analyze the code and figure out exactly how it works. Beautiful code is like a beautiful car. You rarely need to open it up to look at its mechanics. Rather, you enjoy it from the outside and trust that it will drive you where you want to go.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="For code"></A>For code to be enjoyed in this way, it must be designed so that it's clear how it should be used, easy to understand how you can apply it to solve your own problems, and easy to verify if you are using it correctly.</P></DIV></DIV>
