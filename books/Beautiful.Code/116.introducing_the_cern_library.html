<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>15.2. Introducing the CERN Library</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="I believe"></A>I believe that the mathematical library developed by CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) is a prime example of beautiful code. The code in this library performs algebraic operations, integrates functions, solves differential equations, and solves a lot of physics problems. It was written over 30 years ago and has been widely used over the years. The linear algebra part of the CERN Library evolved into the LAPACK library, which is the code that I will discuss here. The LAPACK library is currently developed by multiple universities and organizations.<A name=idx-CHP-15-1254></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="this code"></A>I have used this code since I was young, and I am still fascinated by it. The beauty of this code is that it contains many complicated mathematical algorithms that are very well tested and difficult to reproduce. You can reuse it and rely on it without having to worry about whether it works.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="and reliability"></A>The library's high accuracy and reliability are why—even after all these years—it remains the mathematical library of choice for anyone who needs to accurately and reliably solve equations. There are other mathematical libraries available, but they can't compete with the CERN library's proven reliability and accuracy.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="part of"></A>The first part of this chapter discusses this code's outer beauty: the things that make it so accurate and reliable that developers want to reuse it and the elements that make this reuse as simple as possible. The second part explores the inner beauty of its implementation details.</P></DIV></DIV>
