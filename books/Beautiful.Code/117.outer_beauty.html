<P class=docText><A name="If you"></A>If you've ever tried to solve a system of linear equations or perform an equally complicated mathematical operation, you know that many times the code you write to achieve this does not deliver the correct results. One of the greatest problems with mathematical libraries is that rounding errors and floating-point operations lead to solution instabilities and incorrect results.<A name=idx-CHP-15-1255></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="a mathematical"></A>If you design a mathematical library, you need to carefully define the range in which each algorithm will work. You need to write each algorithm in such a way that it will adhere to these conditions, and you also need to write it in such a way that the rounding errors will cancel out. This can be very complicated.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the algorithms"></A>In the CERN library, the algorithms are specified in a very precise way. Basically, if you look at any routine, you will notice that it has a description of what it is going to do. It really doesn't matter in which language the routine is written. In fact, these routines were written in Fortran but have interfaces that allow them to be called from almost any other place. That's also a beautiful thing. In some sense, the routine is a black box: you don't care what goes on inside, only that it delivers the appropriate results for your inputs. It carefully defines what every routine is doing, under which conditions it is working, what input data it accepts, and what constraints must be put on the input data in order to get the correct answer.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="at the"></A>For example, let's look at the LAPACK library's <A name=idx-CHP-15-1256></A><A name="a system"></A>SGBSV routine, which solves a system of linear equations for a banded matrix. If you try to solve a system of linear equations numerically, you use different algorithms. Different algorithms operate better in different domains, and you need to know the structure of the matrix to choose the best one. For instance, you would want to use one algorithm to solve the problem if you had a banded matrix (a matrix where most of the elements are around the diagonal), and a different one if you had a sparse matrix (a matrix that has a lot of zeros and few numbers).</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to use"></A>Because different routines are optimized for different situations, the best routine to use really depends on the matrix structure that you have. However, in order to understand the range of this, you need to understand how to input data to these routines. Sometimes you input data in the form of a matrix. Sometimes—for instance, with a banded matrix— you send it like a very narrow array. Each of these routines and their requirements are described very clearly in the library:</P>

	*
	* Purpose
	* =======
	*
	* <A name=idx-CHP-15-1257></A>SGBSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
	* A * X = B, where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals
	* and KU superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
	*
	* The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is

	* and unit lower triangular matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is
	* upper triangular with KL+KU superdiagonals. The factored form of A
	* is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
	*
	* Arguments

	*
	* N        (input) INTEGER
	*          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
	*          matrix A. N &gt;= 0.
	*
	* KL       (input) INTEGER
	*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A. KL &gt;= 0.
	*
	* KU       (input) INTEGER

	*          On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
	*          2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
	*          The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
	*          array AB as follows:
	*          AB(KL+KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)&lt;=i&lt;=min(N,j+KL)
	*          On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
	*          upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
	*          rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
	*          factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
	*          See below for further details.
	*

	*          The leading dimension of the array AB. LDAB &gt;= 2*KL+KU+1.
	*

	*          The pivot indices that define the permutation matrix P;
	*          row i of the matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
	*
	* B        (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
	*          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
	*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
	*
	* LDB      (input) INTEGER
	*          The leading dimension of the array B. LDB &gt;= max(1,N).
	*
	* INFO     (output) INTEGER
	*          = 0: successful exit
	*          &lt; 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
	*          &gt; 0: if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
	*               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
	*               singular, and the solution has not been computed.
	*
	* Further Details
	* ===============
	*
	* The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
	* M = N = 6, KL = 2, KU = 1:

<P class=docText><A name="the first"></A>One of the first things to notice in the code for the <A name=idx-CHP-15-1260></A><A name="it starts"></A>SGBSV routine is that it starts with a long comment that describes the routine's purpose and use. In fact, the comment is exactly the same as the manual page for that routine. Having the <A name=idx-CHP-15-1261></A><A name="in the"></A>full documentation of the routine's usage in the code is important because it connects the routine's internal structure with its usage. In many other cases, I have found that the manual description and code documentation have nothing in common. I think this practice of marrying the two is one thing that makes code beautiful.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Following the"></A>Following the initial comments, the algorithm that the routine uses is <A name=idx-CHP-15-1262></A><A name="This helps"></A>detailed in the routine's description. This helps anyone using the code to understand what the code will do and how it should react. Next comes a detailed description of the arguments, with their ranges explicitly specified.</P>
<P class=docText>The <TT>AB</TT><A name="interesting one"></A> argument is an interesting one to consider. This argument contains the elements of the matrix <TT>A</TT><A name="matrix is"></A>. Because the matrix is banded, it contains a lot of zero values, which are not clustered close to the diagonal. In <A name=idx-CHP-15-1263></A><A name="the routine"></A>principle, the input to the routine could be presented as a two-dimensional array of the dimensions of the matrix. However, this would be a waste of memory space. Instead, the <TT>AB</TT><A name="its diagonal"></A> argument contains only nonzero elements of the matrix next to its diagonal.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of the"></A>The format of the <TT>AB</TT><A name="memory space"></A> argument not only conserves memory space, but also has another purpose. In this routine, the algorithm is using the properties of the system of equations to solve the problem in a more efficient way. This means that the algorithm relies on the user to provide the correct matrix type as an input. If the <TT>AB</TT><A name="of the"></A> argument contains all the elements of the matrix, one or more of the elements outside the band could accidentally be set to nonzero. This could lead to errors in the solution. The format chosen for <TT>AB</TT><A name="makes it"></A> makes it impossible to make this mistake. This was done on purpose, and it contributes to the code's <A name=idx-CHP-15-1264></A>beauty.</P>
<P class=docText>The <TT>AB</TT><A name="another role"></A> argument also plays another role: it serves as an output argument as well as an input argument. In this context, the design solves a different problem. By having the routine reuse the space that the original program allocated, the developers <A name=idx-CHP-15-1265></A><A name="ensured that"></A>of this code ensured that the routine would work as long as the original program had sufficient memory. If it had been written so that the routine needed additional memory allocation, then it might not run if the system was unable to allocate more memory. This can be especially problematic when there is a really large system of equations, and the routine needs a significant amount of memory space in which it can operate. The sample code is immune to such problems because it was written so that the routine can return the solution as long as the original program has sufficient memory space to store the problem. This is very beautiful.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="move on"></A>Before I move on to the other arguments, I want to discuss this issue further. I have seen a lot of code written in my lifetime. Very often, developers write code and unconsciously place intrinsic <A name=idx-CHP-15-1266></A><A name="they restrict"></A>restrictions on it. Most commonly, they restrict the size of the problem that can be solved. This occurs as a result of the following thought process:</P>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<OL class=docList type=1>
<LI>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
<P class=docList>I have something to write.</P></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
<P class=docList>I'll write it fast so I can see if it works.</P></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
<P class=docList>Once it works, I will generalize it for the real problem.</P></DIV></LI></OL></DIV>
<P class=docText><A name="often leads"></A>This process prompts developers to build restrictions into code, which very often leads to difficult-to-find errors that may take years to clean. During this process, developers commonly place explicit or implicit restrictions on the size of the problem they may solve. For example, an explicit restriction may be the definition of a large data space, which should be large enough for all the problems. This is bad and relatively easy to spot. An implicit restriction may be improper usage of dynamic memory—for instance, writing code so that once the problem is presented to the code, the program dynamically allocates the space and solves the problem. For large problems, this can create out-of-memory errors and significantly impact performance. The performance penalty stems from the program's reliance on the operating system's paging utility. If the algorithm is computationally intensive and needs data from many different chunks of memory, the program will fall into constant paging and execute very slowly.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of this"></A>Another example of this type of problem manifests itself in programs that use database systems. If such a program is written in the manner I just described, it could start constantly accessing the database when it is operating on the data. The programmer might think that the program's operations are trivial and fast, but they are actually very inefficient because they contain calls to the database.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="lesson here"></A>So what is the lesson here? When writing beautiful code, one needs to think about its <A name=idx-CHP-15-1267></A><A name="not come"></A>scalability. Contrary to popular belief, scalability does not come from code optimization; rather, it comes from using the right algorithm. Code profiling can provide hints about symptoms of <A name=idx-CHP-15-1268></A><A name="poor performance"></A>poor performance, but the root cause of performance issues can generally be traced back to design issues. The <A name=idx-CHP-15-1269></A><A name="designed so"></A>SGBSV routine is designed so that it does not have this performance problem, and that is another thing that makes it beautiful.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the other"></A>Looking now at the other input arguments, it becomes clear that the same <A name=idx-CHP-15-1270></A><A name="applied to"></A>principle that applied to the <TT>AB</TT><A name="to the"></A> array also applies to the others.</P>
<P class=docText>The final argument, <TT>INFO</TT>, is the error <A name=idx-CHP-15-1271></A><A name="presented to"></A>communication mechanism. It is interesting to see how the diagnostics are presented to the <A name=idx-CHP-15-1272></A><A name="possible that"></A>user. It is possible that the system <A name=idx-CHP-15-1273></A><A name="have a"></A>of equations does not have a solution, and this case is also reported here. Notice that the <TT>INFO</TT><A name="as success"></A> argument reports failure as well as success, and that it provides diagnostics to help you identify the problem.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="This is"></A>This is something often lacking in code written today. Nowadays, code is commonly written to handle positive use cases: it is written to perform the actions detailed in the specification. With the sample code, this means that the code will work fine if the solution for the system of equations exists. However, reality is messy. In real life, code can break, and code dumps core or throw exceptions when it is presented with a system of equations that lacks a solution. This is a common case of failure to specify requirements about unexpected usages.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="are programmed"></A>Many systems today are programmed to do as little as possible; then—once they are in use—they are "fixed" to do the things nobody initially anticipated they would need to do. A similar problem is the failure to specify requirements about how to gracefully handle errors and other unexpected situations. Such a response to exceptional circumstances is critical to application reliability and should be treated as a fundamental functionality requirement.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to a"></A>When writing code to a specification, developers need to recognize that <A name=idx-CHP-15-1274></A><A name="usually incomplete"></A>specifications are usually incomplete. The developer must have a deep understanding of the problem at hand so that she can extend the specification with the additional use cases and unexpected usages that need to be implemented in order for the code to perform in an intelligent way. Our sample <A name=idx-CHP-15-1275></A><A name="example of"></A>routine is one example of what happens when such careful consideration is applied. This routine will either do the job, or it will tell you that it cannot do it—it won't crash on you. This is beautiful.</P>
<P class=docText>Next, let's look at the routine's <TT>Further Details</TT><A name="it obvious"></A> section. This section describes how the memory is used and makes it obvious that the space is used as the scratch space during internal operations. This is a good example of beautifully implemented code, so I'll be discussing this in the next section, "Inner Beauty."</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of the"></A>Another example of the code's <A name=idx-CHP-15-1276></A><A name="many routines"></A>outer beauty is that many routines in the CERN library provide simple <A name=idx-CHP-15-1277></A>test and <A name=idx-CHP-15-1278></A><A name="for beautiful"></A>example programs. This is very important for beautiful code. You should be able to tell whether the code is doing what it's supposed to be doing in your application. The developers of this library have written test programs that show you how the library is being called for specific data. You can use these test programs to verify whether you are going to get the correct results for your data, thus building your confidence in the library.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="The beautiful"></A>The beautiful design here is that the tests not only tell you under which conditions you can use the routines, but also give you a validation example that allows you to build confidence and know what's going on—without really looking into the code.<A name=I_indexterm15_tt333></A><A name=I_indexterm15_tt334></A></P></DIV></DIV>
