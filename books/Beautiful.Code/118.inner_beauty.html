<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>15.4. Inner Beauty</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="start looking"></A>Now, let's start looking at the code's <A name=idx-CHP-15-1279></A>implementation details.<A name=idx-CHP-15-1280></A></P><A name=beauty_in_brevity_and_simplicity></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0ERPDK>15.4.1. Beauty in Brevity and Simplicity</H4>
<P class=docText><A name="beautiful code"></A>I believe that beautiful code is short code, and I find that lengthy, complicated code is generally quite ugly. The SGBSV routine is a prime example of the beauty of short code. It begins with a quick verification of the consistency of the input arguments, then continues with two calls that logically follow the mathematical algorithm.<A name=idx-CHP-15-1281></A><A name=idx-CHP-15-1282></A><A name=idx-CHP-15-1283></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="it is"></A>From the first glance, it is obvious what this code is doing: it begins <A name=idx-CHP-15-1284></A><A name="LU factorization"></A>by performing LU factorization with the SGBTRF routine, then solves the system with the SGBTRS routine. This code is very easy to read. There's no need to pore over hundreds of lines of code to understand what the code does. The main task is split into two subtasks, and the subtasks are pushed into a <A name=idx-CHP-15-1285></A>subsystem.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="subsystem adheres"></A>Note that the subsystem adheres to the same design assumptions regarding memory usage as the main system. This is a very important and beautiful aspect of the design.</P>
<P class=docText>The routines from the subsystem are reused in different "<A name=idx-CHP-15-1286></A><A name="hierarchical system"></A>driver" routines (the SGBSV routine is called a driver routine). This creates a hierarchical system that encourages code reuse. This is beautiful, too. Code reuse significantly reduces the effort required for code development, testing, and maintenance. In fact, it is one of the best ways to increase developers' productivity and reduce their stress. The problem is that reuse is typically difficult. Very often, code is so complicated and difficult to read that developers find it easier to rewrite code from scratch than to reuse somebody else's code. Good design and clear, concise code are vital to promoting code reuse.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the code"></A>Unfortunately, much of the code written today falls short in this respect. Nowadays, most of the code written has an <A name=idx-CHP-15-1287></A><A name="in the"></A>inheritance structure, which is encouraged in the hope that it will bring clarity to the code. However, I must admit that I've spent hours on end staring at a few lines of such code…and still could not <A name=idx-CHP-15-1288></A><A name="to do"></A>decipher what it was supposed to do. This is not beautiful code; it is bad code with a convoluted design. If you cannot tell what the code does by glancing at the naming conventions and several code lines, then the code is too complicated.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Beautiful code"></A>Beautiful code should be easy to understand. I hate reading code that was written to show off the developer's knowledge of the language, and I shouldn't need to go through 25 files before I can really understand what a piece of it is really doing. The code does not necessarily need to be commented, but its purpose should be explicit, and there should be no ambiguity in each operation. The problem with the new code being written today—especially in the C++ language—is that developers use so much inheritance and <A name=idx-CHP-15-1289></A><A name="impossible to"></A>overloading that it's almost impossible to tell what the code is really doing, why it's doing it, and whether it's correct. To figure this out, you need to understand all of the hierarchy of <A name=idx-CHP-15-1290></A><A name="the operation"></A>inheritance and overloading. If the operation is some kind of complicated overloaded operation, this code is not beautiful to me.</P><A name=beauty_in_frugality></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0EFSDK>15.4.2. Beauty in Frugality</H4>
<P class=docText><A name="criterion for"></A>My next criterion for beautiful code is that you can tell that a lot of thought went into how the code will be running on the computer. What I'm trying to say is that beautiful code never forgets that it will be running on a computer, and that a computer has limitations. As I said earlier in this chapter, computers have limited speed, sometimes operate better on floating-point numbers or integer numbers, and have finite amounts of memory. Beautiful code must consider these limitations of reality. Quite often, people writing code assume that memory is infinite, computer speed is infinite, and so on. This is not beautiful code; it's arrogant code. Beautiful code is frugal about things like memory use and reuses memory whenever possible.<A name=idx-CHP-15-1291></A><A name=idx-CHP-15-1292></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="the LU"></A>For example, let's look at the LU decomposition subroutine <A name=idx-CHP-15-1293></A><A name="removed the"></A>SGBTRF, which is in the second level of subroutines. To save space, I removed the initial comments in the header and other excepts that I do not directly discuss (you can view the complete subroutine at <A name=idx-CHP-15-1294></A><A class=docLink href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/sgbtrf.f.html" target=_blank>http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/sgbtrf.f.html</A>):</P>

<P class=docText><A name="starts with"></A>Again, the subroutine starts with argument verification and then proceeds to the problem solution. This is followed by an optimization <A name=idx-CHP-15-1299></A><A name="problem size"></A>check, which looks at the problem size to determine whether it can be solved in the "cache" arrays <TT>WORK13</TT> and <TT>WORK31</TT><A name="be sent"></A>, or whether it needs to be sent to a lower level for more complicated operations. This is an excellent example of code that is built realistically, for a computer with inherent limitations. The work array can be adjusted for the standard memory of the computer that is solving the problem; in problems with a small enough size, this can prevent performance penalties from possible paging. Problems above that size are so large that that the performance penalty cannot be avoided.</P><A name=beauty_in_flow></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0EAVDK>15.4.3. Beauty in Flow</H4>
<P class=docText><A name="The previous"></A>The previous problem solution provides a step-by-step representation of the algorithm. Reading this code is almost like reading a book, since it is so easy to follow. The parts of the problem that are common to other algorithms are reused, and the parts that would complicate the code are passed to <A name=idx-CHP-15-1300></A><A name="a very"></A>subroutines. The result is a very clear, understandable flow.<A name=idx-CHP-15-1301></A><A name=idx-CHP-15-1302></A><A name=idx-CHP-15-1303></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="the flow"></A>Each step in the flow corresponds to the mathematical expression. At each step, the code describes what a lower system is expected to do and calls that lower system. The main routine, which is a driver routine, branches into lower routines, each of which branches into more lower routines, and so on. This flow is represented in <A name=idx-CHP-15-1304></A><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('logical_subdivision_of_tasks_into_subroutines');">Figure 15-1</A>.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="an excellent"></A>This is an excellent example of how to apply the "divide and conquer" <A name=idx-CHP-15-1305></A><A name="Every time"></A>principle to code design. Every time you move to a lower step, there is a smaller problem to conquer, and you can focus on well-defined circumstances that make the code smaller and better focused. If the problem fits in the computer's memory, the algorithm will solve it directly, as I discussed previously. If not, it goes to the next level of subroutines, and so on.<A name=I_indexterm15_tt336></A><A name=I_indexterm15_tt337></A><A name=I_indexterm15_tt338></A></P><A name=logical_subdivision_of_tasks_into_subroutines></A>

<P class=docText><A name="and then"></A>As a result, very computation-intensive routines can be written in assembly language and then optimized for the architecture. Another benefit of this design is that many people can work on the code simultaneously because each subroutine is independent and so well defined.</P></DIV></DIV>
