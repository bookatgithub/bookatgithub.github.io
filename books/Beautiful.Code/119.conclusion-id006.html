<P class=docText><A name="In sum"></A>In sum, I believe that beautiful code must be short, explicit, frugal, and written with consideration for reality. However, I think that the true test of beauty—for code as well as art—is whether the work stands the test of time. Lots of code has been written over the years, but little of it was still in use even several years after it was written. That the CERN library code is still in use more than 30 years after it was written confirms that it is truly beautiful.<A name=I_indexterm15_tt340></A></P></DIV></DIV>
