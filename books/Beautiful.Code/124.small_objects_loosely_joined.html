<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>16.4. Small Objects Loosely Joined</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="The Linux"></A>The Linux driver model shows how the C language can be used to create a heavily object-oriented model of code by creating numerous small objects, all doing one thing well. These objects can be embedded in other objects, all without any runtime type identification, creating a very powerful and flexible object tree. And based on the real-world usage of these objects, their memory footprint is minimal, allowing the Linux kernel to be flexible enough to work from the same code base for tiny embedded systems up to the largest supercomputers in the world.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="this model"></A>The development of this model also shows two very interesting and powerful aspects of the way Linux kernel development works.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="very iterative"></A>First, the process is very iterative. As the requirements of the kernel change, and the systems on which it runs also change, the developers have found ways to abstract different parts of the model to make it more efficient where it is needed. This is responding to a basic evolutionary need of the system to survive in these environments.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of device"></A>Second, the history of device handling shows that the process is extremely collaborative. Different developers come up independently with ideas for improving and extending different aspects of the kernel. Through the source code, others can then see the goals of the developers exactly as they describe them, and then help change the code in ways the original developers never considered. The end result is something that meets the goals of many different developers by finding a common solution that would not have been seen by any one individual.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of development"></A>These two characteristics of development have helped Linux evolve into the most flexible and powerful operating system ever created. And they ensure that as long as this type of development continues, Linux will remain this way.<A name=I_indexterm16_tt360></A></P></DIV></DIV>
