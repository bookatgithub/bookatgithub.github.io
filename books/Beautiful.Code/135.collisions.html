<P class=docText><A name="For any"></A>For any hash table implementation, an important decision is what to do when two keys hash to the same slot. One approach is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>chaining</SPAN> (see <A class=docLink href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Chaining" target=_blank>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Chaining</A><A name="the head"></A>): each slot is the head of a linked list containing all the items that hash to that slot. Python doesn't take this approach because creating linked lists would require allocating memory for each list item, and memory allocations are relatively slow operations. Following all the linked-list pointers would also probably reduce cache locality.<A name=idx-CHP-18-1497></A><A name=idx-CHP-18-1498></A><A name=idx-CHP-18-1499></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name=is></A>The alternative approach is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>open addressing</SPAN> (see <A class=docLink href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Open_addressing" target=_blank>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Open_addressing</A><A name="first slot"></A>): if the first slot <TT>i</TT><A name="contain the"></A> that is tried doesn't contain the key, other slots are tried in a fixed pattern. The simplest pattern is called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>linear probing</SPAN>: if slot <TT>i</TT> is full, try <TT>i+1, i+2, i+3</TT><A name="the table"></A>, and so on, wrapping around to slot 0 when the end of the table is reached. Linear probing would be wasteful in Python because many programs use consecutive integers as keys, resulting in blocks of filled slots. Linear probing would frequently scan these blocks, resulting in poor performance. Instead, Python uses a more complicated pattern:<A name=idx-CHP-18-1500></A><A name=idx-CHP-18-1501></A></P><PRE>	/* Starting slot */
	slot = hash;

	/* Initial perturbation value */
	perturb = hash;
	while (&lt;slot is full&gt; &amp;&amp; &lt;item in slot doesn't equal the key&gt;) {
	    slot = (5*slot) + 1 + perturb;
	    perturb &gt;&gt;= 5;
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="C code"></A>In the C code, <TT>5*slot</TT> is written using <A name=idx-CHP-18-1502></A><A name=as></A>bit shifts and addition as <TT>(slot&lt;&lt;2) + slot</TT>. The perturbation factor <TT>perturb</TT><A name="hash code"></A> starts out as the full hash code; its bits are then progressively shifted downward 5 bits at a time. This shift ensures that every bit in the hash code will affect the probed slot index fairly quickly. Eventually the perturbation factor becomes zero, and the pattern becomes simply <TT>slot=(5*slot)+1</TT><A name="This eventually"></A>. This eventually generates every integer between 0 and <TT>ma_mask</TT><A name="is guaranteed"></A>, so the search is guaranteed to eventually find either the key (on a search operation) or an empty slot (on an insert operation).</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of "></A>The shift value of 5 bits was chosen by experiment; 5 bits minimized collisions slightly better than 4 or 6 bits, though the difference wasn't significant. Earlier versions of this code used more complicated operations such as multiplication or division, but though these versions had excellent collision statistics, the calculation ran slightly more slowly. (The extensive comments in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Objects/dictobject.c</SPAN><A name="history of"></A> discuss the history of this optimization in more detail.)</P></DIV></DIV>
