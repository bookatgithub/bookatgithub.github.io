<P class=docText><A name="The iterator"></A>The iterator is implemented in <A name=idx-CHP-19-1584></A><A name="combination of"></A>NumPy using a combination of macros and function calls. An iterator is created using the C-API function call <TT>it=PyArray_IterNew(ao)</TT><A name="iterator termination"></A>. The check for iterator termination can be accomplished using the macro <TT>PyArray_ITER_NOTDONE(it)</TT><A name="position in"></A>. Finally, the next position in the iterator is accomplished using <TT>PyArray_ITER_NEXT(it)</TT><A name="macro to"></A>, which is a macro to ensure that it occurs inline (avoiding the function call). Ideally, this macro would be an inline function because it is sufficiently complicated. However, because <A name=idx-CHP-19-1585></A><A name="a macro"></A>NumPy is written to ANSI C, which does not define inline functions, a macro is used. Finally, the pointer to the first byte of the current value can be obtained using <TT>PyArray_ITER_DATA(it)</TT><A name="referencing the"></A>, which avoids referencing the structure member <TT>dataptr</TT><A name="changes to"></A> directly (allowing for future name changes to the structure members).<A name=idx-CHP-19-1586></A></P>
<P class=docText>An example of the <A name=idx-CHP-19-1587></A><A name="code snippet"></A>iterator interface is the following code snippet, which computes the largest value in an <SPAN class=docEmphasis>N</SPAN><A name="We assume"></A>-dimensional array. We assume that the array is named <TT>ao</TT><A name=type></A>, has elements of type <TT>double</TT>, and is correctly aligned:<A name=I_indexterm19_tt403></A><A name=I_indexterm19_tt404></A></P><PRE>	#include &lt;float.h&gt;
	double *currval, maxval=-DBL_MAX;
	PyObject *it;
	it = PyArray_IterNew(ao);
	while (PyArray_ITER_NOTDONE(it)) {
	    currval = (double *)PyArray_ITER_DATA(it);
	    if (*currval &lt; maxval) maxval = *currval;
	    PyArray_ITER_NEXT(it);
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="how relatively"></A>This code shows how relatively easy it is to construct a loop for a noncontiguous, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>N</SPAN><A name="the iterator"></A>-dimensional array using the iterator structure. The simplicity of this code also illustrates the elegance of iterator abstraction. Notice how similar the code is to the simple iterator pseudocode shown at the beginning of the earlier section "Iterator Design." Consider also that this code works for arrays of arbitrary dimensions and arbitrary strides in each dimension, and you begin to appreciate the beauty of the multidimensional iterator.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="fast for"></A>The iterator-based code is fast for both contiguous and noncontiguous arrays. However, the fastest contiguous-array loop is still something like:</P><PRE>	double *currval, maxval=-MAX_DOUBLE;
	int size;
	currval = (double *)PyArray_DATA(ao);
	size = PyArray_SIZE(ao);
	while (size--) {
	     if (*currval &gt; maxval) maxval = *currval;
	     currval += 1;
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>The real benefit of the <A name=idx-CHP-19-1588></A><A name="that is"></A>NumPy iterator is that it allows programmers to write contiguous-like code that is still fairly fast without worrying about whether their arrays are contiguous. It should be remembered that forcing a contiguous algorithm has performance costs as well <A name=idx-CHP-19-1589></A><A name="data must"></A>because noncontiguous data must be copied to another array for processing.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=the></A>The speed difference between the <A name=idx-CHP-19-1590></A><A name="fastest contiguous"></A>NumPy iterator solution and the fastest contiguous-case solution could be largely eliminated if a remaining problem with the current NumPy iterator interface could be fixed. The problem is that the <TT>PyArray_ITER_NEXT</TT><A name="macro checks"></A> macro checks each time through the loop whether the iterator can use the simplified contiguous approach. Ideally, this check should be made only once outside of the loop, and then a single approach to finding the next value should be used inside the loop. However, this kind of interface is a bit messy to implement in C. It would require two different macros similar to <TT>ITER_NEXT</TT> and two different <TT>while</TT><A name="to this"></A> loops. As a result, nothing to this effect was implemented in NumPy at the time of the writing of this chapter. People wishing to get the small speed gain available for contiguous cases are assumed to be knowledgeable enough to write the simple loop themselves (bypassing the iterator entirely).</P></DIV></DIV>
