<P class=docText><A name="The iterator"></A>The iterator object in NumPy is an example of a coding abstraction that simplifies programming. Since its construction in 2005, it has been extremely useful in writing <SPAN class=docEmphasis>N</SPAN><A name="on general"></A>-dimensional algorithms that work on general NumPy arrays regardless of whether or not they are contiguous in memory or actually represent noncontiguous <SPAN class=docEmphasis>N</SPAN><A name="other contiguous"></A>-dimensional slices of some other contiguous chunk of memory. In addition, simple modifications to the iterator have made it much simpler to implement some of the more difficult ideas of NumPy, such as optimizing loops (looping over all but the least-striding dimension) and broadcasting.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="a beautiful"></A>Iterators are a beautiful abstraction because they save valuable programmer attention in the implementation of a complicated algorithm. This has been true in NumPy as well. The NumPy implementation of a standard array iterator has made general-purpose code much more pleasant to write and debug, and it has allowed the encapsulation and exposure of some of the important (but hard-to-write) internal features of NumPy, such as broadcasting.<A name=I_indexterm19_tt409></A><A name=I_indexterm19_tt410></A><A name=I_indexterm19_tt411></A><A name=I_indexterm19_tt412></A></P></DIV></DIV>
