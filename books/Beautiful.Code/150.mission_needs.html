<P class=docText><A name="We designed"></A>We designed <A name=idx-CHP-20-1618></A><A name="three primary"></A>CIP to meet three primary needs of the MER mission. By satisfying these needs, CIP provides vital "situational awareness" among mission personnel:<A name=idx-CHP-20-1619></A></P><A name=idx-CHP-20-1620></A><A name=idx-CHP-20-1621></A><A name=idx-CHP-20-1622></A><A name=idx-CHP-20-1623></A><A name=idx-CHP-20-1624></A>

<P class=docList><A name="during any"></A>Keeping everybody synchronized during any large complex mission is critical for success, and MER presented some special time management challenges. Because mission personnel work at locations around the world, CIP displays time in various terrestrial time zones. Because the rovers landed on opposite sides of Mars, there are also two Martian time zones.<A name=idx-CHP-20-1620></A></P>
<P class=docList><A name="ran on"></A>Initially, the mission ran on Mars time, which meant that all scheduled meetings and events (such as data downloads from Mars) were given in the time of one Mars time zone or the other, depending on to which rover the meeting or event pertained. A Martian day is nearly 40 minutes longer than an Earth day, and so relative to Earth time, mission personnel shifted later by that amount of time each day as seen by their families and colleagues who remained on Earth time. This made CIP's time management functions even more important.</P></DD>

<P class=docList><A name="teams "></A>With two rover teams (one per rover) and some people moving between the teams, keeping track of everybody is another critical function. <A name=idx-CHP-20-1621></A><A name="show who"></A>CIP manages a personnel roster and displays schedules (as Gantt charts) that show who is working where, when, and in what role.<A name=idx-CHP-20-1622></A></P>
<P class=docList><A name=idx-CHP-20-1623></A><A name="enables some"></A>CIP also enables some collaboration among mission personnel. They can send out broadcast messages, share analyses of data and image, upload reports, and annotate each other's reports.</P></DD>

<P><SPAN class=docPubcolor><SPAN class=docEmphasis>Data management</SPAN> </SPAN></P></DT>
<DD>
<P class=docList><A name="from the"></A>Getting data and images from the far reaches of the universe is the key to every NASA planetary and deep space mission, and here, too, CIP plays a major role. An array of terrestrial antennas receive the data and images sent by the Mars rovers, and once on Earth, they are transmitted to JPL to be processed and stored in the mission file servers.<A name=idx-CHP-20-1624></A></P>
<P class=docList><A name="the processed"></A>Once the mission managers release the processed data and image files, CIP generates metadata that categorizes the files by various criteria, such as which rover instrument generated the data, which camera took the image, at which setting, using what configuration, when and where, etc. CIP users can then search for the data and images by these criteria and download them from the mission file servers over the Internet onto their personal laptops and workstations.</P>
<P class=docList><A name="CIP also"></A>CIP also implements data security. For example, depending on a user's role (and whether she is a U.S. citizen), certain data and images can be off-limits.</P></DD></DL></DIV></DIV>
