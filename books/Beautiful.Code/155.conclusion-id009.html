<P class=docText><A name="The Collaborative"></A>The Collaborative Information Portal proves that it is possible—yes, even at a huge government agency like NASA—to develop a large complex enterprise software system on time that successfully meets strict requirements for functionality, reliability, and robustness. The Mars rovers have far exceeded expectations, a testament of how well the hardware and the software, both on Mars and on Earth, were designed and built, and of the skills of the builders.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="for a"></A>Unlike smaller programs, beauty for a large application is not necessarily found only in elegant algorithms. For CIP, beauty is in its implementation of a service-oriented architecture and in the numerous simple but well-chosen components—the nails that master software builders know just where to pound in.</P></DIV></DIV>
