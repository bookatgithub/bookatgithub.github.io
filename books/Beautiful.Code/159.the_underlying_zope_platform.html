<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>21.3. The Underlying Zope Platform</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="To understand"></A>To understand why ERP5 is said to be document-driven, it is necessary first to understand how Zope and its Content Management Framework (CMF) work. Zope was originally developed as a web content management environment that provides a series of services to manage the life cycle of web documents. With time, people started to note that it can be also used to implement any kind of web-based application.<A name=idx-CHP-21-1741></A><A name=idx-CHP-21-1742></A><A name=idx-CHP-21-1743></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="web content"></A>In keeping with Zope's web content focus, its CMF is a framework that aims to speed the development of applications based on content types. It provides a series of services associated to these types, such as workflow, searching, security, design, and testing. From Zope, CMF inherits access to the ZODB (Zope Object Database), which provides transactions and undo functionality.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="structural part"></A>CMF implements the structural part of applications through <A name=idx-CHP-21-1744></A><A name="by the"></A>CMF Types, maintained by the <TT>portal_types</TT><A name="turn a"></A> service, which is in turn a kind of registry tool for the recognized types of a given portal. The visible part of a portal type is a document that represents it. To implement behavior, portal types have actions associated with them, composing a workflow, which in turn is the <A name=idx-CHP-21-1745></A><A name="its state"></A>implementation of a business process. An action on a document changes its state and is implemented by a Python script that realizes some business logic; for instance, calculating the total cost of an order. Given this framework, when developing an application in ERP5, we have to think in terms of documents that hold business process data and whose life cycles are kept by workflows, which implement the business process behavior.<A name=idx-CHP-21-1746></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="advantage of"></A>To take advantage of the CMF structure, ERP5 code is divided into a four-level architecture that implements a chain of concept transformations, with configuration tasks at the highest level.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the five"></A>The first level comprises the five conceptual core classes. They have no code, only a skeleton, for the sake of simple documentation:</P><PRE>	class <A name=idx-CHP-21-1747></A>Movement:
	  """
	    Movement of a quantity of a resource in a given variation
	    from a source to a destination.
	  """
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="the real"></A>At the second level is the real core classes' implementation in Python. But here, they are still abstract classes. Still, there is already some <A name=idx-CHP-21-1748></A><A name="Zope stuff"></A>Zope stuff in the classes, and they inherit from <A name=idx-CHP-21-1749></A><A name="every object"></A>XMLObject, which means that every object can be serialized into XML for synchronization or exporting.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="organized into"></A>Class attributes are organized into <SPAN class=docEmphasis>property sheets</SPAN><A name="are configurable"></A>. Property sheets are configurable sets of attributes that facilitate the creation of different object <SPAN class=docEmphasis>views</SPAN><A name="different sets"></A>, potentially manipulated by different sets of class methods. Moreover, these views allow system administrators to set up security in a very flexible and sophisticated way.<A name=idx-CHP-21-1750></A></P>
<P class=docText>For instance, the <TT>SimpleItem</TT> sheet bears <TT>title, short_title</TT>, and <TT>description</TT><A name="users can"></A> attributes. The system administrator can set a security scheme where some users can only view these attributes, while others can write to them:<A name=idx-CHP-21-1751></A><A name=idx-CHP-21-1752></A></P>

It also allows a practice that is very common in <A name=idx-CHP-21-1762></A><A name="All the"></A>ERP5: implementing new portal types without creating new classes in the system. All the programmer has to do is change the appearance of one, because ERP5's core concepts can represent entities of specific business domains.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="Movement can"></A>For instance, a Movement can be used to represent both a cash withdrawal in the finances module and a transference of material from the warehouse to the factory in the inventory module. To do so, we create one portal type to represent a cash withdrawal and another to represent a material transfer, each using the appropriate business terms that appear in the GUI.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=idx-CHP-21-1763></A><A name="also implements"></A>Besides using basic CMF features, ERP5 also implements some extra <A name=idx-CHP-21-1764></A><A name="the most"></A>features to enhance programming productivity. Perhaps the most interesting is the concept of <A name=idx-CHP-21-1765></A><A name="relationship managers"></A>relationship managers, which are objects responsible for keeping the relationships between pairs of objects. Coding relationship logic into each business class is often tedious and error-prone. Also, traditional relationship code spreads the implementation (back-pointers, deletion notifications, and so on) among many business classes, which is more difficult to track, maintain, and keep in sync than mediated approaches.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="service called"></A>In ERP5, a portal service called <A name=idx-CHP-21-1766></A><A name="all the"></A>Portal Categories records all the one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between groups of related objects. Query methods, getters and setters, and relationship code are automatically generated.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=holds></A>This service holds <SPAN class=docEmphasis>base category</SPAN><A name="that collaborate"></A> objects, which connect classes that collaborate to carry out a given business process. For every base category, <A name=idx-CHP-21-1767></A><A name=category></A>ERP5 automatically generates all necessary getters and setters. As an example, the base category <TT>source</TT><A name="reference for"></A> is a reference for objects of the Node type. If, in a given ERP5 implementation, the class Order is configured to have this base category, the system will automatically include all the methods and references necessary to navigate from orders to nodes, and vice versa if desired.<A name=idx-CHP-21-1768></A><A name=idx-CHP-21-1769></A><A name=idx-CHP-21-1770></A></P></DIV></DIV>
