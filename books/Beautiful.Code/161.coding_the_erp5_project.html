<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>21.5. Coding the ERP5 Project</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="The first"></A>The first thing we thought about in creating the Project BT was the main project class. Initially, instead of creating a new class, we decided to simply use Order itself, without change. But after some time, we realized that the business definitions for an order and a project are so different that we should simply create Project as a subclass of Order, without any new code in it, just for the sake of separating concerns. In this design, a project is an object that is described by a series of goals or milestones with one or more tasks <A name=idx-CHP-21-1787></A><A name="of them"></A>associated with each of them.<A name=idx-CHP-21-1788></A><A name=idx-CHP-21-1789></A><A name=idx-CHP-21-1790></A> </P>
<P class=docText><A name="decide how"></A>Then, we had to decide how to implement task management since there are differences between a project and a trade operation. The first thing to consider is that tasks can occur outside projects—for instance, in production planning. Therefore, we consider a task as a composition of task lines, or smaller activities inside a task. In that way, we decouple tasks from projects, allowing them to be used in other situations, while keeping the relation with Project through <TT>source_project</TT> and <TT>destination_project</TT> base categories.<A name=idx-CHP-21-1791></A><A name=idx-CHP-21-1792></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="implemented through"></A>Tasks are implemented through configuration, as we did for Task Report Line in <A class=docLink href="159.the_underlying_zope_platform.html#properties_tab">Figure 21-2</A><A name="of using"></A>, with the difference of using <A name=idx-CHP-21-1793></A><A name=a></A>Order as a metaclass. The creation of a task associated with a <A name=idx-CHP-21-1794></A><A name="shown here"></A>project is shown here:</P>
<DIV class=codeSegmentsExpansionLinks>Code View: <SPAN>Scroll</SPAN> / <A href="javascript:expandCodeSegments()">Show All</A></DIV><PRE class=preFixedWidth>	# Add a task in task_module. Context represents the current <A name=idx-CHP-21-1795></A>project object.
	context_obj = context.getObject()
	# newContent is an <A name=idx-CHP-21-1796></A>ERP5 API method that creates a new content.
	task = context.task_module.newContent(portal_type = 'Task')
	# Set the <A name=idx-CHP-21-1797></A>source_project reference to the task.
	task.setSourceProjectValue(context_obj)
	# Redirect the user to Task GUI, so that the user can edit its properties.
	return context.REQUEST.RESPONSE.redirect(task.absolute_url() + '?portal_status_
	message=Created+Task.')

<P class=docText>Remember that for <A name=idx-CHP-21-1798></A><A name="a certain"></A>retrieving the tasks of a certain project, the programmer needs to use only the base category <TT>source_project</TT><A name="signatures and"></A>. With this category, ERP5 RAD automatically generates signatures and algorithms of accessors. It is interesting to note that the same accessors will be created for both Task and Project. The programmer decides which ones to use through configuration, using the Actions tab shown in <A class=docLink href="159.the_underlying_zope_platform.html#actions_tab">Figure 21-3</A><A name="In that"></A>. In that tab, the programmer can define a new GUI for using the following methods:</P><PRE>	### These accessors are used to navigate from task to project

	# This method returns the related Project reference
	getSourceProject()

	# This method sets the related Project reference
	setSourceProject()

	# This method returns the related Project object
	getSourceProjectValue()

	# This method sets the related Project object
	setSourceProjectValue()

	### These accessors are used to navigate from project to task

	# This method returns references to related tasks
	getSourceProjectRelated()

	# This method is not generated in order to avoid an encapsulation break
	# setSourceProjectRelated()

	# This method returns the related tasks objects
	getSourceProjectRelatedValue()

	# This method is not generated in order to avoid an encapsulation break
	# setSourceProjectRelatedValue()
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="asking where"></A>You must be asking where the <A name=idx-CHP-21-1799></A><A name="attributes and"></A>typical project domain attributes and behavior are. The answer for the attributes, in most cases, is that they are attributes of Movement and some other UBM classes, masked in the GUI with other names. In other cases, the attribute is implemented through a base category, with all the accessors automatically generated as expected.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of this"></A>One example of this is the <A name=idx-CHP-21-1800></A>task <A name=idx-CHP-21-1801></A><A name="tasks that"></A>predecessors, a list of tasks that need to be executed before a given task—a very basic <A name=idx-CHP-21-1802></A><A name="implemented by"></A>project management concept, not found on trade operations. This list is also implemented by a base category named <TT>predecessor</TT><A name="a task"></A>, which links a task to its <A name=idx-CHP-21-1803></A><A name="way because"></A>predecessor in a configurable way because the category takes care of all the code needed.<A name=idx-CHP-21-1804></A></P>
<P class=docText>Workflows implement <A name=idx-CHP-21-1805></A><A name="specialized Order"></A>task behavior. Again, basic Movement and more specialized Order behavior is reused. These workflows manipulate the objects in a way that makes sense for <A name=idx-CHP-21-1806></A><A name="project management"></A>project management, and include some scripts for doing so. Workflows make development easier because they are configurable, and the programmer needs to write scripts only for specific object manipulation.</P>
<P class=docText><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('task_workflow');">Figure 21-5</A> shows the <A name=idx-CHP-21-1807></A><A name="words in"></A>Task workflow. In each box, words in parentheses represent the state ID. Transitions with the <TT>_action</TT><A name="by GUI"></A> suffix are trigged by GUI events; the others are internally trigged by workflow events. For each transition, it is possible to define pre-and post-scripts. These scripts are the ones that will manipulate the objects according to the business logic—in this case, the task execution logic. Task represents the planning view of the process, which essentially goes through <TT>planned, ordered</TT>, and <TT>confirmed</TT> states.</P><A name=task_workflow></A>
