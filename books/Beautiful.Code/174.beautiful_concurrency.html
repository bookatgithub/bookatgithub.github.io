<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0EJDEK>24.1.1. Bank Accounts Using Locks</H4>
<P class=docText><A name=for></A>The dominant technologies used for <A name=idx-CHP-24-1965></A>coordinating concurrent programs today are <SPAN class=docEmphasis>locks</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>condition variables</SPAN><A name="an implicit"></A>. In an object-oriented language, every object has an implicit lock, and the locking is done by <SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="synchronized methods"></A>synchronized methods</SPAN><A name="is the"></A>, but the idea is the same. So, one might define a class for <A name=idx-CHP-24-1966></A><A name="like this"></A>bank accounts something like this:<A name=idx-CHP-24-1967></A><A name=idx-CHP-24-1968></A><A name=idx-CHP-24-1969></A></P><PRE>	class Account {
	  Int balance;
	  synchronized void withdraw( Int n ) {
	    balance = balance - n; }
	  void deposit( Int n ) {
	    withdraw( -n ); }
	}
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="be careful"></A>We must be careful to use a <TT>synchronized</TT> method for <TT>withdraw</TT><A name="do not"></A>, so that we do not get any missed decrements if two threads call <TT>withdraw</TT> at the same time. The effect of <TT>synchronized</TT> is to take a lock on the account, run <TT>withdraw</TT>, and then release the lock.</P>
<P class=docText>Now, here is how we might write the code for <TT>transfer</TT>:</P><PRE>	void transfer( Account from, Account to, Int amount ) {
	  from.withdraw( amount );
	  to.deposit( amount ); }
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="concurrent program"></A>This code is fine for a sequential program, but in a concurrent program, another thread could observe an intermediate state in which the money has left account <TT>from</TT><A name="not arrived"></A> but has not arrived in <TT>to</TT><A name="methods are"></A>. The fact that both methods are <TT>synchronized</TT><A name=Account></A> does not help us at all. Account <TT>from</TT><A name="is first"></A> is first locked and then unlocked by the call to method <TT>withdraw</TT>, and then <TT>to</TT><A name="unlocked by"></A> is locked and unlocked by <TT>deposit</TT><A name="two calls"></A>. In between the two calls, the money is (visibly) absent from both accounts.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=idx-CHP-24-1970></A><A name="finance program"></A>In a finance program, that might be unacceptable. How do we fix it? The usual solution would be to add <A name=idx-CHP-24-1971></A><A name="like so"></A>explicit locking code like so:</P><PRE>	void transfer( Account from, Account to, Int amount ) {
	  from.lock(); to.lock();
	    from.<A name=idx-CHP-24-1972></A>withdraw( amount );
	    to.deposit( amount );
	  from.unlock(); to.unlock() }
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="situation in"></A>But this program is fatally prone to deadlock. In particular, consider the (unlikely) situation in which another thread is transferring money in the opposite direction between the same two <A name=idx-CHP-24-1973></A><A name="thread might"></A>accounts. Then each thread might get one lock and then block indefinitely waiting for the other.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="not always"></A>Once recognized—and the problem is not always so obvious—the standard fix is to put an arbitrary global order on the <A name=idx-CHP-24-1974></A><A name="increasing order"></A>locks, and to acquire them in increasing order. The locking code would then become:</P><PRE>	if from &lt; to
	  then { from.lock(); to.lock(); }
	  else { to.lock(); from.lock(); }
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="That works"></A>That works fine when the full set of required locks can be predicted in advance, but that is not always the case. For example, suppose <TT>from.withdraw</TT><A name="transferring money"></A> is implemented by transferring money out of the <TT>from2</TT> account if <TT>from</TT><A name="enough funds"></A> does not have enough funds. We don't know whether to acquire <TT>from2's</TT><A name="we have"></A> lock until we have read <TT>from</TT><A name="it is"></A>, and by then it is too late to acquire the locks in the "right" order. Furthermore, the very existence of <TT>from2</TT> may be a private matter that should be known by <TT>from</TT>, but not by <TT>transfer</TT>. And even if <TT>transfer</TT> did know about <TT>from2</TT><A name="them into"></A>, the locking code must now take three locks, presumably by sorting them into the right order.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="even more"></A>Matters become even more complicated when we want to <SPAN class=docEmphasis>block</SPAN>. For example, suppose that <TT>transfer</TT> should block if <TT>from</TT><A name="usually done"></A> has insufficient funds. This is usually done by waiting on a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>condition variable</SPAN>, while simultaneously releasing <TT>from</TT><A name="we want"></A>'s lock. It gets much trickier if we want to block until there are sufficient funds in <TT>from</TT><A name=and></A> and <TT>from2</TT> considered together.</P><A name=locks_are_bad></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title id=title-ID0E5IEK>24.1.2. Locks Are Bad</H4>
<P class=docText><A name="long story"></A>To make a long story short, today's dominant technology for concurrent programming—locks and condition variables—is fundamentally flawed.

<P class=docText><A name="shortcoming of"></A>But the fundamental shortcoming of lock-based programming is that <SPAN class=docEmphasis>locks and condition variables do not support modular programming</SPAN><A name="gluing together"></A>. By "modular programming," I mean the process of building large programs by gluing together smaller programs. Locks make this impossible. For example, we could not use our (correct) implementations of <TT>withdraw</TT> and <TT>deposit</TT><A name=implement></A> unchanged to implement <TT>transfer</TT><A name="the locking"></A>; instead, we had to expose the locking protocol. Blocking and choice are even less modular. For example, suppose we had a version of <TT>withdraw</TT><A name="account had"></A> that blocked if the source account had insufficient funds. Then we would not be able to use <TT>withdraw</TT><A name="directly to"></A> directly to withdraw money from A or B (depending on which had sufficient funds), without exposing the blocking condition—and even then it wouldn't be easy.
