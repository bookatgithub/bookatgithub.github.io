<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphSmaller><A name="networked applications"></A>Developing software for networked applications is hard</SPAN><A name="software for"></A>, and developing reusable software for networked applications is even harder. First, there are the complexities inherent to distributed systems, such as optimally mapping application services onto hardware nodes, synchronizing service initialization, and ensuring availability while masking partial failures. These complexities can stymie even experienced software developers because they arise from fundamental challenges in the domain of network programming.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="also master"></A>Unfortunately, developers must also master <SPAN class=docEmphasis>accidental complexities</SPAN><A name="nonportable programming"></A>, such as low-level and nonportable programming interfaces and the use of function-oriented design techniques that require tedious and error-prone revisions as requirements and/or platforms evolve. These complexities arise largely from limitations with the software tools and techniques applied historically by developers of networked software.<A name=idx-CHP-26-2249></A></P>
<P class=docText><A name="user interfaces"></A>Despite the use of object-oriented technologies in many domains, such as graphical user interfaces and productivity tools, much networked software still uses C-level <A name=idx-CHP-26-2250></A><A name="application programmatic"></A>operating system (OS) application programmatic interfaces (APIs), such as the Unix <A name=idx-CHP-26-2251></A><A name=Windows></A>socket API or the Windows <A name=idx-CHP-26-2252></A><A name="networked programming"></A>threading API. Many accidental complexities of networked programming stem from the use of these C-level OS APIs, which are not type-safe, often not reentrant, and not portable across OS platforms. The C APIs were also designed before the wide-spread adoption of modern design methods and technologies, so they encourage developers to decompose their problems functionally in terms of processing steps in a top-down design, instead of using OO design and programming techniques. Experience over the past several decades has shown that <A name=idx-CHP-26-2253></A><A name="functional decomposition"></A>functional decomposition of nontrivial software complicates maintenance and evolution because functional requirements are rarely stable design centers. <SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('CHP-26-FNOTE-1');">[*]</A></SUP><A name=idx-CHP-26-2254></A></P>

As a result, developers can focus on application-specific behavior and properties in their software, rather than repeatedly wrestling with the accidental complexities of programming the low-level networking and OS infrastructure.</P>

<P class=docText><A name="of applying"></A>A key benefit of applying patterns and frameworks <A name=idx-CHP-26-2261></A><A name="is that"></A>to networked software is that they can help developers craft reusable architectures that (1) capture the common structure and behavior in a particular domain, and (2) make it easy to change or replace various algorithms, policies, and mechanisms selectively without affecting other existing parts of the architecture. While most developers of networked software can apply well-designed OO frameworks to their applications, the knowledge of how to create such a framework remains a black art that has historically been learned only by extensive (and expensive) trial and error.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to the"></A>In addition to the conventional challenges of devising a flexible OO design that can expand and contract to meet new requirements, networked software must often run efficiently and scalably in a range of operating environments. The goal of this chapter is to help demystify the black art of OO <A name=idx-CHP-26-2262></A><A name="software by"></A>frameworks for networked software by using a case study to systematically dissect the design and implementation of a representative networked software application.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of patterns"></A>In general, the beauty of our solution stems from its use of patterns and OO techniques to balance key domain forces, such as reusability, extensibility, and performance. In particular, our approach enables developers to identify common design/programming artifacts, thereby enhancing reuse. It also provide a means to encapsulate variabilities in a common and parameterizable way, thereby enhancing extensibility and portability.</P><A name=sample_application_logging_service></A>

<P class=docText><A name="implement any"></A>It is relatively straightforward to implement any one of these combinations, such as running one thread per connection-logging server using socket-based IPC and a thread-level nonrecursive mutex. A one-size-fits-all solution, however, is inadequate to meet the needs of all logging services because different customer requirements and different operating environments can have significantly different impacts on time/space trade-offs, cost, and schedule.
