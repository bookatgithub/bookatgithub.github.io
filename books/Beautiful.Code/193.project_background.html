<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphSmaller><A name="when i"></A>A few years back, when i was a consultant</SPAN><A name="a period"></A>, I went through a period of a year or two when it seemed that every client I spoke with was absolutely certain he needed a Web Services solution for his business. Of course, not many of my clients actually understood what that meant or the reasons why they might need that kind of architecture, but since they kept hearing about Web Services on the Internet, in magazines, and at trade shows, they figured they'd better get on the bus before it was too late.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="not against"></A>Don't get me wrong. I'm not against Web Services. I'm just not a big fan of making technical decisions based solely on whatever happens to be in style at the moment. This chapter will address some of the reasons for using a Web Services architecture, as well as explore some of the options to consider when integrating systems with the outside world.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="you through"></A>In this chapter, I'll walk you through a real-life project that involves exposing a set of services to a business partner, and discuss some design choices that were made along the way. Technologies that were used included Java (J2EE), XML, the Rosettanet E-Business protocol, and a function library used to communicate with a program running on an AS/400 system. I will also cover the use of interfaces and the factory design pattern as I show how I made the system extensible for future distributors who may use different protocols and may need to access different services.</P><A name=project_background></A>
<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>27.1. Project Background</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="call from"></A>The project I'll be discussing in this chapter began with a call from one of our clients: "We need a set of Web Services to integrate our systems with one of our distributors." The client was a large manufacturer of electrical components. The system they were referring to was MAPICS, a manufacturing system written in RPG and running on their AS/400 machines. Their main distributor was upgrading its own <A name=idx-CHP-27-2372></A><A name="and needed"></A>business systems and needed to modify the way it tied into the order management system to check product availability and order status.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="distributor simply"></A>Previously, an operator at the distributor simply connected remotely to the manufacturer's AS/400 system and pressed a "hot key" to access the necessary screens (F13 or F14 as I recall). As you'll see in the code later, the new system I developed for them was named <SPAN class=docEmphasis>hotkey</SPAN><A name="of their"></A>, since that had become part of their common language, much like the way <SPAN class=docEmphasis>google</SPAN><A name="has become"></A> has become a modern-day verb.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="distributor was"></A>Now that the distributor was implementing a new e-business system, it required an automated way to integrate manufacturer data with its own system. Since this was just a single distributor for this client, albeit the largest, the system also needed to allow for the future addition of other distributors and whatever protocols and requirements they might have. Another factor was the relatively low skill level of the staff that would maintain and extend this software. While they were very good in other areas, Java development (as well as any kind of web development) was still very new to them. So, I knew that whatever I built had to be simple and easy to extend.</P></DIV></DIV>
