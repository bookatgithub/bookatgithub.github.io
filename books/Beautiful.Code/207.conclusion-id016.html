<P class=docText><A name="If by"></A>If by any chance, you are forced to debug something, you can strive to make your debugging experience as painless as possible. Being systematic (by following the scientific method) helps a lot. Automating the scientific method helps even more. The best thing you can do, though, is invest effort into your code and your development process. By following the advice in this very book, you will write beautiful code—and, as a side effect, also achieve the most beautiful debugging. And what is the most beautiful debugging? Of course: no debugging at all!</P></DIV></DIV>
