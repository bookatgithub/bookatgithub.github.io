<P class=docText><A name="Emacspeak would"></A>Emacspeak would not exist without Emacs and the ever-vibrant Emacs developer community that has made it possible to do everything from within Emacs. The Emacspeak implementation would not have been possible without Hans Chalupsky's excellent advice implementation for Emacs Lisp.</P>
<P class=docText>Project <SPAN class=docEmphasis>libxslt</SPAN><A name="project has"></A> from the GNOME project has helped breathe fresh life into William Perry's Emacs W3 browser; Emacs W3 was one of the early HTML rendering engines, but the code has not been updated in over eight years. That the W3 code base is still usable and extensible bears testimony to the flexibility and power afforded by Lisp as the implementation language.<A name=I_indexterm31_tt718></A></P></DIV></DIV>
