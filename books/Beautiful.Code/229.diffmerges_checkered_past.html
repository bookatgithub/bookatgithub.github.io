<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>32.6. DiffMerge's Checkered Past</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="We have"></A>We have a record of every change, branch, and merge involving DiffMerge throughout its 10-year history. And it's an interesting record. <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('diffmerges_release_branches');">Figure 32-3</A><A name="view of"></A> offers a thumbnail view of changes to the released versions of DiffMerge. It shows that DiffMerge originated in the mainline (the lowest line on the diagram) and has been branched into over 20 releases. Changes to DiffMerge have occured in the mainline, for the most part. But the thumbnail shows peculiar activity in some of the most recent releases.</P><A name=diffmerges_release_branches></A>

<P class=docText><A name="patches per"></A>A count of DiffMerge's patches per release branch, seen in <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('number_of_patches_applied_to_diffmerge_per_release');">Figure 32-4</A><A name="more intriguing"></A>, is even more intriguing. It shows that DiffMerge was rarely patched after it was released—until the 2004.2 release, that is. Then the post-release patch rate soars, only to abate again in the 2006.2 release. Why are releases 2004.2 through 2006.1 so riddled with patches?</P>
<P class=docText><A name="out as"></A>Here's the backstory: DiffMerge started out as a serviceable but simple program. In its early life, it did little to discriminate between actual merge conflicts and nonconflicting, adjacent-line changes. In 2004, we enhanced DiffMerge to be smarter about detecting and resolving conflicts. As of the 2004.2 release, DiffMerge was certainly more capable, but it was buggy. We got lots of bug reports in 2004.2 and 2005.1—hence the large number of patches. We tried to clean up the code for release 2005.2, but the cleanup resulted in a bug so intractable that we had to restore the 2005.1 version into the 2005.2 release. Then, in 2006, we rewrote the troublesome parts of DiffMerge completely. The rewrite was quite successful, although we did have to tweak it in release 2006.1. Since then, DiffMerge been very stable, and its post-release patch rate is back down to zero.</P><A name=number_of_patches_applied_to_diffmerge_per_release></A>

<P class=docText><A name="it was"></A>So, what went wrong when we rewrote DiffMerge in 2004? We believe it was that we had let the code become incomprehensible. Perhaps our code reviews at the time had lost sight of the Seven Pillars, or perhaps we had skipped some reviews entirely. At any rate, although it continued to pass regression testing, DiffMerge sailed into release branches full of bugs we hadn't seen coming on board.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="no way"></A>We have no way to measure how readable source code is or how well it conforms to the Seven Pillars. But in retrospect, we see a clue that would have leapt out at us had we been looking for it at the time. <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('number_of_diffmerges_if_statements_at_successive_indentation');">Figure 32-5</A> shows a count of <TT>if</TT><A name="nesting levels"></A> statements and their successive nesting levels (as inferred from their indentation depths) in each initial branch of Diff-Merge. By the time we branched DiffMerge for 2004.2, apparently, we had doubled the number of <TT>if</TT><A name="the first"></A> statements in the code. And for the first time, there were <TT>if</TT><A name="s nested"></A>s nested more three levels deep.</P><A name=number_of_diffmerges_if_statements_at_successive_indentation></A>

<P class=docText><A name="as they"></A>Correlation is not causation, as they say, and of course there could have been other contributing factors. The design of the enhancements, the test cases, the other coding constructs—even the size of the source code file—any or all of these could have contributed to the higher rate of errors. But given what we know about deeply nested conditionals and comprehensibility, it's hard not to take this glaring correlation at face value.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of DiffMerge"></A>The 2006 overhaul of DiffMerge was driven by a mandate to overcome indentation. The overhaul replaced deeply nested conditionals with <TT>switch</TT> statements whose <TT>case</TT><A name="defined in"></A> options were values defined in the new <TT>diffGrid</TT><A name="the conditions"></A> decision table. The table, whose layout was designed to be human-readable, itemized all the conditions we were currently handing <SPAN class=docEmphasis>and</SPAN><A name="placeholders for"></A> gave us placeholders for conditions we might eventually want to handle. Thus, we not only replaced troublesome code, we gave ourselves headroom for future enhancements.</P></DIV></DIV>
