<P class=docText><A name="Instead of"></A>Instead of drawing a line through two points and seeing whether the third point is on the line, suppose I drew all three lines and checked to see whether they are really the same line. Actually, I would need to draw only two of the lines, because if line <IMG id="" height=34 alt="" src="images/the_slippery_slope.0.png" width=30 border=0><A name=line></A> is identical to line <IMG id="" height=34 alt="" src="images/the_slippery_slope.1.png" width=27 border=0><A name="be equal"></A>, it must also be equal to <IMG id="" height=38 alt="" src="images/the_slippery_slope.2.png" width=27 border=0><A name="out I"></A>. Furthermore, it turns out I need to compare only the slopes, not the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>y</SPAN><A name="by eye"></A>-intercepts. (Do you see why?) Judging by eye whether two lines are really coincident or form a narrow scissors angle might not be the most reliable procedure, but in the <A name=idx-CHP-33-2806></A><A name=the></A>computational world, it comes down to a simple comparison of two numbers, the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>m</SPAN> values (see <A class=docLink href="javascript:moveTo('testing_collinearity_by_comparing_slopes');">Figure 33-3</A>)<A name=idx-CHP-33-2807></A><A name=idx-CHP-33-2808></A>.</P><A name=testing_collinearity_by_comparing_slopes></A>

<P class=docText><A name="version of"></A>I wrote a new version of <TT>collinear</TT> as follows:</P><PRE>	(defun mm-collinear (px py qx qy rx ry)
	  (equalp (slope px py qx qy)
	          (slope qx qy rx ry)))
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name=no></A>What an improvement! This looks much simpler. There's no <TT>if</TT><A name="expression calling"></A> expression calling attention to the distinguished status of vertical lines; all sets of points are treated the same way.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the simplicity"></A>I must confess, however, that the simplicity and the apparent uniformity are an illusion, based on some Lisp trickery going on behind the scenes. Note that I compare the slopes not with <TT>=</TT><A name="generic equality"></A> but with the generic equality predicate <TT>equalp</TT><A name="works correctly"></A>. The procedure works correctly only because <TT>equalp</TT><A name="the right"></A> happens to do the right thing whether <TT>slope</TT> returns a number or <TT>nil</TT><A name="the same"></A>. (That is, the two slopes are considered equal if they are both the same number or if they are both <TT>nil</TT><A name="language with"></A>.) In a language with a fussier type system, the definition would not be so sweetly concise. It would have to look something like this:</P><PRE>	(defun typed-mm-collinear (px py qx qy rx ry)
	  (let ((pq-slope (slope px py qx qy))
	        (qr-slope (slope qx qy rx ry)))
	    (or (and (numberp pq-slope)
	             (numberp qr-slope)
	             (= pq-slope qr-slope))
	        (and (not pq-slope)
	             (not qr-slope)))))
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="as pretty"></A>This is not nearly as pretty, although even in this more-explicit form, the logic seems <A name=idx-CHP-33-2809></A><A name="the "></A>to me less tortured than the "naïve" version. The reasoning is that <IMG id="" height=34 alt="" src="images/the_slippery_slope.0.png" width=30 border=0><A name=and></A> and <IMG id="" height=34 alt="" src="images/the_slippery_slope.1.png" width=27 border=0><A name="line if"></A> are the same line if the slopes are both numbers and those numbers are equal, or if both slopes are <TT>nil</TT><A name="a clever"></A>. And, anyway, should one penalize a clever Lisp program just because other languages can't do the same trick?</P>
<P class=docText><A name="have been"></A>I would have been willing to call it quits at this point and accept <TT>mm-collinear</TT><A name="version of"></A> as the final version of the program, but for another anomaly that turned up in testing. Both <TT>mm-collinear</TT> and <TT>less-naive-collinear</TT><A name=like></A> could successfully discriminate between collinear points and near misses; a case like <SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN>=(0 0), <SPAN class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN>=(1 0), <SPAN class=docEmphasis>r</SPAN><A name="a challenge"></A>=(1000000 1) was not a challenge. But both procedures failed on this set of points: <SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN>=(0 0), <SPAN class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN>=(0 0), <SPAN class=docEmphasis>r</SPAN>=(1 1).</P>
<P class=docText><A name=what></A>A first question is what <SPAN class=docEmphasis>should</SPAN><A name="is supposed"></A> happen in this instance. The program is supposed to be testing the <A name=idx-CHP-33-2810></A><A name="collinearity of"></A>collinearity of three points, but here <SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN><A name="same point"></A> are actually the same point. My own view is that such points are indeed collinear because a single line can be drawn through all of them. I suppose the opposite position is also defensible, on the grounds that a line of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>any</SPAN><A name="drawn through"></A> slope could be drawn through two coincident points. Unfortunately, the two procedures, as written, do not conform to <SPAN class=docEmphasis>either</SPAN><A name="They return"></A> of these rules. They return nil for the example given above but <TT>t</TT> for the points <SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN>=(0 0), <SPAN class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN>=(0 0), and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>r</SPAN><A name="pathological behavior"></A>=(0 1). Surely this is pathological behavior by anyone's standards.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="arguments to"></A>I could solve this problem by edict, declaring that the three arguments to the procedure must be distinct points. But then I'd have to write code to catch violations of the rule, raise exceptions, return error values, scold criminals, etc. It's not worth the bother.</P></DIV></DIV>
