<H3 class=docSection1Title id=-100000>33.8. Conclusion</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="My adventures"></A>My adventures and misadventures searching for the ideal collinearity predicate do not make a story with a tidy moral. In the end, I believe I stumbled upon the correct solution to my specific problem, but the larger question of how best to find such solutions in general remains unsettled.</P>
<P class=docText>One lesson that <SPAN class=docEmphasis>might</SPAN><A name="my experience"></A> be drawn from my experience is to seek help without delay: some-body out there knows more than you do. You may as well take advantage of the cumulative wisdom of your peers and predecessors. In other words, Google can probably find the algorithm you want, or even the source code, so why waste time reinventing it?</P>
<P class=docText><A name="feelings about"></A>I have mixed feelings about this advice. When an engineer is designing a bridge, I expect her to have a thorough knowledge of how others in the profession have solved similar problems in the past. Yet expertise is not merely skill in finding and applying other people's bright ideas; I want my bridge designer to have solved a few problems on her own as well.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="is how"></A>Another issue is how long to keep an ailing program on life support. In this chapter, I have been discussing the tiniest of programs, so it cost very little to rip it up and start over whenever I encountered the slightest unpleasantness. For larger projects, the decision to throw one away is never so easy. And doing so is not necessarily prudent: you are trading known problems for unknown ones.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="question of"></A>Finally, there is the question of just how much the quest for "beautiful code" should be allowed to influence the process of programming or software development. The mathematician G. H. Hardy proclaimed, "There is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics." Do aesthetic principles carry that much weight in computer science as well? Here's another way of asking the same question: do we have any guarantee that a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Book</SPAN>-quality program exists for every well-formulated <A name=idx-CHP-33-2823></A>computational problem? Maybe <SPAN class=docEmphasis>The Book</SPAN> has some blank pages.</P></DIV></DIV>
