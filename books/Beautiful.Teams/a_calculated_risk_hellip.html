<h3 id="title-IDA54CKR" class="docSection1Title">7.2. A Calculated Risk &#8230;</h3>
<p class="docText">It's December, and Da Bomb is in full swing. The secret is out,
        too&mdash;at least within the company: a few weeks before, the executive VP
        of engineering, Delon Dotson, announced the project to the engineering
        staff, and Michael announced it to the rest of the company at a
        Chairman's Chat shortly thereafter. MP3.com was now in full "music
        acquisition" mode, buying all the CDs it could get its hands on,
        including offering employees $20 for each CD from their collection
        that they were willing to part with. The goal: acquire the 10,000 most
        popular CDs ever sold so that when My.MP3.com users buy a CD from a
        partnering vendor, or attempt to "Beam" (i.e., verify) a CD they have
        in their collection, there's a high chance that we'll have that music
        in our database. This is a tougher problem than expected because it
        turns out that for each CD there may be multiple versions. Our "Beam
        It" software is refined enough to detect this when you attempt to
        verify a CD from your collection, and if we don't have that particular
        version of that album, our software won't allow you to listen to it
        from our servers. This is good from a security standpoint&mdash;you can't
        listen to music you don't own&mdash;but bad from an end-user perspective: "I
        can't believe they don't have <span class="docEmphasis">Dark Side of the
        Moon</span>!" Meanwhile, there are at least eight different
        versions of <span class="docEmphasis">Dark Side of the Moon</span>, and even
        though the music on each one is identical to the listener, the master
        tapes were slightly different: enough that the data didn't match when
        comparing the files.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0161"></a></p>
<p class="docText">It turns out that 10,000 CDs is not just a nice round number:
        unbeknownst to us, Robin Richards, the president of MP3.com, has
        approved Da Bomb on the condition that only 10,000 CDs be initially
        loaded into the system. Why 10,000? Well, Robin has done the numbers,
        and with $400 million in the bank and an expected maximum fine of
        $10,000 to $25,000 per copyright infringement, even if we do get sued
        and somehow lose, we'll still have money in the bank. It is a
        calculated risk, but one worth taking: if My.MP3.com takes off,
        MP3.com has a huge lead on all of its competitors and will dominate
        the industry.</p>
<p class="docText">Meanwhile, the development teams are still going full steam
        ahead in intense development and QA cycles, and people are starting to
        get frazzled. Christopher Giles is the only engineer
        developing the new My.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0162"></a>MP3.com&mdash;as he had been responsible for the pre-Bomb
        <a name="idx-CHP-7-0163"></a>incarnation of the site&mdash;and the task has been daunting,
        including a complete redesign of the user interface, adding user
        handling and tracking, optimizing and reoptimizing the scripts so that
        they do not completely hose the database or take more than a second or
        two to load, etc. On top of this, it is apparent that
        Christopher&mdash;never one to be particularly laid back to begin
        with<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-7-FNOTE-2">[]</a></sup>&mdash;is chafing under David's insistent, detail-oriented (is
        that code for "micromanaging"? I'm not sure &#8230;) management style. For
        his part, David is on a mission to keep everything and everybody on
        schedule, and he's not shy about confronting you when he's concerned
        that the schedule isn't going to hold.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-7-FNOTE-2">[]</a></sup> Christopher had a penchant for not waiting more than 30
            seconds&mdash;from the moment music had come out of your computer
            speakers at the lowest possible volume&mdash;to walk straight over to
            your cube and say in the most annoyed voice possible, "Could you
            turn that off? People are trying to work." Meanwhile, we're
            working at a music company and this sometimes requires us to have
            music on. I have heard that he was the sole reason we got offices,
            as opposed to cubes, when we moved into the engineering
            building.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Things finally come to a head when Christopher calls David an
        "autocrat," and a minute later they disappear into a conference room.
        Fifteen feet away I can hear the heated discussion from behind that
        closed door. Ten minutes later, they emerge and it's clear that
        Christopher is not happy: this isn't necessarily anything new, as he's
        a bit of a sourpuss to begin with (although a nice enough guy once you
        get to know him better and/or don't have to work with him), but this
        time he's even unhappier than usual. David does not look too out of
        sorts, but he's a tough one to read (Degenhardt says: "David McCollum
        is an enigma wrapped inside a mystery," and I don't think he's too far
        off). And honestly, in two years of working with David, I think this
        is the only time that I saw him lose his cool with someone. This isn't
        to say that he couldn't hold a hard line or be insistent about what he
        wanted (or that you were wrong), but the man has an amazing ability to
        avoid direct conflict with people, usually by spinning the topic of
        discussion up to a high enough level of abstraction that there is no
        longer any disagreement. And this makes me wonder: what was it about
        Christopher Giles that made David lose his cool? Was it someone
        directly confronting him and his authority? Or was it something
        deeper, as I don't think I had ever seen David hound someone as hard
        as he did with Christopher.</p>
<p class="docText">One thing I have to consider is a point that a few people
        (including David) had mentioned to me about the <a name="idx-CHP-7-0164"></a>MP3.com <a name="idx-CHP-7-0165"></a>hiring process. At the time when MP3.com was hiring five
        or six engineers a week, the fundamental questions asked after a
        candidate had made the rounds were: "Can you work with this person?"
        and "Do you respect their intellect?" While in and of themselves these
        questions aren't any different from what you'd find in many
        workplaces, it seems like MP3.com took them to heart a bit more than
        most. They were explicit and at the front of your consciousness during
        the entire interview, resulting in more than one amazing candidate
        being passed on just because they were "octagonal pegs" that weren't
        the right fit for MP3.com. <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-7-FNOTE-3">[]</a></sup> There were a lot of criteria that could make you a good
        fit, interest in open source tools and/or a willingness to learn them
        being a primary one, but it really came down to a
        personal assessment and the desire not to settle on anyone who was
        less than A level.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-7-FNOTE-3">[]</a></sup> <span class="docEmphasis">Octagonal pegs</span> is such a great term
            that I can't steal it: David Dudas is responsible for it.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">In many ways, Christopher did not fit into the culture at
        <a name="idx-CHP-7-0166"></a>MP3.com, and he seemed like a bit of a loner and an odd
        man out. This makes me curious if some of the interaction between him
        and David wasn't dictated by a lack of fundamental respect stemming
        from differing world views. This lack of respect came from both
        parties; I suspect that accounted for at least a portion of the
        friction. Needless to say, I think that episode marked the beginning
        of the end for Christopher, as he would leave for Microsoft a few
        short months later.</p>
