<h3 id="643999-935" class="docSection1Title">30.1. A Gem from the Computing Past</h3>
<p class="docText">Close your eyes and travel back&mdash;using your memory if you have
        been in the computer industry long enough, and your imagination if you
        have not&mdash;to a simpler and more innocent time when a small computer
        company could create and market a complete system from the ground up.
        In the 1970s and 1980s, with computer chips and other components as
        building blocks and a total staff of just a few hundred people, a
        company I will call Edom Engineering manufactured Unix systems with
        unusually powerful data processing capabilities. It could be
        considered a supplier of low-cost systems meeting high-end needs, and
        was very popular with small scientific and engineering labs whose
        research aspirations outpaced their budgets.</p>
<p class="docText">The eccentric personalities at Edom Engineering, many of whom
        you'll encounter during this story, made work constantly stimulating
        and sometimes pleasurable. I treasure my memories of these people,
        with whom I shared so many critical moments. Many of them are likely
        to read this story and recognize the incident I'll describe. I hope
        they forgive me if their recollection of the events differs from mine;
        I have done my best to reproduce the feelings and facts of a time that
        is more than two decades removed from now.</p>
<p class="docText">Edom Engineering occupied a low-slung warehouse-like facility on
        Boston's Other Technology Highway (Route 495, as opposed to the more
        famous Route 128). The bottom floor held a manufacturing facility and
        the top floor contained the engineering teams. The company was a class
        society, but a harmonious and very efficient one. A range of hardware
        from motherboards to data acquisition devices were created from
        scratch and tightly bound to specialized operating system software,
        compilers, and other tools.</p>
<p class="docText">Not many teams nowadays hold the kinds of
        conversations I sat in on, where compiler writers discuss bugs in
        register allocation heuristics and how to squeeze an extra bit of
        precision from a square root function. The engineers at Edom
        Engineering, including a high percentage of doctorates, were a smart
        bunch with a wonderful esprit de corps.</p>
<p class="docText">Our compiler group was tasked with reproducing all the features
        of the classic, industry-dominant FORTRAN compiler that Digital
        Equipment Corporation produced for its VAX line. One engineer got so
        carried away with this mission that she discovered the algorithm used
        <a name="idx-CHP-30-0914"></a>by Digital's random number generator (actually, of
        course, a pseudorandom number generator) and made sure our RAND
        function produced the same sequence of numbers as the Digital
        library's RAND function.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember asking her, "Did the project requirements really make
        it necessary for you to produce the same exact random numbers?"</p>
<p class="docText">She shrugged and answered, "I just figured it out, and decided I
        might as well make our library conform as much as possible."</p>
<p class="docText">It was just such a combination of flamboyant showmanship,
        competitive zeal, and the sheer fun of creation that led Edom
        Engineering staff to retool the Unix operating system and all other
        software components to maximize the effectiveness of the company's
        well-regarded hardware. Our marketing staff boasted that we had the
        industry's broadest support for a wide range of features in both
        System V and BSD Unix, the two fundamental sources for Unix systems of
        that time.</p>
<p class="docText">Projects were organized around a cross-disciplinary model that
        became popular in the 1970s, largely influenced by Digital's adoption
        of matrix management. Engineers on each team interacted intimately
        with the marketing person, tech support staff, and technical writers
        who worked on the project. These contributors attended all project
        meetings and checked in with each other on almost an hourly
        basis.</p>
<p class="docText">The company's concern for good manuals and respect for
        documentation staff led me to join the firm as a technical writer. I
        was associated most closely with the compiler team, but enjoyed the
        chance to work on a variety of projects.</p>
<p class="docText">And indeed, Edom Engineering's manuals were known throughout the
        industry for the same high quality as the rest of the company's
        offerings. Programmers could actually understand our manual on device
        drivers, and could produce a working driver after reading it. My first
        year was devoted to documenting the entire <a name="idx-CHP-30-0915"></a>FORTRAN language, which looks like an exercise in
        redundancy, but was actually necessary because we had bulked up
        standard FORTRAN with lots of VAX extensions and our own
        enhancements.</p>
<p class="docText">Our management style was also fairly relaxed and democratic for
        those times. We held on to a scruffy start-up culture even as our
        staff grew past 300. But this grounding in openness harbored a
        tectonic fault: top managers were closer to their investors than their
        employees. A recent merger had lengthened the distance between
        investors and line staff even more. This distance caused chronic
        grumbling and unkind jokes among the lower echelons
        of the company. But for important engineering decisions, the managers
        and investors were always smart enough to listen to their preeminent
        technical staff.</p>
<p class="docText">In Edom Engineering's heyday, it seemed there was nothing our
        engineers couldn't do. When the thread paradigm established itself as
        an important element of programming, the compiler team added standard
        <a name="idx-CHP-30-0916"></a>pthreads support to the C compiler in just a few months,
        and the graphics group was well on its way to making calls thread-safe
        in the gigantic <a name="idx-CHP-30-0917"></a>Motif library (the leading graphics library on Unix at
        that time) when their project fell victim to the industry crunch that
        the company ran into during the late 1980s.</p>
<p class="docText">It is this economic crisis, and the self-destructive reaction
        taken by management, to which I now turn. Our industry suffered the
        kind of change that is grievously disruptive but by no means rare&mdash;the
        kind of paradigm shift that my readers will probably go through
        several times in their careers, no matter what field they work in&mdash;so
        this change deserves a few paragraphs to help you understand how
        limited the options left to us were.</p>
