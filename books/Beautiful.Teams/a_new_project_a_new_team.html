<h3 id="643999-889" class="docSection1Title">7.1. A New Project, A New Team</h3>
<p class="docText">Fast-forward three months and <a name="idx-CHP-7-0147"></a>MP3.com has moved to a <a name="idx-CHP-7-0148"></a>new location: two buildings overlooking the scenic 805
        freeway. Of the two, only one is inhabited and even it is still under
        construction as offices are framed and erected in the empty spaces, a
        chain link fence is put up to keep the musicologists from eating
        anyone, and the building is art-i-fied&mdash;one entire hallway is tagged
        with graffiti while another is textured with chunky dried caulk in a
        peanut-butter cookie crisscross painted gold. You get the picture:
        these buildings are becoming <span class="docEmphasis">ours</span>. The second
        building is under construction and before long will house the
        engineering department, which is already 50 or 60 people strong and
        probably 40% to 50% of the total company. For the time being, however,
        we're in cubicle purgatory.</p>
<p class="docText">It's early October, and for the past three months I've been
        working closely with Sander van Zoest, a crazy Dutchman and one of the
        MP3.com founders&mdash;his title is High Geek&mdash;and David Story, programmer
        extraordinaire. The two are as much alike as they are different:
        Sander is 23 with rocking blue hair, doesn't ever seem to sleep, and
        is someone you would perhaps run across at one of San Diego's
        Goth/industrial nights wearing almost see-through silver pants. He's
        striking both in the way that he speaks&mdash;waiting for you to finish and
        making sure you have nothing more to say before carefully giving you
        an insightful commentary on either why the system is designed in that
        particular way or how the particular architecture has evolved over its
        development cycle, resulting in its current incarnation, complete with
        various hints at what might make sense for the next version&mdash;and his
        demeanor, which is just slightly not American (and yet is,
        somehow).</p>
<p class="docText">David, on the other hand, is 39 years young with a twinkle in
        his eye that belies the fact that he'd probably be happier riding
        around on BMX bikes with his kids all day as opposed to living in the
        grown-up world. Yet not only is he a tireless worker who appears to
        view every project with a sort of ongoing curiosity, poking and
        prodding until he solves the puzzle, but he exudes a calm which seems
        impenetrable. He is fit, dressed in nice, pressed shorts and collared
        shirt, and drives his barely-street-legal motocross bike to work on
        most days.</p>
<p class="docText">Their demeanors, appearances, and work habits are yin to the
        other's yang, but both are complete professionals: taking the time to
        design elegant architectures, designing to published standards when
        they exist (or at least aware of the fact that they're skirting the
        standard and why), writing and submitting RFCs when it makes sense to,
        and generally taking the time to "Do Things Right," if for no other
        reason than that they'll be portable and easier to maintain
        later.</p>
<p class="docText">This seems to be one of the common threads among the MP3.com
        engineers: they were, to a T, talented professionals who got things
        done, not afraid to roll up their sleeves and jump right in and come
        up with innovative solutions. I can't tell you how many people arrived
        at MP3.com and had absolutely no direction their first day or five as
        things were just going too fast for everyone around them. What
        happened next, however, was amazing and unique: they jumped in and
        made work for themselves. It was not a matter of "What am I supposed
        to be doing?" but rather "What can I do??!" as you wanted to be a
        part of the living, breathing organism around you.
        Besides, that's why people came to <a name="idx-CHP-7-0149"></a>MP3.com: to <span class="docEmphasis">work</span>. They were jazzed
        at what the company was doing, at the team assembled around them, at
        the breakneck pace of just about everything: the energy was addictive.
        And this is exactly how I started working with David and
        Sander.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">"Where do you think you will be when you are listening to your
          music 10 years from now?"&mdash;Michael Robertson, CEO of MP3.com</p>
<p class="docText">"In prison."&mdash;Christopher Giles, software engineer and fiddle
          player</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">And so it was that one early October day, the three of us&mdash;David,
        Sander, and I&mdash;got pulled into a meeting room with our manager, David
        McCollum, and three other engineers: Christopher Giles, Josh Stevens,
        and Mike Oliphant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">"Now this is a top-secret <a name="idx-CHP-7-0150"></a>project and what we are about to talk about cannot
          leave this room. OK? OK. You know that we have been talking to the
          music labels for some time, trying to work out a way to license
          their content. Unfortunately, we've been getting nowhere. Well, I
          was just in a meeting with Michael [Robertson], and he has a vision
          for how we can move forward, legally. He wants to build a site which
          allows people to leverage their existing music collection, meaning
          the CDs they already own, from our site &#8230;."&mdash;David McCollum, director
          of engineering</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Say what??!</p>
<p class="docText">"How is that legal?" someone asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"Michael and the legal team are working on that and think that
        they have a legal solution &#8230;."</p>
<p class="docText">And so it began.</p>
<p class="docText">You see, up until this point in time, MP3.com had been a website
        for the independent music artist. Any musician could create an
        "artist" page and upload his music, and <span class="docEmphasis">presto</span>!
        People could listen to and (if the musicians allowed it) download the
        music. All for free! Not only that, but you could also upload album
        art and sell CDs from our site, pulling in 40% or so of the price you
        chose to sell it at. These D.A.M. CDs were pressed on the fly using
        just-in-time manufacturing, so there was no cost to you and our costs
        were covered within our percentage of the sale price.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-7-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-7-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> <a name="idx-CHP-7-0151"></a>D.A.M. (Digital Automatic Music) CD-Rs were not
            audio CDs, but rather contained MP3 files. This meant that the CD
            could not be played on some traditional players, but more than 72
            minutes of music could be placed on it.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">That's the overview&mdash;a site designed to allow artists to
        self-promote, remove the overhead of creating a music product, and
        eliminate the middleman (i.e., the record label) who was taking a huge
        cut of their sales&mdash;but it doesn't capture the buzz and excitement
        generated by the site. Nor does it capture what went into the daily
        operation of the company: a full staff of musicologists, who in
        addition to their other duties, tirelessly listened to track after
        track of uploaded music for copyright infringements (and trust me when
        I say that some of that music was not pretty), the
        marketing and sales teams who somehow found ways for us to slow down
        our burn rate, a legal department that did its best to keep us out of
        trouble (a difficult proposition at best), and last but not least, the
        engineering that went into keeping the site up every day.</p>
<p class="docText">And when I say "engineering," I mean it. Keeping a website that
        hosts 200,000 songs and 40,000 artists running is no small feat, and
        so <a name="idx-CHP-7-0152"></a>MP3.com&mdash;with $400 million in the bank&mdash;invested in
        quality people and an engineering team which was half the size of the
        company.</p>
<p class="docText">What did all this mean? Well, three months after the IPO, the
        engineering team&mdash;everyone involved&mdash;had made substantial inroads in
        creating a very scalable infrastructure. Don't get me wrong, the
        frantic pace and energy hadn't slowed down, but things seemed to be &#8230;
        stable. And you'll note that I'm referring to the "engineering team"
        here as opposed to specific individuals, as I was discussing before.
        It sounds cheesy, but even though the engineering team had grown to be
        fairly huge (50 or 60 people), it really was a pretty cohesive unit;
        at least to the extent that none of the individual groups could have
        survived without the expertise of the other groups.</p>
<p class="docText">Heck, the whole company was pretty cohesive, with weekly
        companywide meetings dubbed the "Chairman's Chat" where our CEO,
        Michael Robertson, would address the entire company, introduce
        <a name="idx-CHP-7-0153"></a>new people, and generally let us know what had been
        happening from a "big picture" perspective. It was one of those things
        where even if you didn't know everyone in the company, even if you
        didn't know everything that was going on, you still had some sense of
        what senior management was doing, and specifically, that they were
        doing <span class="docEmphasis">something</span>. You might not
        <span class="docEmphasis">agree</span> with what they were doing, but at least you
        knew that they were doing something. Don't get me wrong, these "chats"
        were at least partly pep talks and, later on, partly propaganda to
        keep people focused and drinking the Kool-Aid, but they worked. And
        just like a family, they helped us rally around each other, especially
        when things started taking a turn for the worse. But that wouldn't be
        for a while yet &#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">And listening to Michael (as he was generally referred to) was
        always interesting because he is a visionary. You might not always
        agree with his vision or his implementation, but he is able to think
        in terms of the bigger picture and think outside the box. This can be
        a mixed blessing at times, as he is very passionate about his ideas
        and he's not afraid to tell you when you're wrong. This always made it
        a bit scary to interact with him, as you never knew what you were
        going to get: was it going to be the rush of knowing your ideas were
        being heard by The Boss and that you might be given carte blanche? Or
        was it going to be the screaming, berating Michael, someone who there
        was no arguing with&mdash;at least not if you valued your job&mdash;who no amount
        of reason could reach, no matter how you chose your words, no matter
        what evidence you had to the contrary: his word was the final
        one.</p>
<p class="docText">This, of course, was the rush and what made Michael great: his
        passion, his clear vision, his ability to envision a product seemingly
        in its entirety and express it, or to take a nugget of an idea and
        explore it, riffing off one idea after another until it had become a
        product.</p>
<p class="docText">And inherent in all of this were the
        confidence and certainty that took these ideas to fruition. It could
        be an emotional roller coaster, but there was no greater high than
        when you were bringing one of these ideas to life.</p>
<p class="docText">So, when David McCollum began to tell the six of us about
        Michael's idea, on some level it wasn't terribly surprising: Michael
        had a vision for the direction the company would go in, a vision for a
        path to profitability, and David was asking us to assess it and
        determine whether we could pull it off. The idea itself was still
        fairly fresh and nebulous, like a concept you're talking through, but
        the gist of it was to roll out "a service which has three legs. The
        first leg is that you should be able to leverage your existing music
        collection (you don't want to have to repurchase anything). The second
        leg is that if you buy <a name="idx-CHP-7-0154"></a>new music, it should be immediately available for you to
        listen to, and the third leg is that you should be able to listen to
        your music wherever you are and on any device you want to listen to it
        from."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">MP3.com's killer app: an online service that allows
        you to manage all of your music in one place, accessible from
        anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="docText">We were listening intently, trying to figure out where this was
        going, when David let us know exactly where: we were going to rip
        (i.e., copy a music file from a CD onto your hard drive) a whole slew
        of CDs, and if users could prove they owned that CD, we would allow
        them access to it via our site.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0155"></a></p>
<p class="docText">To explain the argument, dubious as it may or may not have been,
        as to why ripping tens of thousands of CDs seemed at all congruous
        with any sort of valid business model while all around the nation (and
        probably the world) the Recording Industry Association of America
        (RIAA) was fighting tooth and nail the notion that even creating an
        MP3 file, for <span class="docEmphasis">whatever</span> use, was illegal, one has
        to jump back to the ripe old year of 1976, when the first video
        recorder&mdash;the Betamax&mdash;was released by Sony. Long story short, Sony was
        sued for copyright infringement because the
        Betamax allowed you to record TV shows, movies, or whatever was on
        TV&mdash;something that had not been possible before and which was viewed as
        an infringement of the broadcaster's rights. Sony won the legal
        battle, and a concept called "time shifting" emerged from the court
        decision which states that a user can store copyrighted content to a
        more convenient medium for use at a later time. This is also known as
        the "Betamax Decision."</p>
<p class="docText">The corollary to "time shifting" is "space shifting," and is the
        concept that you can make a copy of certain media you already
        "own"&mdash;CDs, DVDs, records&mdash;to another form of media such as copying a CD
        to a tape. This concept was successfully argued in a case brought
        against an MP3 player manufacturer&mdash;Diamond Multimedia Systems&mdash;by the
        RIAA, which unsuccessfully argued that copying music from a CD to an
        MP3 player was a violation of copyright law.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">A poster from MP3.com that exemplifies the extensive
        propaganda campaign that was part of the RIAA's attempt to quash music
        pirating.</span></p>
<p class="docText">Based on these precedents, someone (presumably our legal
        department) OKed the idea that we could rip a number of CDs and make
        them available to users who could prove that they owned the content.
        We were merely allowing them to "space-shift" content that they
        already owned. There was some additional discussion, but as Josh
        Stevens puts it, "We all put on our Junior Lawyer hats and set about
        trying to design a system that would be secure and prevent anyone who
        didn't own the content from getting access to that music." You see,
        from our perspective, we thought that as long as we could keep the
        system secure, we wouldn't get sued, whereas if the system wasn't
        secure and they (the RIAA) determined that music could unlawfully be
        accessed, we were in trouble.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0156"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Mind you, there was still quite a bit of grumbling about
        possible lawsuits, even among the six of us. In fact, I may have been
        one of the only people who did believe the party line and just
        accepted that what we were being asked to do was legal. They said the
        lawyers had checked it, and, well, I'm no lawyer, so I went with it.
        Whoops! Yet, perhaps there were other factors involved, first and
        foremost being the unreality field that seemed to surround
        many of the projects we undertook at <a name="idx-CHP-7-0157"></a>MP3.com. I was mainly just happy to be working in this
        amazing environment with so many talented folks all around me.</p>
<a name="the_plan"></a><p><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td>
<h2 class="docSidebarTitle">The Plan</h2>
<div><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div><p class="docList">Rip 10,000 of the most popular CDs (based on historic

</td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText">And so we started designing a system that would allow users to
        manage and stream music, whether the artists were on MP3.com or were
        from major labels (whose CD you physically owned). The system would be
        based upon our existing My.MP3.com website, which allowed you to do
        something similar with MP3.com artists. My.MP3.com would get a
        facelift and we would need to add significant functionality to lock
        down the <a name="idx-CHP-7-0158"></a>new content, but it was a good starting point.
        Meanwhile, we would be taking our first foray into software, offering
        a tool that My.MP3.com users could download and use to verify that
        they owned a particular CD.</p>
<p class="docText">The new website would be still be dubbed "My.MP3.com," but the
        code name for the project was "Da Bomb": a reference both to the atom
        bomb, as we expected this service to change the music industry forever
        (much like the atom bomb had changed warfare forever), and to the
        Parliament lyric from P-Funk for a music reference (and 'cuz we're
        cool, dig?).</p>
<p class="docText">Independent of this, but at about the same time as Da Bomb was
        taking off, I started working on a side project with another engineer,
        Brian Degenhardt, involving user and concurrency tracking. Long story
        short(er), MP3.com had no way of checking if a user was currently
        playing a song or not. We passed around browser cookies, so we knew
        your MP3.com ID, but the server farm had no idea if you were logged in
        to multiple computers concurrently or not; it just logged that you had
        requested a song at a certain time. This was one of those projects
        where no one asked us to do it&mdash;and actually, different people told me
        that it wasn't something we needed&mdash;but we just decided to do it
        anyway. I went around and polled the people I thought might be able to
        use this data, and then Brian and I spent a few late nights around a
        whiteboard determining the project requirements and scoping out how
        the pieces were going to work together. It was a blast: we were both
        pretty young, and this was&mdash;I'm pretty sure&mdash;our first "big" project
        that we started designing from scratch. There was a buzz: we were
        modifying how all of the music on our site was served to end users. By
        ourselves. Because we were <span class="docEmphasis">allowed</span> to. That's
        just cool.</p>
<p class="docText">Brian was just hilarious to work with, too.
        He was a complete goof, straight out of college, and had this
        positive-world outlook that manifested itself by him just talking
        excitedly about the geekiest of Apache internals to anyone who would
        listen, able to come up with the funniest&mdash;yet dead accurate&mdash;analogies
        that distilled what was actually going on down to a silly caricature
        involving, "See, you've got this elephant, and it wants to pick up the
        peanut, but it can't because &#8230;." Yeah. A mile a minute and never
        stopping until he's figured out just why Apache isn't doing exactly
        the right thing that he wants it to do. I actually have no clue how we
        started working on the <a name="idx-CHP-7-0159"></a>project together. Sander was probably up to his neck in
        other "High Geek" activities and either he directed me to talk to
        Brian, or somehow Brian and I just started talking to each other
        across the cubicle wall as we were both generally there pretty late.
        This was what working at <a name="idx-CHP-7-0160"></a>MP3.com was all about: being empowered to work on crazy
        stuff with cool people, figuring out how to solve a problem, and then
