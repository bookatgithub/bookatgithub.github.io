<h3 id="title-IDAREY1F" class="docSection1Title">30.7. Anticipating 21st-Century Management</h3>
<p class="docText">It was only while writing up my recollections as a chapter for
        <span class="docEmphasis">Beautiful Teams</span> that I reckoned there was
        something deeper and more significant about my email blast than merely
        letting off steam. I think Alan and I were exploring a new management
        style and the role of a new communications technology. The
        significance wouldn't emerge for 20 years, until management
        consultants dubbed it a new trend in corporate behavior.<a name="idx-CHP-30-0926"></a></p>
<p class="docText">I pointed out at the beginning of this chapter that Edom
        Engineering management maintained a respect for engineers and a
        tolerance for their opinionated way of expressing themselves, a legacy
        of the company's start-up days. Something on Longjump caused this to
        break down&mdash;probably the reluctance of the CEO to argue with investors
        and for George to argue with the CEO, along with the new lines of
        command brought in by our merger. The engineers at the grass roots
        were not prepared to organize themselves to preserve their
        decision-making power in the face of this breakdown in corporate
        culture. But another force, technological in nature, stepped in to
        offer an alternative power arrangement.</p>
<p class="docText">We were living in a period before mass online participation,
        when the World Wide Web ran on only a few dozen sites. Yet already,
        online communities had experimented with a <a name="idx-CHP-30-0927"></a>grassroots political activity that dispensed with
        traditional leaders and party centers. Although Howard Rheingold's
        influential book <span class="docEmphasis">The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the
        Electronic Frontier</span> (Addison-Wesley) was not published
        until 1993,<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-30-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> and John Perry Barlow didn't release his Declaration of
        the Independence of Cyberspace (now seen as something of a period
        piece) until 1996, knowledge of Rheingold's WELL was widespread among
        Internet users at the time I worked on Longjump, and I was already
        building a different way for people to work together with far-flung
        colleagues through email forums run by Computer Professionals for
        Social Responsibility.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-30-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> Alan was later to publish a critique of this book, but that
            doesn't detract from my observation that he was making use of
            online communication and noticing much of its potential.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">I am convinced that Alan's challenge to send out my views
        through email was a response to the power he saw dormant in <a name="idx-CHP-30-0928"></a>digital communications. Alan does not remember this time
        in his career well enough to say whether he was consciously working
        through its potential as I babbled away about deadlines and bug
        reports in his office, but the effect of our conspiracy was to let
        loose into the environment an unscheduled experiment in grassroots
        participation. My immediate enthusiasm showed
        that I, too, prepped by my political work online, was equipped to
        create the experimental organism we unleashed.</p>
<p class="docText">The results of the experiment validated the premise. Digital
        networks are powerful enablers for democratic action, at least among
        groups of people that already have ties. In such a degenerate
        corporate environment, so constrained financially, we couldn't expect
        miraculous results. The observed effects on employee morale were the
        best outcome we could hope for. But one could easily see how the same
        use of technology could actually support constructive project
        management in a healthier company, if deployed at any earlier stage
        and supported by enlightened management and social norms.</p>
<p class="docText">The vision that Alan and I presented that day&mdash;unconsciously in
        my case, but perhaps consciously in his&mdash;now fills the pages of
        management texts. It has become, in the wake of the
        <span class="docEmphasis">Cluetrain Manifesto</span> (by Christopher Locke, Rick
        Levine, et al.; Basic Books), Eric Von Hippel's <span class="docEmphasis">The Sources
        of Innovation</span> (Oxford University Press), and other books
        expounding on the value of <a name="idx-CHP-30-0929"></a>openness, a hallmark of enlightened management. Few
        companies have moved yet to tap so radically the potential of
        employees (or customers and other stakeholders) organized in these
        ways into articulate policymakers for the organization. But many
        companies are talking the talk, and eventually that behavior will be
        accepted as normal.</p>
