<h3 id="title-IDAW0P5L" class="docSection1Title">17.1. Background on the Software Productivity Project</h3>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">IN THE EARLY 1980S, I (MARIA) WAS
        LOOKING FOR A JOB AFTER FINISHING MY DOCTORATE IN</span> computer
        science at UCLA. I was full of enthusiasm for the field I was in and a
        little concerned about the kinds of jobs I would find. I wanted a
        place where I could follow my passion and make contributions. I had
        met Barry at one of the conferences where I presented some of my
        research results, and thus went to interview with him at TRW. During
        the interview, Barry described the environment around the company and
        told me about this new project he was starting whose objective was to
        revolutionize the way the company developed software.</p>
<p class="docText">Barry told me that he had conducted a <a name="idx-CHP-17-0482"></a>software productivity study [1] in the company, which
        performed an economic analysis to determine whether a significant
        level of investment into software productivity aids would be
        justified. The factors that led to the analysis were
        driven by an overall corporate focus on <a name="idx-CHP-17-0483"></a>industry and international competitiveness, but also
        included increased demand for software, limited supply of software
        engineers, rising software engineer support expectations, and reduced
        hardware costs&mdash;do they all sound familiar even today? This study led
        to the project that he wanted me to work on, the <a name="idx-CHP-17-0484"></a>Software Productivity Project (SPP) [2,3]. He told me it
        would not be easy, since we would be trying to <span class="docEmphasis">change the
        culture</span>. Well, it seemed the perfect challenge for my first
        job in industry, so I accepted the offer and went to work on the
        project, together with a fantastic team of <a name="idx-CHP-17-0485"></a>TRW veterans and newbies. We were going to attempt to
        change the current ways of developing software by providing a software
        development support environment for the aerospace part of the
        company.</p>
<p class="docText">Before it was acquired by Northrop Grumman, TRW was a
        conglomerate which included a large auto parts company (Thompson
        Products in Cleveland) and a large aerospace company (Ramo-Wooldridge
        in Los Angeles). It included a number of software-intensive product
        lines, including TRW Credit Data, and divisions producing
        point-of-sale systems, telecom switches, and industrial process
        control systems. In the mid-1980s, TRW was ranked number two in world
        software sales in the annual Datamation 100 lists, well behind
        IBM.</p>
<p class="docText">In the 1960s, TRW's aerospace sector pioneered in going from the
        code-and-fix approach to software development to the <a name="idx-CHP-17-0486"></a>requirements-driven waterfall model, as described in
        Winston Royce's classic 1970 paper [4]. In the 1970s, TRW developed a
        set of waterfall-oriented software development policies, standards,
        review procedures, training courses, and requirements-driven software
        tools. These were a good match to TRW's engineering, science, and
        real-time control systems of the time, and the culture became strongly
        waterfall-oriented. By the late 1970s, though, TRW's applications
        became much more people-interactive, and the <a name="idx-CHP-17-0487"></a>waterfall model didn't work well with requirements that
        were emerging as the project progressed.</p>
<p class="docText">At that time, the environment for projects included managers
        coordinating the people and activities, secretaries who typed the
        project's documents, meetings to plan and produce the project's
        activities and tasks, and system engineers and developers producing
        the designs and the systems. Only developers used software development
        tools and they had to work in batch processing mode or go to special
        bays with limited numbers of terminals for interactive development,
        using mainframe computers. Well, in the SPP we developed a new work
        environment where all members of the project (managers, system
        engineers, software developers, secretaries, and controllers) had
        individual offices with workstations, and communicated electronically
        via a local area network (LAN). Its architecture was based on the Unix
        operating system and it included commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and
        locally developed tools in support of the full life cycle (e.g.,
        requirements definition, traceability, design and development, forms
        management, and office automation tools). For this new project, we had
        to cope with significant technical and stakeholder-conflict risks, and
        with emergent requirements that could not be specified in advance;
        thus, we had a great opportunity to apply an early version of the
        <a name="idx-CHP-17-0488"></a>risk-driven, concurrently engineered spiral model
        developed by Barry [5]. Those changes created culture-clash
        challenges, especially for the waterfall-oriented
        veterans and interactive-oriented newbies on the SPP itself. We can
        still recall heated meetings where TRW veterans would say things like,
        "But the policies don't allow you to prototype this early! Prototyping
        is coding before you have passed your critical design review!"</p>
<p class="docText">The project was very successful (with significant productivity
        gains&mdash;a factor of two or more, depending on reuse), but it was not
        easy to institutionalize the changes and convince the personnel. We
        also learned that productivity gains require an integrated program of
        initiatives in several areas and an ongoing and sustained effort. Even
        though this project happened long ago, the stories we tell in this
        chapter describe points that are still valid today, in spite of all
        the advancement in tools and technologies, both in planning and in
        executing productivity activities. <span class="docEmphasis">Changing cultures is
        difficult, and it is even harder to keep up with the fast pace of
        technology in large organizations</span>.</p>
