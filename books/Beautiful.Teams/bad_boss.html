<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew Stellman</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">IT WAS THE MID-1990S. FLANNEL WAS IN
      STYLE, THE THEME FROM FRIENDS WAS A BILLBOARD HIT</span>, and I was
      working as a programmer at a small suit-and-tie financial company on
      Wall Street. I joined as a junior programmer, and by this time I'd
      worked my way up to senior developer. I'd gained a reputation for being
      able to get big jobs done quickly. I also had a reputation for speaking
      my mind, even when it wasn't always the most tactful time to be running
      my mouth. My <a name="idx-CHP-24-0760"></a>boss, Peter, once referred to me as a "loose cannon that
      he learned to point in the right direction." I had no problem with
      that.</p>
<p class="docText">The dot-com boom hadn't quite hit New York yet, and the company
      where I worked was somewhat traditional and a little stuffy. It was the
      sort of company where the title "manager" carried a lot of baggage. Only
      capital-M Managers got offices, and when someone was promoted to Manager
      it was a big deal. There was a lot of competition for one of those
      prized Manager slots. The company had a culture where people went out of
      their way to be more than a little obsequious to the boss, and there was
      a bit of a cult of personality around the CEO. I'd heard of someone who
      had been fired after his first day for referring to the CEO as "the old
      man" to a coworker, who promptly reported the gaffe to her boss.</p>
<p class="docText">I didn't mind. Despite the suits and ties and
      stuffiness, I felt that I'd really carved out a nice niche for myself. I
      got to work with a lot of new technology, and I was getting a lot of
      work done. Peter trusted me to do my job, and gave me bigger and more
      critical assignments over time. I definitely felt like I made a
      difference to the company&mdash;the software I built had a big impact on the
      bottom line. And I was working with a team that I really liked. Everyone
      got along really well, and I don't remember any major arguments or
      fights among any of us&mdash;at least, not up to this point.</p>
<p class="docText">The company was a value-added data reseller: we provided financial
      data to investment banks. Most of the software I worked on had to do
      with reading data we got from several of our dozens of data vendors,
      performing arcane and complex financial calculations, scrubbing the data
      (usually by comparing it against multiple sources), and sending it off
      to our clients, who used a custom frontend program to access it. Our
      little team was only a small part of the company; most of the employees
      either entered financial data into programs that we built, or worked on
      the sales team talking to clients.</p>
<p class="docText">Aside from me, there were five other people on the team. There
      were three other programmers: Paul, who had an advanced degree in
      mathematics and spent his time writing financial algorithms and
      low-level code; Diane, a really talented GUI designer and a good
      all-around coder; and Lenny, who'd been with the company for years in
      the data entry group, and had worked his way onto our team after
      spending a few years writing scripts for the other data entry people.
      And there were two testers, too. Ellen was an amazing QA engineer: there
      were many times that I turned my "finished" code over to her thinking it
      was done, only to get a heaping pile of bugs back from her that needed
      to be fixed. Anne was the newest team member, a junior tester that Ellen
      had taken under her wing.</p>
<p class="docText">We all reported to Peter. He'd been at the company since it
      started. He was a jack-of-all-trades who had wired up the company's
      first network, negotiated with data providers, configured network
      servers, Unix boxes, firewalls, and routers, and, because one of our
      data providers needed it to feed us stock quotes, he even spent an
      afternoon in the rain strapping a microwave radio receiver to a post on
      the roof of the office building we were in on the corner of Wall Street
      and Broadway. I had a lot of respect for him. He worked longer hours
      than anyone else in the company, and he was always willing to get his
      hands dirty. And even better, he never made me call him "Sir."</p>
<p class="docText">We'd been working on a big project for the past three months. It
      was an important project for the company: it had to do with reading our
      clients' stock portfolios, calculating their returns, and comparing them
      with a bunch of stock indexes. The sales team was anxious to have it
      complete, because it was going to be a major service that they'd sell to
      our customers. And the data team wanted it done, too, because it would
      automate a bunch of the most tedious work that they did. I was the
      project lead, and had spent weeks talking to the salespeople, data entry
      group, and senior managers before coming up with the spec, architecture,
      and database design. Diane had designed the user interface, and now Paul
      and I were busy building the code. Ellen and Anne were busy building a
      test plan and test cases, and putting together a pretty extensive set of
      test databases for us all to use while we were building and testing the
      code.</p>
<p class="docText">Our big project was going pretty well, but
      things weren't perfect. We'd broken the project into three major phases
      where we delivered fully functional pieces of the final product, and we
      were about to deliver the first phase. (Later on in my career, I'd learn
      about iteration. But this was the mid-1990s, and the best we had at the
      time was <a name="idx-CHP-24-0761"></a>phased releases.) We were just about done with the first
      phase. There was a piece of the program that the data people would use
      immediately while we finished the last two phases. And there was one
      small portion of it that the salespeople were planning to show to
      clients to prime the pump for future sales.</p>
<p class="docText">It was time to demo our work, so I gathered my five teammates into
      a conference room, and asked Peter to call in Agnes, the VP of the data
      entry group; the head of sales (who brought his top two salespeople,
      because they happened to be in the office that day); and the CEO. I
      proudly demonstrated the software we built, showing them the ins and the
      outs of it. We were all excited to see the looks on their faces when
      they saw the software we built. Excited, that is, until we actually
      <span class="docEmphasis">saw</span> the looks on their faces.</p>
<p class="docText">After I was done, there was a long silence. Finally, Agnes said,
      "Well, that looks great. We'll definitely be able to use it." She didn't
      sound convinced.</p>
<p class="docText">"But&#8230;?" I asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"But, well, wasn't it supposed to read the client portfolios from
      the network?" she asked.</p>
<p class="docText">Ugh. I had no idea it was supposed to read client portfolios from
      the network. Somehow, in all my discussions with them, I'd missed that
      point. This was a disaster, and it was entirely my fault. Nobody on the
      team was making eye contact with me.</p>
<p class="docText">The meeting ended at a quarter to four. I took the team out to
      coffee, my treat, for the rest of the afternoon. We needed a plan. We
      argued. We went through denial, anger, bargaining, and acceptance. We
      came up with a plan. We'd bring everyone together for a meeting to
      really hash out exactly what needed to be built. We'd work with them
      together. We'd work with them individually. We'd write everything down,
      and we'd walk through it all with everyone. We'd fix the software. We'd
      get the rest of it right.</p>
<p class="docText">And that's pretty much what happened. We were lucky&mdash;the data and
      salespeople had a pretty good idea of what they wanted. They really
      wanted the software done right, and they were willing to sit down with
      me for days to work through their problems. I took a step back and
      really tried to figure out what they wanted. I asked a lot of
      questions.</p>
<p class="docText">And I learned from my mistake. I didn't go it alone. No, I got the
      team involved&mdash;any time there was a question about how the users would
      work with the software, Diane was there to help us figure out the GUI.
      Lenny knew the data vendors and their formats really well, and sometimes
      I needed a translator (since I spoke programmer, and the data people
      spoke data). And Paul really had a knack for the calculations we needed
      to do. Ellen and Anne insisted on sitting in with us through most of the
      meeting. I wasn't really sure what they were doing, but they took a lot
      of notes and grabbed samples of pretty much every data file we had to
      work with. (Eventually they came back to us with a complete test
      database that made our development job much easier, along with a really
      thorough set of test cases.)</p>
<p class="docText">Two weeks later, it seemed like we were past
      the problem. The people from data and sales were great&mdash;they sat through
      at least three different walkthroughs, which must have been enormously
      tedious for them. But I really got the feeling that we were on the right
      track.</p>
<p class="docText">And, more importantly, we were rolling along again with the
      project. And all six of us on the team were getting along really well
      again. I must have pulled all five of my teammates aside at one time or
      another to make sure they weren't mad at me. "Absolutely not," said
      Anne, when I talked to her. In fact, I got the sense, after talking to
      each of them, that we were actually somehow closer-knit. It was trial by
      fire, and we'd survived it.</p>
<p class="docText">The only problem was that Peter was becoming a bottleneck for us,
      and he knew it. We had to pull him into a lot of meetings. There were a
      lot of decisions that he had to be a part of, especially when it
      involved pulling people off other work to help plan the project. At one
      point, he pulled me aside.</p>
<p class="docText">"Look," he said. "I just added four new tech-support guys, and
      they need a lot of my time."</p>
<p class="docText">We spent some time talking about what the team needed. He felt
      that a lot of his job had amounted to being a "negotiator" between us
      and the other managers. It turned out that he spent a lot of his time
      "running interference"&mdash;protecting us from an almost constant barrage of
      requests for changes, alterations, and new projects that probably
      weren't needed. But just as the programming part of his job was getting
      more and more demanding, so was the IT side. The company was growing,
      and he'd gotten approval to build a new data center to house our
      increasingly large network infrastructure.</p>
<p class="docText">So it came down to this: Peter said that we needed a full-time
      manager. We needed to split IT and development into two teams. He'd work
      with the IT folks directly, and he needed to put someone in charge of
      the development team.</p>
<p class="docText">He asked me whether I wanted the job.</p>
<p class="docText">I'd never really thought about management, except that I knew I
      wasn't really all that interested. "Look, I'm flattered you asked me.
      But I just don't think I've got the experience to do it."</p>
<p class="docText">I could see that he was disappointed. But he didn't push
      me.</p>
<p class="docText">"I'll start looking for a new manager," he said.</p>
<p class="docText">Over the next month and a half, Peter interviewed at least a dozen
      people. He rejected most of them. Apparently, it's hard to find a good
      manager. Then one day he called me into his office.</p>
<p class="docText">Peter said, "Meet Eric."</p>
<p class="docText">There's a big guy sitting in front of me. He's easily six foot
      four, mostly bald, wearing a three-piece pinstripe suit and what looked
      like a very expensive watch. His tie clip and cufflinks matched. He
      definitely looked like he'd fit in with the company's culture, probably
      better than I did. He was coming to us from one of the large investment
      banks&mdash;he was a vice president at our biggest
      client, as it turned out. He'd worked with large development teams
      before, and said that he'd have no trouble with our small team. It
      looked like Peter had found his manager!</p>
<p class="docText">We were all pretty excited. The first person I ran into after
      meeting Eric was Diane, and she was really happy about it. It turns out
      that Peter had had Eric talk to her. Eric had told her that he thought
      she'd done great work, and was thinking about giving her a bigger role
      on the team (which she wanted). I talked to Paul, who told me that Eric
      had dropped a few hints that he'd give Paul a big raise at his next
      review. All in all, we were all pretty excited to get someone on board
      who might help us keep from repeating the problem that cost us weeks on
      our big project.</p>
<p class="docText">Two weeks later, Eric came on board. They gave him Peter's
      office&mdash;Peter moved to a bigger one that was closer to the IT people.
      Eric brought in golf trophies and a few awards from his old job at the
      investment bank. He had a photo of a big boat&mdash;presumably his&mdash;on his desk
      in a wooden picture frame with a fancy nautical clock inlaid into it. It
      looked like a capital-M Manager's office.</p>
<p class="docText">Eric brought all six of us into a conference room for a big team
      meeting.</p>
<p class="docText">"I really respect good developers," Eric said. "And you're a
      really good group of developers. I respect that."</p>
<p class="docText">So far, so good. He told us that he wanted to "get out of the way
      and let you do your job." OK. He talked a little bit about sailing, and
      how a good captain steers the ship and everyone on the crew did their
      jobs. He talked about habits of highly effective people. He talked about
      trust, and wanting to earn our trust.</p>
<p class="docText">Then he talked about an executive training retreat at his old
      investment bank, where they had the VPs go out into the woods with a
      former Navy SEAL. OK. I didn't quite see where he was going with this. I
      was never a fan of the sort of "trust falls and group hugs" mandatory
      corporate retreat, and Eric seemed to really like them. But I was still
      willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. I looked around the room
      to see how the rest of the team was taking it all. Diane and Paul looked
      like they were buying it. Ellen and Anne, less so.</p>
<p class="docText">Eric closed out the meeting by telling us that things would be
      changing. "I'm not like Peter," he said. "I'll show you respect, and
      fight for you." That was a little weird. I never really got the
      impression that Peter had anything but respect for us, and I wasn't
      really aware that he hadn't fought for us in the past (or that he'd
      needed to). Lenny looked a little uncomfortable. Paul, who usually had a
      good poker face, was frowning.</p>
<p class="docText">I pulled Ellen aside after the meeting. Ellen and I had a really
      good working relationship. We'd spent a lot of time talking about
      software development over the last couple of years, trying to figure out
      how to make things better. A lot of the meetings that I had with the
      data and sales people to fix the big project were actually her idea, and
      they worked really well. What's more, Ellen was generally an excellent
      judge of character, so I wanted to know what she thought.</p>
<p class="docText">"Honestly, I could be happier right now," she
      said. "Did you notice that he never actually spoke to me or Anne? He
      only talked about programming. I think he might have a problem with
      us."</p>
<p class="docText">I completely dismissed her. (I've since learned that it's
      generally a mistake to dismiss things that Ellen says.) I told her,
      "Look, I'm confident that he's a good manager. We just need to give him
      a chance." For some reason, I'm often optimistic like that about people,
      especially about people I report to. This wouldn't be the last time that
      kind of optimism would come back to bite me in the ass.</p>
<p class="docText">Later that week, Eric asked me to come to his office. He sat me
      down and grinned. He had an unnerving grin.</p>
<p class="docText">"I've been talking to the people at the top of the company. They
      need two things, and they're both top priority. The first priority is an
      intranet."</p>
<p class="docText">"Um, Eric, I'm not quite 100% clear on what you mean by that." We
      already had an internal network, behind the firewall that connected us
      to the rest of the Internet. (It was the mid-1990s, so we just had a 56k
      line.) We had a few web servers running some internal applications on an
      early version of IIS, and we had some shared file servers. What more did
      we need?</p>
<p class="docText">"I talked to the top managers, and they want more than that. They
      want a full-scale intranet application, a single launch point for all of
      our internal applications. It should have a deep menu system. It should
      be fully configurable. It should let you access every internal resource
      we have: every program, every file, every piece of data. It should have
      a database browser, a file viewer, and a message board. And they want
      you to build it."</p>
<p class="docText">OK.</p>
<p class="docText">"So, what's the other thing they want?" I asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"Their second priority is that we expand the team. I had to fight
      for this one, but I convinced them to add a slot for another
      developer."</p>
<p class="docText">I wasn't sure why he wanted another developer on board. We didn't
      really have a huge backlog of work. Everyone had enough work to do, but
      nobody was clamoring for extra software to be built. In fact, I was
      under the impression that we had the opposite problem: we had enough
      trouble getting the people from the business side&mdash;the salespeople and
      data people&mdash;to take time out of their schedules to meet with us. We
      already spent too much of our time waiting for them. In fact, I thought
      that was part of the reason that Peter wanted a new manager for the
      team.</p>
<p class="docText">Clearly, that's not how Eric saw it. "I went to bat for you guys,
      for the team. I made a big stink with the higher-ups, and after a fight
      I got them to add another slot for a programmer. That's how I take care
      of my team."</p>
<p class="docText">Over the next few days, I spent about five hours talking to Eric
      about the intranet. At first, he seemed to have a good idea of what the
      senior managers wanted. He spent about an hour
      talking about a "grand plan." I didn't quite follow, but I did take a
      lot of notes. He talked about menus, and options, and databases, and a
      data browser, and a bunch of other features that would probably take me
      a good three months to finish.</p>
<p class="docText">I got started with the project. But when I went back to my notes,
      I definitely got the sense that while like Eric may have had a "grand
      plan," his actual plan for the software came up short. So, I went back
      to him and asked for more details. Like the menus&mdash;what did he mean by
      "configurable"? Did he want to configure it using files or a database?
      Did he want a GUI for that, or was it enough to edit the database or
      files directly?</p>
<p class="docText">Eric's response was less than satisfactory. "You're authorized to
      make those decisions yourself," he said. Then he said he had to take a
      call. I wasn't sure what he meant by "authorized." I didn't need
      authority, I needed answers. Eric didn't have any. He didn't answer my
      emails for the next two days. So, I started building the intranet, doing
      the best I could from my notes. I kept going for a few weeks. Luckily,
      I'm pretty imaginative, and came up with my own idea of what an intranet
      would look like for our company. That whole time, I didn't get much
      direction from Eric&mdash;every time I talked to him, he didn't really seem to
      know what I was working on. But when I showed him the progress I'd made,
      he said he was really happy. Apparently, I was doing a great job and
      building exactly what he asked me to do.</p>
<p class="docText">Well, he was the <a name="idx-CHP-24-0762"></a>boss. He was happy. So I was doing my job&#8230;right?</p>
<p class="docText">A little over three weeks had gone by since Eric had come on
      board. I was working on building some obscure part of the intranet when
      Diane knocked on my cube wall.</p>
<p class="docText">"Have you met with Eric yet?" she asked.</p>
<p class="docText">It turned out that while I got my share of face time with Eric, he
      hadn't even had a single one-on-one talk with her. After she finished
      with the GUI for our big project (which she finished long before Eric
      arrived), she moved on to a new project for Agnes, the VP in charge of
      the data entry group. She and Anne had been working with Agnes since
      then, and about two weeks after Eric came on board they'd delivered the
      final product.</p>
<p class="docText">Over the past week, there were a couple of bugs that Agnes's team
      had run into, and Diane fixed them. But other than that, she'd been
      sitting around without much work to do. She'd sent a few emails to Eric
      letting him know that she was ready for the next project, but he never
      responded to any of them. She'd left him a voicemail, which he
      apparently ignored.</p>
<p class="docText">I thought that was weird. There was definitely work for her to do.
      I was preoccupied with the intranet, so I wasn't working on the big
      project. That left Paul and Lenny on it, and they could definitely use
      her help. Which was great, since she wanted to work on it. It was an
      important project, and she'd put a lot of work into the GUI design
      already. But the last time she talked to Eric was when she ran into him
      in the hallway, and he told her that she should "absolutely not get
      involved with it under any circumstances." That was two weeks earlier,
      and she hadn't heard a peep from him since then.</p>
<p class="docText">I told her, "Don't worry, I'm sure there's
      just something weird going on. He'll definitely be on board when we
      explain the situation to him."</p>
<p class="docText">I was na&iuml;ve. I sent Eric a long email explaining everything. I
      told him about all the work that Diane had been doing, talked about her
      valuable contribution to the big project already, and that she was
      ramped up and ready to go. I made it clear that I had a lot of respect
      for her, and that it made sense for her to get started on it.</p>
<p class="docText">No response. Nothing.</p>
<p class="docText">I dropped by his office and knocked on his door. He wasn't there.
      Apparently he was out to a long lunch with one of his old buddies from
      the investment bank. I asked around later, and found out that he told
      one of the salespeople that he might be able to get our company on an
      "inside track" with that bank. That wasn't really his job, but I figured
      it was good for the company, so it must be OK&#8230;right?</p>
<p class="docText">He was back in his office by a quarter to four. I started to tell
      him about Diane.</p>
<p class="docText">"Yeah, I saw your note. Don't worry about it, I'll take care of
      it."</p>
<p class="docText">Great! But, well, what exactly was he going to do?</p>
<p class="docText">"I said, don't worry about it." He seemed agitated, and eager to
      change the subject. Then Eric handed me a thick stack of paper. It
      contained nearly fifty resumes. "We need to fill that open developer
      slot," Eric said. "Here's a stack of candidates. Go through them, call
      them up, and find the best ones." I hadn't really spent much time going
      through resumes before. I thought that was <span class="docEmphasis">his</span> job.
      There was a reason I didn't take the manager position when Peter offered
      it to me.</p>
<p class="docText">"What about the intranet project?" I asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"This takes priority," he replied.</p>
<p class="docText">I decided to drop the Diane issue. I felt <a name="idx-CHP-24-0763"></a>bad about it, but it was pretty clear that I wouldn't be
      able to do anything about it. I went back to her and told her what
      happened. She took it well, but still didn't know what to do. I told her
      that she should just start working on the big project. There was a piece
      that wasn't being worked on, and I had a pretty good idea that she'd be
      able to handle it. She'd already designed the GUI for that piece, and
      had a good idea of how the internals needed to work. Yes, Eric told me
      he'd take care of it. But he didn't say what he'd do, and I had a
      feeling that he was just going to leave Diane twisting in the wind. And
      I was starting to get the sneaking suspicion that Eric might not really
      care all that much either way. So, I told Diane that she should go ahead
      and join the big project.</p>
<p class="docText">"But what about Eric?" she asked.</p>
<p class="docText">I told her to let me worry about it. "If he raises a stink, I'll
      take the blame. I'll say that I misunderstood him." I invoked one of my
      favorite rules (which, incidentally, I'd learned from Peter): sometimes
      it's better to apologize tomorrow than ask permission today. I met
      with Paul and Lenny, and we all carved out a piece
      of the big project for Diane to work on. They were happy for the help.
      Eric may not have cared about the project, but the team did. They were
      glad to have her on board.</p>
<p class="docText">After that meeting, Lenny pulled me aside. "Look, I need you to
      talk to Agnes."</p>
<p class="docText">Apparently, Agnes had been coming to Lenny at least once every day
      or two asking for him to maintain some old scripts he'd worked on. That
      was a problem. When Lenny officially left her department to move over to
      Peter's group two years back, Agnes had promised that he wouldn't have
      to maintain those old scripts. They had another person who was perfectly
      capable of doing the job, and we needed Lenny to keep moving on the big
      project. But Agnes wanted that other person to do "more important" work,
      so she kept bothering Lenny about those scripts.</p>
<p class="docText">That was one of those "running interference" jobs that Eric was
      supposedly hired to do. And when Lenny talked to him two days earlier,
      he told Lenny that he was absolutely confident that Agnes would stop. He
      told Lenny that he'd "ripped her a new one" and promised that would be
      the end of it. But just yesterday, Agnes came over yet again with
      another request for a script modification.</p>
<p class="docText">Something was definitely weird there. I'd just had a meeting with
      Agnes a few hours earlier, and she seemed her normal self: smug,
      overconfident, and generally obnoxious&mdash;the same old Agnes we'd come to
      know and love over the years. If Eric had really "ripped her a new one"
      then she would have been irritable and cranky instead. (As far as I
      could tell, Agnes had only those two moods, so she was easy to read.)
      Instead, she actually went out of her way to point out how well Eric had
      been doing recently. Things were not adding up.</p>
<p class="docText">So, I promised Lenny I'd talk to Agnes and see whether I could get
      her to stop. It wouldn't be too hard&mdash;she wanted the big project done,
      and I figured that she just didn't realize that Lenny was an important
      part of it. I figured that if I put it in that light, she'd agree to
      back off. And when I went to talk to her, that's exactly how the
      conversation went. Lenny was definitely happy to be off script
      maintenance duty, and we got our programmer back.</p>
<p class="docText">By this time, I was spending more than half of my time dealing
      with hiring a programmer for the slot that Eric fought for. My work on
      the intranet project had fallen off substantially, because I'd been
      spending a lot of my time on the phone with recruiters or conducting
      phone screens for Eric. Not only that, but I was giving assignments to
      the team, running interference with the managers, and generally doing
      all of Eric's job. That left me wondering exactly what he was
      doing.</p>
<p class="docText">After poring through dozens of resumes and talking to more than 10
      candidates, I finally found a programmer who would be perfect for the
      job. I brought her resume to Eric. She was a really good fit: she'd
      spent 15 years as a programmer at a consulting company, and before that
      she'd been an analyst at an investment bank for another 10 years. She
      already knew the language we were using, and had been building financial
      software for years.</p>
<p class="docText">He looked over her resume for a minute.
      "<span class="docEmphasis">She</span> graduated from college in 1961. That would
      make her, what, in her early 50s?" He put a lot of emphasis on the word
      <span class="docEmphasis">she</span>, in a way that made me very
      uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="docText">"I guess so," I replied. "I didn't ask her age."</p>
<p class="docText">"Humph," said Eric. He looked at the resume some more. I watched
      the minute hand of the nautical clock built into the picture frame on
      his desk jump. "I'll give her a call and tell you how it goes."</p>
<p class="docText">I went back to my desk. Fifteen minutes later, Eric calls me back
      into his office.</p>
<p class="docText">"She's not right for the company."</p>
<p class="docText">I asked him to explain himself. He declined. "It's my decision.
      I'm just not comfortable with some of her, um,
      <span class="docEmphasis">attributes</span>." I asked him to be more specific. He
      told me that he couldn't really say any more than that. "You know, it's
      because of her, well, her age and her gender. It's just not a good
      match."</p>
<p class="docText">I was floored. I know I should have told him that it was blatantly
      illegal&mdash;not to mention personally offensive to me&mdash;to reject our best
      candidate because she's a woman and she's over 50. But I just didn't
      know what to do. So, I walked out of his office, called up the
      candidate's recruiter to say that we had to pass on her, and went home
      early for the day.</p>
<p class="docText">The next day, Eric told me to clear my schedule after lunch. He'd
      done a phone screen with one of my second-choice candidates, and now he
      was coming in for a face-to-face interview. I thought that was odd,
      since I didn't give Eric any second-choice candidates. He handed me the
      resume. I didn't remember seeing it before. The guy didn't have all that
      much experience, but I didn't see any red flags.</p>
<p class="docText">The interview was scheduled for 1:00 p.m. At a quarter after, I
      got a call from the receptionist. She sounded a little giddy, and said
      something about Elvis arriving for his interview. She was always
      giggling and cracking jokes. I walked to the front of the office, and
      sure enough, Elvis was standing there. He wasn't quite the young
      Elvis&mdash;he was definitely a little pudgy&mdash;but he wasn't quite the old, fat
      Elvis, either. He had hair slicked into a mini pompadour, long sideburns
      (remember, it was the mid-'90s, and thanks to Luke Perry on
      <span class="docEmphasis">Beverly Hills 90210</span>, sideburns were back in style),
      and sunglasses.</p>
<p class="docText">I brought Elvis back to an empty conference room and did the
      interview. He'd exaggerated a bit on his resume, but for the most part
      he seemed to have a reasonable idea of what he was doing. He'd done some
      programming before, mostly with databases. He'd probably be able to
      maintain some of the scripts that Lenny had written a while back, so
      there would definitely be work for him. When he was done, I dropped an
      email to Eric recommending him for a junior position.</p>
<p class="docText">The next day, there was an email from Eric to the rest of the team
      announcing that we'd just hired a new senior programmer. He was pleased
      to let us know that this senior programmer would
      take over a major part of the big project that Paul, Lenny, Diane,
      Ellen, and Anne were working steadily on. That new senior
      programmer<span class="docEmphasis">&#8230;Elvis?!</span></p>
<p class="docText">No, no, that had to be a mistake. He wasn't senior, not by a long
      shot. And there was absolutely no way that Elvis could handle that job.
      He could maintain some simple scripts, maybe do a little minor database
      work. But he had neither the skills nor the knowledge required to take
      on any part of the big project. I tried to find Eric, but he was out at
      a long lunch again. By the time he got back to the office, the day was
      almost over. I told him that I thought Elvis would crash and burn. Eric
      told me to have some faith. My faith was definitely starting to run
      thin.</p>
<p class="docText">Two weeks later, Elvis showed up in the cube across from me. He
      arrived late, the last one on the team to show up. He was still wearing
      those sunglasses. He made small talk with the receptionist. (She told me
      later that he'd hit on her when he showed up for the interview.) We had
      a team meeting that afternoon about the big project. Paul and Lenny had
      come up with a plan to try to bring Elvis up to speed. Elvis never
      showed up.</p>
<p class="docText">The next day he told Paul that he'd had a personal emergency and
      had to leave early. Paul was irritated&mdash;he'd spent all morning putting
      together material for that meeting instead of coding. They were starting
      to fall behind on the big project and needed all the time they could
      get.</p>
<p class="docText">Two days later, Elvis didn't show up for work at all. He didn't
      show up the day after. Eric didn't say anything. He seemed to be acting
      like nothing happened. Later that day, I ran into the receptionist in
      the elevator, who told me what happened.</p>
<p class="docText">"Elvis failed his drug test, so we had to let him go," she
      said.</p>
<p class="docText">The company had a policy that required all new employees to take a
      drug test. Every candidate is told about it in the first phone
      interview. Elvis knew about the test, and had over two weeks to get
      clean.</p>
<p class="docText">"Wait a minute," I said. "I know that one of the IT guys tested
      positive for pot, and they let him slide."</p>
<p class="docText">"Yeah, but Elvis tested positive for coke. According to the test,
      he did it in the past two days," she said. "Elvis has left the
      building."</p>
<p class="docText">I can't say that I was sad to see him go. I didn't tell anyone
      about what happened, but later that day I heard it from at least three
      other team members. Apparently everyone knew about Elvis and his drug
      problem.</p>
<p class="docText">Eric took it all in stride. He handed me another stack of resumes,
      and asked me to call at least 10 of the people in the pile. This was
      getting ridiculous. I hadn't had time to work on the intranet project in
      over a week, and again, Eric didn't really seem to care. So, I decided
      to talk to Peter. I don't normally like going over my <a name="idx-CHP-24-0764"></a>boss's head, but I'd been working with Peter for a long
      time. I felt comfortable talking to him, and I wanted to get the
      straight scoop.</p>
<p class="docText">"What intranet project?" he asked.</p>
<p class="docText">That's when I discovered that nobody else in the company even knew
      I was working on the intranet project. I couldn't believe it&mdash;Eric told
      me that it was a critical project that the senior managers specifically
      asked for. Peter was in all of the strategy meetings where the senior
      managers discussed the new projects, and it had never been brought up.
      In fact, Eric was never even <span class="docEmphasis">in</span> any of those
      meetings, so there's no way that he'd have any idea what the senior
      managers were asking for. Apparently, Eric had decided all by himself
      that it was a priority, and I'd spent months of my life working on a
      project that nobody else at the company needed or wanted.</p>
<p class="docText">I went back to Eric, who seemed genuinely irritated that I wasn't
      on the phone with candidates to replace Elvis. He didn't really want to
      hear about the intranet project. He wasn't interested in the progress,
      and to be honest, it seemed like he'd forgotten about it entirely. I
      told him that I could really help Lenny, Diane, and Paul on the big
      project.</p>
<p class="docText">"Look, don't worry. You're doing a great job," he said. "Leave the
      big project to the rest of the team. You've got more important things to
      work on."</p>
<p class="docText">I wanted to ask him whether "more important things" meant not
      working on the intranet project or actively discriminating against
      people on the basis of their age and gender. To this day, I wish I'd had
      the <span class="docEmphasis">cojones</span> to do it.</p>
<p class="docText">I was back at my desk stewing about my missed opportunity to run
      my mouth, when I heard Eric shouting at the top of his lungs. I peeked
      into his office&mdash;his door was open&mdash;and was pretty shocked to see that he
      was yelling at Ellen and Anne. From what I could hear, apparently there
      was some sort of emergency with a client's data.</p>
<p class="docText">After the onslaught ended, Ellen and Anne left. Anne was sobbing
      quietly at her desk. Ellen looked like she wanted to kick someone's head
      in. It turned out that there was a problem with a piece of data that one
      of the bigger clients used. That client threatened to cancel the
      account. The thing is, both Ellen and Anne knew perfectly well that the
      problem had nothing to do with them. And not because they're testers&mdash;it
      wasn't even that they'd missed any sort of bug. The problem had
      originated at one of the data vendors that provided the data that we
      sent on to clients. There was absolutely nothing that we could have done
      about this. If anyone was at fault, it was Agnes and her data entry
      group for missing the data problem. But Agnes was particularly good at
      avoiding blame, so she came down on Eric. And Eric, in search of a
      scapegoat, apparently decided to let Ellen and Anne have it.</p>
<p class="docText">Ellen and I took Anne out for coffee. She was beside herself. The
      entire office heard Eric yell at her, thanks to the fact that he'd left
      his door open (apparently on purpose, specifically to embarrass them).
      We got her calmed down, but she didn't get any work done for the rest of
      the day. She ended up taking the following Friday and Monday off to
      visit her mother. She still looked upset when she came back on Tuesday,
      but at least she was able to get back to work. I asked her whether she
      was OK.</p>
<p class="docText">"Yes, Andrew," she said. "I'm OK, mostly. I
      want to see the big project through. I've put a lot of work into it. But
      when we're done, will you be a reference for me when I'm interviewing
      for a new job?"</p>
<p class="docText">I told her I'd be a reference. I was just glad that she'd be there
      for the rest of the project.</p>
<p class="docText">And she was making progress on it. The whole team was. As
      surprising as it was, everyone on the team seemed truly committed to
      delivering the big project. I only wished that I could be a part of it,
      rather than being stuck with doing Eric's job for him. By now, I was the
      only person who wasn't actively working on it. The rest of the team had
      gotten through the second of the three phases, and this time, both the
      data entry people and the salespeople loved what they saw. Agnes even
      sent them a congratulatory email, which was uncharacteristically kind of
      her. They were extremely happy&mdash;so happy that they were only slightly
      miffed at Eric's obnoxious reply (cc:'d to everyone in the company)
      taking credit for the success.</p>
<p class="docText">The company was expanding. When I first arrived, we took up only
      about half of the seventh floor of the building. Now we took up the
      entire seventh floor, and had recently signed a lease for half of the
      eighth floor. This was lucky for the team. They started using a
      conference room up there, which caused Eric&mdash;who routinely complained
      about having to go up a flight of stairs whenever there was a meeting up
      there&mdash;to stop dropping by their team meetings unannounced and giving
      long speeches about his time as a vice president at his old investment
      bank.</p>
<p class="docText">Later, Paul pulled me aside. He told me that his cousin worked at
      the same investment bank where Eric had worked. He said that his cousin
      was also a vice president, and told him that they handed out vice
      president titles like they were party favors. The idea, apparently, is
      that when a small Midwestern customer calls up demanding to talk to
      someone, they can always be connected with "Vice President So-and-So,"
      who personally handles their account. This is an effective sales tool,
      because it makes a small customer feel like he's being treated like a
      big shot.</p>
<p class="docText">That explained a lot. Eric no longer seemed particularly
      impressive. According to Paul's cousin, the fact that he was a vice
      president from that investment bank simply meant that he wasn't a
      janitor.</p>
<p class="docText">(To be honest, I was starting to suspect that the janitor who
      cleaned our office would do a better job than Eric. I'd talk to him
      occasionally when I stayed late working on a project. Despite his prison
      tattoos, he was a nice guy. His name was Mike. Unfortunately, the
      building eventually switched to a non-union janitorial company, and he
      left. The service workers' union went on strike against the building,
      and I felt weird about crossing their picket line outside and started
      using the rear entrance.)</p>
<p class="docText">It was about this time that Ellen had her annual review. She
      wasn't really sure what to expect, since the only interaction she'd
      really had with Eric by this point was being yelled at. Still, she's
      always very professional about these things, and she'd been promised a
      raise at her last meeting with Peter. Unfortunately, as soon as she sat
      down for her review, she saw something she wasn't
      supposed to see. Eric had written up my performance review already, and
      had left it face-up on his desk&mdash;and at the bottom, in big bold numbers,
      was my salary.</p>
<p class="docText">It was approximately twice as much as hers.</p>
<p class="docText">Ellen had been at the company about as long as I had. She had more
      experience than I did, with more years in the software industry. Yes,
      testers tended to make a little less than programmers. But she had
      really made a difference to the company, and it was outrageous that I
      was earning twice the money she was earning. This was clearly
      unacceptable. Ellen wasn't sure what to do, so she picked up the review,
      turned it over, and handed it to Eric.</p>
<p class="docText">Later, she pulled Eric aside.</p>
<p class="docText">"Look," she said. "I didn't go looking to find out what Andrew
      made. But now I know. We both know it's not right that he makes twice as
      much as I do, and I hope you can do the right thing here." She let him
      know that she didn't need to be making exactly the same as I was, but
      that she should at least be in the same order of magnitude.</p>
<p class="docText">Later that day, Eric came back to her with <a name="idx-CHP-24-0765"></a>bad news. He wasn't going to bring it up with anyone in
      senior management. And Eric pointed out that we've all seen the
      statistic about how women don't make as much as men, so she should be
      used to it.</p>
<p class="docText">A week later, Ellen gave notice and left the company.</p>
<p class="docText">Eric couldn't have been happier. Now he had two openings in his
      group: the one that he told me that he'd fought for, and now another one
      to replace Ellen. He handed me yet another stack of resumes to go
      through.</p>
<p class="docText">I went through them. I noticed that there were no testers or QA
      engineers anywhere in the stack, just programmers. I asked Eric about
      it.</p>
<p class="docText">"Aren't we going to replace Ellen? Otherwise, Anne's really going
      to have her hands full with the big project."</p>
<p class="docText">Eric wouldn't hear any of it. He told me that he had no use for
      testers, and that one programmer is worth five testers. He said that he
      felt that the industry didn't really need testers at all, and that we
      should all just hire interns and even smart teenagers to do
      testing.</p>
<p class="docText">I told him that I thought that he might be a little hasty in
      dismissing the entire field of quality assurance. He told me to get back
      to my job. Then for some reason he went off on a long tangent about how
      he was personally related to a branch of the Kennedy family, that his
      relatives have a huge amount of money and own the building on the corner
      of Broadway and Astor Place, and that he doesn't even need to work. (I
      stopped myself from asking him why he kept showing up at work,
      then.)</p>
<p class="docText">So I sucked it up, went back to my desk, and started through yet
      another stack of resumes to see whether I could find anyone to fill the
      two slots. I spent the next day and a half doing
      phone interviews and talking to recruiters. Eventually, I found three
      candidates who seemed to know what they were talking about. I thought
      they all had a lot of potential. And, just as importantly, I felt that
      their personalities would be a really good match for the rest of the
      team.</p>
<p class="docText">I was dismayed to find that of those three people, absolutely none
      of them ended up in our office. Instead, Eric hired Noam and Dustin
      within days of each other, and without letting me or anyone else on the
      team interview them.</p>
<p class="docText">Noam seemed to be a competent programmer. Eric was very excited
      about him, because they spent over two hours in the interview and Noam
      seemed, in Eric's words, "to have a lot of respect for authority." The
      problem was that while Noam was a good programmer, he was the most
      argumentative person I'd ever met. He picked fights with everyone:
      salespeople, data people, his teammates, me, Agnes, Peter; he even got
      into an argument with the CEO of the company in the elevator. (I'm not
      sure whether he knew exactly who he was talking to, though I'm pretty
      sure he wouldn't have cared either way.) Most of his arguments seemed to
      end up the same way: with him relating a story about how he was an
      Israeli tank commander on the front lines in Lebanon, and that he got
      shot at on a daily basis. This always seemed to end whatever argument
      he'd started.</p>
<p class="docText">The stories about Noam seemed to get weirder and weirder. A data
      person told me that one of her coworkers said he caught him sniffing the
      seat of her chair before work one morning. One of the salespeople pulled
      me aside and told me that they were so creeped out by him that they
      started calling him "Babies-in-Jars Noam" behind his back. The rumors
      were flying, and none of them were good.</p>
<p class="docText">In the meantime, Noam seemed to spend far more time arguing with
      people than programming, and wasn't actually getting any work done.
      Luckily, Paul and Lenny figured out early on that they didn't want him
      threatening the success of the big project. They were able to convince
      Agnes to let him start maintaining some of Lenny's old scripts. The rest
      of our team quickly learned to avoid Noam.</p>
<p class="docText">Unfortunately for Noam, things didn't end well. One of the
      receptionists complained to the human resources person that he'd been
      making inappropriate comments to her about her religion. Apparently, she
      was a Jehovah's Witness, and Noam got into a big argument with her about
      the New Testament.</p>
<p class="docText">Eric pulled me aside and told me that the "Nazis" above him were
      making him fire Noam. He told me that he didn't want to do it, and he
      understood how nervous that would make me and the other people on the
      team. He seemed to be under the impression that we'd assume that any of
      us could be fired at any time. He didn't understand that we were
      unanimously happy to see Noam go.</p>
<p class="docText">"Stick with me," Eric said. "If you make sure you keep your
      allegiance with me, I'll make sure I've got your back."</p>
<p class="docText">I wasn't sure exactly what he meant by that.</p>
<p class="docText">Meanwhile, Lenny, Diane, Paul, and Anne were
      finishing up the last phase of the big project, and it was coming out
      really well. And now that Eric had stopped asking me to review resumes,
      I could get back to work on it. Ellen was gone, and I knew I couldn't
      replace her as a tester. But I needed to fill in where I could, and
      there was testing that had to be done. So, I spent some of my time
      testing&mdash;luckily, she'd left behind a complete set of test cases&mdash;and the
      rest of my time programming. It was great to be back with the team. When
      we were working together, it was a little like all of the irritating
      problems that had been plaguing us were left behind in another world.
      Especially when we met in that eighth floor conference room, where Eric
      couldn't find us.</p>
<p class="docText">Eric's other new hire, Dustin, put an end to some of that
      temporary peace. Everyone else at the office wore a shirt and tie to
      work. That was the rule&mdash;a rule that apparently didn't apply to Dustin,
      who showed up in jeans, a hooded sweatshirt, and a wrinkled t-shirt. If
      that were the extent of the problem with Dustin's deportment, it might
      have been OK. But the real problem was that there were other rules that
      also apparently didn't apply to Dustin. Rules like showering at least
      once or twice a week.</p>
<p class="docText">Dustin smelled terrible. And, unfortunately, I seemed to be the
      person that everyone complained to about him. Every single team
      member&mdash;Lenny, Paul, Diane, and Anne&mdash;independently came to me to complain
      about his body odor. So did Agnes and at least two of the salespeople.
      Unfortunately, when I went to Eric to complain, he didn't seem
      particularly interested, and definitely didn't intend to talk to Dustin
      about it.</p>
<p class="docText">Eric demanded that we assign part of the big project to Dustin. We
      were in the final stretch of the project, and it was difficult to divide
      the work. Basically, the only thing we hadn't started was the online
      help, so we assigned it to Dustin. He spent the next four weeks working
      on it. But he wasn't actually doing anything useful. It turned out that
      he was trying to do some weird Win32 API trick to add a help option to
      the Windows menu (the little menu that appears when you click in the
      upper-righthand corner of a window). There was absolutely no reason to
      do this&mdash;it would have taken about three minutes to add a "Help" option
      to the program's main menu. But Dustin really wanted to add it to the
      Windows menu instead, where our users would never be in danger of
      actually finding and using it. I asked Eric about it. He said that not
      only was it fine, but the CEO of the company had, in fact, personally
      asked Eric for that feature.</p>
<p class="docText">Dustin never finished his project. He finally quit to join one of
      those newfangled, up-and-coming dot-coms. After he left, I looked
      through his work. There was absolutely nothing of value there. We threw
      out every line of code that he wrote.</p>
<p class="docText">I was more than a little skeptical that the CEO really asked for
      the weird help system, so I decided to ask Peter about it. Did the CEO
      really request that feature personally? Peter had no idea what I was
      talking about. That was when we were both sure that something was
      seriously wrong. Eric had been less than honest with us for a long
      time.</p>
<p class="docText">But we didn't really have time to talk that over, because Paul,
      Diane, Lenny, Anne, and I finally finished the big project. Once again,
      I called a meeting with Peter, Agnes, data entry
      group members, and salespeople. And this time, it went really well.
      There were no awkward "but isn't it also supposed to do
      <span class="docEmphasis">this</span>?" moments. Everyone&mdash;Agnes, the data entry
      people, the sales people, Peter and the rest of the team&mdash;seemed
      genuinely happy with the way the project turned out.</p>
<p class="docText">Everyone except Eric. After the meeting, he pulled me aside and
      asked what I thought about Diane and Anne. Did they really contribute to
      the project, or did Paul and I do all the work? I told him I thought
      they were indispensable.</p>
<p class="docText">"I talked to Peter," he said. "He thinks the entire team should be
      outsourced. Don't get me wrong&mdash;I think you're great. But Peter is trying
      to convince his boss and the CEO that there are serious problems with
      the team. I hate to be the one to say this to you, but he thinks you
      should all be fired."</p>
<p class="docText">I was floored. I'd never heard anything like that from Peter. I
      couldn't believe I was going to be fired. Eric told me not to worry. He
      said that he knew he had my "allegiance," and that he had my back. He
      still knew people at his old investment bank who would hire our whole
      department at any time.</p>
<p class="docText">That was the last straw. I always had a good working relationship
      with Peter, so I went to him. I told him I couldn't believe that he
      wanted to fire us and outsource the whole team. I started to make my
      case.</p>
<p class="docText">"Andrew, I have no idea what you're talking about."</p>
<p class="docText">It turned out that Peter had just talked to Eric, who told Peter
      that he had thought Diane and Anne were doing a good job. But then he
      told Peter that after seeing their work on the project, it was
      <span class="docEmphasis">me</span> who decided that they needed to be fired. And
      who was Eric to second-guess his top team member?</p>
<p class="docText">It turned out that Eric was lying to everyone. He lied to me, he
      lied to Peter, and he probably lied to pretty much everyone else he
      talked to. And as if the lying wasn't <a name="idx-CHP-24-0766"></a>bad enough, he'd racked up a steady stream of failures
      from day one: the intranet project, Elvis and his drug test, Ellen and
      her salary, the disasters that were Noam and Dustin. Even worse, that
      position that he said he'd fought for, back when he was first hired?
      There was no fighting. It turned out that when Peter brought Eric on
      board, he'd worked with the senior managers to add an extra programmer
      to the team. Eric knew that all along, and lied about it to my face for
      months.</p>
<p class="docText">The next day, Eric was fired.</p>
<p class="docText">Later that week, I was feeling really guilty about how the team
      was treated. Ellen was gone, and I was worried that Anne, Paul, Diane,
      and Lenny were in really bad shape, moralewise. I was worried that they
      resented me for not doing more about Eric, and I wouldn't have blamed
      them all for putting in notice. I'd been avoiding them all week, because
      I figured they all thought I let them down. I got a call from Peter, who
      asked me to come to his office.</p>
<p class="docText">"I talked to the rest of the team," he said.
      "We need a new manager to replace Eric, and every single person said
      that you should take over. The manager job is yours if you want
      it."</p>
<p class="docText">This time I said yes.</p>
