<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">an Interview with Steve McConnell</span></p>
<a name="steve_mcconnell_has_influenced_both_of_u"></a><p><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td>
<p class="docText">Steve McConnell has influenced both of us for as long as we've
        been working in software. He was one of the first people either of us
        read who was able to write about complex software engineering and
        quality topics in an easy-to-read, conversational tone. More than
        anyone else, Steve has been a huge influence on our own writing, both
        in our topics and in the way we choose to express ourselves. In some
        ways, it's Steve who showed us that it's possible to write a serious
        book that sounds like you're just talking to someone casually.</p>
<p class="docText">Scott Berkun was our other great influence, since if it weren't
        for him we wouldn't be writing for O'Reilly today. Scott invited
        Andrew to be a technical reviewer for his first (and excellent) book,
        <span class="docEmphasis">Making Things Happen</span>, which is where our
        relationship with O'Reilly started. (He was an enormously valuable
        reviewer for our own <span class="docEmphasis">Applied Software Project
        Management</span>.) So, when Scott offered to interview Steve for
        <span class="docEmphasis">Beautiful Teams</span>, we jumped at the chance to have
        these two people whose work we admire sit down and talk about
        teams.</p>
</td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-16-0431"></a><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: So, the first thing I want to ask you is
      does the phrase "a beautiful team" mean anything to you? Is that a
      phrase you ever used or heard used before, and in relation to software
      products you've worked on or teams you've been on or
      managed?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: I tend to be pretty
      literal, and so the idea of a beautiful team doesn't resonate all that
      well with me. When I hear "beautiful team" I assume people are talking
      about something different, and maybe they're talking about a
      high-performance team or a high-<a name="idx-CHP-16-0432"></a>quality team or something like that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Or a team of supermodels</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>:
      <span class="docEmphasis">(Laughter.)</span> Which is going to be hard to come by in
      software. So yeah, the term itself doesn't automatically make me think
      of anything in particular. I guess it makes me think of a team that's
      highly functional, has highly cooperative, collaborative, working
      relationships where everybody on the team feels like they are part of
      something elite, where the team works on something that ends up being
      successful.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't think it's good enough for the team to just feel like it's
      doing something special. I think whatever business context they're in it
      actually has to result in something that the business or the market
      agrees is special before I really say that that was a beautiful
      team.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Whenever I think of high-performance teams,
      beautiful teams, whatever adjectives you want to use, the core question,
      the first thing I think about, is whether we're talking about the means
      or the ends. Is it something that you can observe only while the team is
      working, or is it something you can evaluate only after they're
      done?</span><a name="idx-CHP-16-0433"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Well, for some reason,
      my mind's kind of going back to the notion of quality, and in
      particular, Deming's definition of quality, which is conformance to
      requirements. And if I'm trying to put some shape to the idea of a
      beautiful team, I naturally am thinking, "Well, OK, a beautiful team
      maybe is a team that conforms to requirements."</p>
<p class="docText">And the requirements can vary an awful lot from one context to
      another for a team. Some contexts you might really need a high degree of
      innovation. Another context, you might need a really high degree of
      operational efficiency. Other contexts, you might just need an
      extraordinary level of focus.</p>
<p class="docText">In many contexts, I think one of the implied requirements that get
      short-changed is sustainability, where a team does something great one
      time but they're too burnt out to do something great the next time. And
      I think whether that's good or bad just depends on what the
      organizational requirements are.</p>
<p class="docText">There certainly are cases where the organization needs to get a
      great product out in a short amount of time, and if the team is burnt
      out, that's just the cost of succeeding at that time, but there are
      other organizations that are in more of a sustaining mode, and in those
      organizations, I think, if they're burning out teams, then they're
      really jeopardizing their long-term viability.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: What's the best software
      team that you ever worked on, and why?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: One of the best teams I
      ever worked on wasn't even really a team. It was just more <a name="idx-CHP-16-0434"></a>of a workgroup, and I say it wasn't a team because we
      weren't really all working toward any common objective. We all worked
      for the same company, but we were working on different projects for
      different clients.</p>
<p class="docText">But it was a very <a name="idx-CHP-16-0435"></a>fun working environment. What made that a fun team&mdash;I don't
      know if it was a beautiful team&mdash;was that we were all young, we were all
      in the same life circumstance. We all had similar senses of humor. None
      of us had any real significant outside attachments.</p>
<p class="docText">So, we were able to spend time together outside of work as well as
      in work. And we all had a common enemy, namely our boss, and I think
      that we felt like we were getting an awful lot done. I mean, we were
      getting a lot done, we felt, in spite of our boss, maybe not because of
      him. And was that a team? I don't know. It was a cohesive workgroup, but
      we were really aiming at the same thing.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: So, you weren't actually working on the same
      project at the same time?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: We were all doing
      different projects for different clients, but we happened to all be in
      the same room. Our work overlapped a lot. We would switch off who was
      working for which client and who was working for which project, and so
      there was a pretty high degree of collaboration across the small
      projects that we were working on. So I don't know; it's hard to have a
      conversation like this without getting all nostalgic about the good old
      days.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Nostalgia's fine. I mean, that's part of the
      story here. There are very few people who will read this book who are
      aware at the moment that they are currently on the best team that
      they'll ever work on. We always think of the best as something in the
      past, and even if the team we're on right now is the best, we won't
      fully realize it until after we've moved on</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: I agree, and that
      actually matches the experience I was just describing quite well. Much
      of the time I was in that circumstance I was longing for the group of
      people that I had hung out with in high school. It wasn't until I had
      been in that circumstance for maybe a year, where one day I woke up and
      realized, hey, you know, this is actually pretty cool, too.</p>
<p class="docText">And I'm not sure what it is about the way my mind or emotions work
      that would cause me to not pay as much attention to what I'm working on
      now as to what I was working on before, but that seemed to be the way it
      was in that case.</p>
<p class="docText">I worked on a graduate school project that was also
      interesting.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: What was the goal of the
      project?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Well, one thing that
      made it a good team was that we were quite explicit about what the
      graduate school's goal was versus what our goal was. The graduate
      school's stated goal was to deliver some software
      to a customer. Our real goal was to graduate on time.</p>
<p class="docText">And we were always very clear within our team about the
      distinction between what the school thought the goal was versus what we,
      as <a name="idx-CHP-16-0436"></a>team members, were very clear our goal was.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Interesting; the beautiful and subversive
      team</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: We actively managed our
      project to try to achieve our real goal, which was to graduate on time,
      and the thing that was nice about that team was that we started out with
      most of us not knowing most of the other people on the team at the
      beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="docText">And we went through an unusually long period of just kind of
      feeling each other out to see who was good at what, who wanted to do
      what, who was sensitive about what, and so on.</p>
<p class="docText">At the time, I was impatient about it, but once the project was
      underway, I recognized it had been very healthy. There was enough
      flexibility from each person on the team that we were all willing to
      give where we needed.</p>
<p class="docText">And so everybody worked on stuff they thought was interesting, and
      didn't get over-committed. And as a result, I think the team was quite
      resilient. I mean, we had one guy whose wife was pregnant, and they
      actually lost the baby. We had another team member who went through a
      divorce. We had a couple team members who were traveling often, and even
      with some pretty significant trauma going on, the team held together
      fine. Everybody pitched in where needed.</p>
<p class="docText">All the more remarkable, I think, was that this wasn't our main
      job.</p>
<p class="docText">We had real jobs that were demanding our attention, too. So that
      definitely stands out in my mind as a team that functioned at a very
      high level as a team. The whole was greater than the sum of the parts in
      many ways.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: This is an unfair question, because I'm going to
      ask you to give a number to something that's abstract, but I'm asking
      anyway. What percentage of teams do you think are high-performing
      teams?</span><a name="idx-CHP-16-0437"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Oh, I think true
      high-performing teams are fairly rare.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Is that 10%? 5? 1?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Based on the hundreds of
      companies we've worked with over the years, I would say it has to be
      less than 10%. I mean, some of it is by definition. When you say
      high-performance team, you are implicitly saying this is a team that
      stands out from an average-performing team. It becomes a question of how
      many teams do we see that really stand out as being markedly different
      from just the rank and file teams that we work with. And every once in a
      while we see a team that stands out in some way or other, but I'd say
      10% or less.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: OK, 10%. Do you think that
      there are unique attributes about those teams that are difficult to
      replicate, or is there some way to copy them? Let's say I run a company
      of 100 and have 10 teams within that 100. And I recognize what
      high-performing teams are and believe I have one. The question is: how
      can I help the other nine teams to be more like the high-performing
      team? Or is it impossible, since what makes a great team is tightly
      wrapped up in the unique relationships between the people
      involved?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Well, this may be
      controversial, but I don't think that there's anything mysterious about
      <a name="idx-CHP-16-0438"></a>creating a high-performance team. And I realize that can
      be interpreted as maybe an overly confident statement, but I think I
      have a basis for saying that.</p>
<p class="docText">My company has received awards the last two years for being the
      best small company in Washington to work for. And we do that because of
      having really high staff morale, which has been created through the
      kinds of <a name="idx-CHP-16-0439"></a>practices that I'm here to talk about.</p>
<p class="docText">If you have people who are selfish and they only want to do what
      they want to do, it will be very tough to establish a high-performance
      team. You may have an assemblage of individuals, but that's all you're
      going to have. So, there has to be <a name="idx-CHP-16-0440"></a>goodwill and <a name="idx-CHP-16-0441"></a>flexibility. Maybe not even a super high amount, but
      some.</p>
<p class="docText">If you have some goodwill and flexibility, then I think there's a
      kind of template that you can follow. First, the team leader needs to
      establish an <a name="idx-CHP-16-0442"></a>elevating vision or goal, and I think that this is truly a
      leadership function, not just management. It goes beyond the management
      function. An awful lot of thought should go in on the part of the team
      leaders into what is the team's goal and what is it about it that is not
      just trying to trick the team into thinking they have a goal that's
      elevating or inspiring, but to come up with one that truly is.</p>
<p class="docText">A classic example is if you're out digging ditches, that's not
      very elevating or inspiring. But if you're digging ditches to protect
      your town that's about to be attacked by an enemy, well, that's more
      inspiring, even though it's the same activity. And so the leader's job,
      really, is to try to determine or frame the <a name="idx-CHP-16-0443"></a>activity in such a way that people can understand what the
      value is.</p>
<p class="docText">So, some amount of goodwill, an inspiring, elevating vision or
      goal. The next step is lots and lots of communication in all
      directions&mdash;between the team members and the leader and between the
      leader and the team members. And I think facilitating communication
      within the team <a name="idx-CHP-16-0444"></a>in all possible directions is good, too.</p>
<p class="docText">Next, I think it's useful to establish a sense of team <a name="idx-CHP-16-0445"></a>identity, something I've seen Microsoft, in particular, do
      really, really well over the years with team members getting team
      T-shirts and going on team trips and getting team awards and so on, just
      to foster that sense of team identity. Whether it's mugs, posters,
      t-shirts, jackets, beach towels&mdash;it doesn't matter. If you do this, you
      get two benefits. One is team members feel appreciated, which is just
      good for morale, in general. Two, if you do it right, they can actually
      develop a sense of team identity, which is very positive, too.</p>
<p class="docText">And then there are <a name="idx-CHP-16-0446"></a>group activities. I mentioned fostering informal
      interaction, but I would also focus on group <a name="idx-CHP-16-0447"></a>bonding activities. I have seen teams where they joke
      about doing bonding activities, but they still
      enjoy them. And I think everybody knows what you're trying to do, but
      the fact is a lot of companies refuse to spend the minimal amount of
      money it takes to actually do these activities.</p>
<p class="docText">So, maybe to put it a different way: putting some work into trying
      to create the team is, in itself, helpful. So, those are a handful of
      things that come to mind.</p>
<p class="docText">In the book <span class="docEmphasis">Peopleware</span> (Dorset House), Tom
      DeMarco and Tim Lister explicitly say they don't know how to create a
      team, but they know how to kill one. They talk about teamicide. And I've
      seen all the same things they describe&mdash;ways to keep teams from forming,
      or if they do form, how to disband them quickly, and companies do that
      all the time. They'll take a team that works really well together, and
      then they'll disband it and lose all the benefits.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Why do you think that happens so often? I think
      you'd agree that teams are critical. That the reason why that
      exceptional work happens is because of the team structure around people
      that enables really good work to happen. One complaint I always had
      during my years at Microsoft was that the rewards structure is entirely
      individually based. And so the performance structure, the way you're
      actually given bonuses and raises and promotions, is based on your
      individual performance</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Yet there is this genuine interest in building team
      identity, which is true. There are team events, team clothing, which can
      create bonding effects. But I never worked on a team or saw a team that
      said if we make our dates, everyone gets a 2% bonus, as a team. My
      gripe, my persistent complaint there, was that the reward model never
      matched the rhetoric model</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-16-0448"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">There was always the rhetoric of teams, but then when
      it's performance review time, oh, you were the best programmer, so you
      get the stock grant or whatever. Why do you think there's always a
      disconnect between the two?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Well, there's not always
      a big disconnect. We've worked with a handful of companies that actually
      do rewards at the team level, and they don't break it down further than
      that. Whether that actually works, I think, is an open question.</p>
<p class="docText">But I've seen the same thing that you described. And you know what
      you're talking about is what Gerald Weinberg would describe as a lack of
      congruence.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Yes</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: The words say one thing,
      the actions say something else. And I think in general I agree with the
      idea that the more <a name="idx-CHP-16-0449"></a>congruent you can be in your behavior, the <a name="idx-CHP-16-0450"></a>better things will go.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Here's another idea. If these high-performing
      teams are rare, do you believe there are other things you can do to
      create them? They're not impossible, but they are uncommon. So once you
      have a high-performing team, what most software companies do, once that
      project has been completed, is disband the team. Those resources now
      need to be distributed to other projects. But the alternative model says
      the high-performing team is really the most
      valuable asset you have, suggesting you want to preserve that team, find
      a way to keep them together on whatever the new project is. And you
      sacrifice domain knowledge or optimal resourcing to protect the team.
      Have you ever seen anyone who put the team first in their management
      philosophy, as opposed to last, which is generally what I've seen? And
      aside from whether you've seen it or not, do you think it's a ridiculous
      idea?</span><a name="idx-CHP-16-0451"></a><a name="idx-CHP-16-0452"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: It's funny, because what
      I would say, contradictory to what I said a minute ago, is most
      companies value the domain expertise a lot. And one of the side effects
      of valuing the domain expertise so highly is they're reluctant to move
      people out of an area once a person has acquired experience in that
      area.</p>
<p class="docText">And so while they may reconfigure how people are working together,
      over time, once people start working in one area, we see the opposite
      problem more often. That is to say we see the problem of staff getting
      bored in an area and wanting new opportunities, and their company is
      reluctant to move them when they've made an investment in that
      particular area.</p>
<p class="docText">We see that more often than we see the problem of the company just
      scattering staff to the four corners, or to the four winds once a
      project is done, and losing all of that staff expertise. I guess part of
      what I'm thinking is that we don't necessarily see really
      high-performing teams working together all that often. I'd have to get a
      larger sample of high-performing teams before I could make any
      statements about what companies usually do with them.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: All right. It's an unfair question. However, I
      think many people would agree, who've worked on good teams, that there's
      not enough protection for those teams. There's not enough reward for
      those teams to stay together and they're disbanded too often. I'm just
      thinking, what if they went to the other extreme: bet that an intact
      team that does well is the most important asset and makes things work
      around them</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: I think DeMarco and
      Lister have talked about this. Someone proposed the idea of allowing
      intact teams to bid on work within the company. And so basically, the
      notion was the team will say, "If you leave us together, we'll commit to
      get this project done in four months." And some other team might say,
      "Well, we're committed to get it done in five months." The idea is you
      take a nominal estimate for a non-intact team, and if you can get a
      <a name="idx-CHP-16-0453"></a>better deal from a team by <a name="idx-CHP-16-0454"></a>keeping it intact, and the team says, hey, it's so
      important to us to stay together that we're willing to work extra to
      come up to speed in the area or whatnot, then that could be an
      attractive model for a company.</p>
<p class="docText">To my mind, the Achilles' heel in that argument is that the team
      can say whatever it wants, but that doesn't mean they're necessarily
      going to deliver.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: And you're also creating an environment where
      those teams are competing with each other for
      projects</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: It has the potential. So
      I mean, I'm purely going on analysis here, because I can't point to any
      examples where I've seen this actually done, but it seems like it would
      have the potential to lead to a sweatshop model over time, and
      ultimately, you can kind of imagine a scenario in
      which a <a name="idx-CHP-16-0455"></a>team works together once, has a great experience, commits
      to a meat grinder project on their second project, and then voluntarily
      disbands after that because they would prefer not to sign up for another
      meat grinder project.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Do you think it's possible for a high-performing
      team or a great team to make horrible software, or for a horrible team
      to make great software?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Well, so much of that
      just comes back to how you define a great team and a poor team. I think
      that you can have teams where everybody on the team is highly motivated
      and they're having a great time, but they're completely out of touch
      with business reality, and the people on the team might feel that that
      was a great team but the business does not feel that way.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: This is sort of like your graduate student
      project in a way, right? That you can have a team that for their own
      goals feels like they've done a great job, but for the goals of their
      boss or their company, they've failed</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-16-0456"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: In one of the first
      consulting engagements we had, we were brought in by the president of
      the company, who was a non-technical guy, and he said, "I acquired this
      company, and I've taken over active management of the company, and I've
      got a release date. My technical guys keep telling me, 'Yeah, yeah,
      we're gonna make the release date,' but I've lost all confidence in
      their ability. And frankly, I think these guys are just entranced by how
      cool the technology is and don't care whether we ever ship at
      all."</p>
<p class="docText">And my reaction at the time was here's another classic business
      guy who has no sensitivity to his staff. I'm sure his staff is working
      really hard and he's just not being sensitive to how hard they're
      working. So, we went in and conducted extensive interviews with the
      staff, and to a person, he was right. The stuff they were working on was
      special effects software for the movie industry. It was incredibly cool,
      and truly the staff didn't care whether they ever shipped anything or
      not. They had no sense of business urgency or of getting
      revenue-generating software out the door, and they were having an
      awesome time doing it. I think that is a great example of a case where
      they might have thought they were a great team, but the president
      clearly didn't think they were a great team, and that supposedly great
      team would eventually have run that company out of business.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: So how about the opposite: can an underperforming
      team or horrible team&mdash;a team where everyone is unhappy and doesn't like
      each other&mdash;is it possible for them to make a great piece of
      software?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: I think so. But it's
      because even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while.
      <a name="idx-CHP-16-0457"></a>Morale and <a name="idx-CHP-16-0458"></a>motivation usually go the same direction, but not always.
      One of the distinctions that was made clearly to me a long time ago was
      the distinction between motivation and morale. A lot of times people can
      conflate those two ideas, but you can have high motivation with low
      morale. And you can have high morale with low or misguided
      motivation.</p>
<p class="docText">You can look at sports analogies for the ins and outs of what
      teams work and what teams don't. One of the things that you can find
      lots of examples of in sports teams is that you can have high-performing
      teams where the team members love each other, and every once
      in a while you see a high-performing team where the team members hate
      each other. It isn't common, but it does happen.</p>
<p class="docText">You can have high-performance teams where you've got really
      strong, standout individuals. You can have disastrous teams where you
      have some strong standout individuals. You can also have great teams
      where you've got no real standout individuals, but as a team, they work
      really, really well together.</p>
<p class="docText">And then you can have teams that are just plain mediocre. The
      individuals don't stand out and the team is mediocre. I think all those
      configurations can be found in software teams also.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: So, you studied computer science,
      right?</span><a name="idx-CHP-16-0459"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Yes.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: How much of the curriculum&mdash;the projects you did,
      the assignments you had&mdash;had anything to do with learning about teams, or
      experiencing teams?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Well, so my
      undergraduate degree is in philosophy, and I had my&mdash;</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: There's not much teamwork in
      philosophy</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>:
      <span class="docEmphasis">(Laughs.)</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Unfortunately</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: There is probably more
      than there was in computer science.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Oh, boy</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: I got a minor in
      computer science and I don't know that I had any multiperson
      assignments. When I went to graduate school, one of my explicit goals
      was to get more experience and to get <a name="idx-CHP-16-0460"></a>better at working in teams. And one of the things that was
      attractive about Seattle U's Master in Software Engineering program was
      that many of the assignments were team assignments. It wasn't just the
      final-year project, but many of the assignments, especially the bigger
      assignments, throughout most of the classes were done in teams.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: And was that useful in helping you to understand
      how teams work?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: It was, and now that you
      mention it, I think it would have been helpful if the program had
      actually spent some time talking about how to succeed on team
      assignments versus as individuals, but we stumbled on some good insights
      anyway. But I think it would have been possible for other groups of
      students to not stumble on those insights.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Your experience fits the experience I had at
      Carnegie Mellon University. There were projects when you reached junior
      level, junior year, that were team-based, but by and large, everyone I
      knew in the class formed teams with people they were already friends
      with. And there was no guidance provided on even things as simple as the
      five most likely kinds of conflicts you're going to have. It would take
      a half hour, a short class discussion on the five
      most common kinds of conflict and how to resolve them. But there was
      nothing. And the reason why I asked the question is there is definitely
      a gap here between how people are taught. We are taught you are an
      individual programmer and your goal is to be a master at the craft of
      programming yourself, yet once in the workforce they are put into
      environments that are exclusively team-based</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: I think there's always a
      gap between the craft and the things you care about in your craft versus
      what you get taught academically in school. I agree that the example you
      gave would have been very helpful in my context. Five things that you
      can do to have a smooth team project&mdash;that would have been really
      helpful. Five ways you can mess it up, five things you can do to help it
      go smoothly. That would have been helpful. And I don't think that's
      unique to software. I was involved in a legal dispute a few years ago,
      and I went in and the attorney for the other side made some decisions
      that I thought were just incredible blunders. And even though they
      benefited me, I thought it was not doing their clients much of a
      service. And so I talked to a friend of mine who had gone to Harvard Law
      School, and said, what do you think about this? Is this uncommon that my
      attorney would pay attention and the other party's attorney wouldn't?
      And my friend's response was surprising.</p>
<p class="docText">He said, "Well, one of the things I would do before I went before
      any judge or commissioner, if I hadn't been in front of that judge
      before, I would call people and find out what that judge was like, and I
      would learn everything I could about that judge. I would learn what
      their hot buttons are. I would learn how they tended to rule in the
      past. I would look up their opinions that they've written on similar
      issues. So that when I go into the courtroom, I know how to expect that
      judge to behave." And I said, "Did you learn any of that when you were
      at Harvard Law School?" And he just laughed and said, "No, we didn't
      talk about anything this practical."</p>
<p class="docText">And yet, that ends up, as far as I could tell, being somewhat
      decisive in whether you're going to win or lose. I think any academic
      program has to strike a balance between theory and practice, and there
      is some level where we're probably just getting a little bit too
      practical. It's more like a trade school than an education if you get
      overly practical.</p>
<p class="docText">At the same time, you'd like to think that there are labs or
      studios or something where you could actually get some practical
      experience and maybe what we're saying is there's more of a need for
      some kind of guided studios in software than we often find.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: I'm convinced there's an obligation colleges
      have. If you are putting students in an environment where they're
      experiencing something for the first time, and we know this replicates
      an experience they will have the rest of their careers, there's an
      obligation to at least say, "If you're having problems on your team, go
      to this website, go read this book or come to this workshop." In my
      experience&mdash;and again, my experience was almost 15 years ago&mdash;there was
      nothing. There was not even a conversation about it. You could go to
      your TA (teaching assistant), but your TA was not there to listen to
      what they would see as your social problems. There was a machismo marine
      suck-it-up attitude about anything not related to code. It reinforced
      the idea that to be a good programmer was based
      exclusively on what you could convince a compiler to do, rather than
      what you could convince a person or team to do</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">I admit it's a separate skill set. Being good at
      programming and good at teamwork are unrelated: you can be great at one
      and suck at the other. But when I think of beautiful teams, that's where
      I go. I ask people questions like, what was the first team you were on,
      how did you learn, how did you have any idea what a good team is like.
      They have to at least have an idea of how it is supposed to be, and some
      notions of what behavior are more likely to make the team work well. The
      fact that most CS graduates are highly ignorant of these things is a
      travesty. It's irresponsible, given the nature of how most professional
      programming is done</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">OK. I feel better now. This does all lead to a more
      practical question. Do you think that certain software development
      methods promote greater teamwork than others?</span><a name="idx-CHP-16-0461"></a><a name="idx-CHP-16-0462"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Well, definitely. There
      are certain practices I think contribute to high-performing or effective
      teams.</p>
<p class="docText">In Scrum, for example, I think that communication you get with the
      daily standup meeting is helpful. There are an awful lot of teams where
      people do not see each other face to face every day. In addition, the
      sprint planning, which is typically done at the whole team level, is a
      chance for the team to get together in an in-depth way, in a
      task-focused way, approximately once a month. These activities can be
      used on essentially any kind of project, but they get done on Scrum more
      often because they're built into that particular approach.</p>
<p class="docText">I think there's a point of diminishing returns with <a name="idx-CHP-16-0463"></a>in-person communication in programming. In Extreme
      Programming, there was a heavy emphasis on <a name="idx-CHP-16-0464"></a>pair programming. We see very few companies that have
      retained any emphasis on pair programming. We see organizations that
      make selective use of pairing, but if anything, it's just more
      communication and more interaction than most programmers want.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the common developments we've seen is an almost universal
      presence of <a name="idx-CHP-16-0465"></a>multisite teams. I think that there are various things you
      can do to make the best of teams that are distributed across different
      time zones, but that's exactly what it is. It's making the best of it.
      We almost never see a case where the multiple sites end up providing any
      kind of a net advantage. If it's done really, really well, then it's not
      that much of a net loss.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: So, were any of the high-performing teams that
      you've seen virtual teams? And by virtual I mean that the majority of
      the team does not see each other face to face</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-16-0466"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: I can't think of any.
      And then the other question is what if the team is split across two or
      three different sites or two or three different time zones? And I think
      that you can do reasonably well with two sites. But once you get above
      two sites, it gets much more difficult to do well. You risk having
      extremely low efficiency and lots and lots of communication mistakes and
      tons of rework that arise from communication problems.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: I asked you before about the
      best team experience that you had. What was the worst team experience
      you've ever had? I'm hoping for a horror story to balance out the good
      ones</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: I think I've been lucky
      in my career. I can't think of any teams where I thought the team was a
      bad team. I can think of lots where I felt the team was not an
      exceptional team, but I can't think of any where I thought the whole
      team was just bad. I've had a few experiences where there were one or
      two individuals on a team that really detracted from my personal
      enjoyment from working on the team, but does that make it a bad
      team?</p>
<p class="docText">Well, maybe the interesting question is, can one really bad team
      member ruin a team? And in my experience, I would say yes. It depends
      how bad the person is, but if the person is obnoxious enough, then I
      think it can be pretty bad. I worked in a group earlier in my career, in
      which there was one team member who was extremely territorial about the
      team documentation.</p>
<p class="docText">And so if you went and got the design notebook that had the design
      for a particular section of code you were working on, even if you were
      scheduled to be working on that code for two weeks, she would come at
      lunchtime and grab the notebook off your desk and put it back in her
      area. <span class="docEmphasis">(Laughter.)</span> And so then you'd have to go ask
      her for it again.</p>
<p class="docText">She wasn't using it. She just wanted to be really sure that it
      didn't stay in your area longer than it needed to. And when you're
      working on something for a couple of weeks, and you have to go get the
      notebook 20 times when really you should have had to go get it only
      once, that sort of thing can get irritating. And of course, that's just
      the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Well, here's a more specific situation. If you're
      on a team that's functioning OK, but there's one person that you believe
      is causing the most problems, they are creating the most turmoil, are
      the most difficult to work with, the most sensitive to criticism, but
      the challenge is they happen to be the most talented engineer you have
      on the team&mdash;what do you do?</span><a name="idx-CHP-16-0467"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Well, Gerald Weinberg,
      in his <span class="docEmphasis">Psychology of Computer Programming</span> (Dorset
      House) book, made the blanket statement that if you have a programmer
      that's <a name="idx-CHP-16-0468"></a>indispensable, you should fire him.</p>
<p class="docText">And I read that first in 1989, and when I first read that, I
      thought that was too extreme. But as years have gone by, I have come to
      see the wisdom in that advice. In some organizations, firing may be too
      harsh. But in some way get them off the team, or at least get them off
      the critical path. And my reason for that is the longer you let them
      work in that mode, the bigger the risk becomes of them leaving.</p>
<p class="docText">It is just bad risk management to have a single point of failure
      on a project, and the lowest point that your risk is ever going to be
      with somebody like that is <span class="docEmphasis">today</span>. It doesn't get
      lower by waiting. It just gets higher. And so the sooner you can take
      some kind of action to bring that risk down, the <a name="idx-CHP-16-0469"></a>better off you'll be.</p>
<p class="docText">I've also usually found that that person who
      seems indispensable usually isn't. Usually there's somebody who's
      quietly doing their job who's actually a much stronger contributor than
      the difficult, visible, uncooperative person. And I'm sure that there
      are exceptions, but I think the first-order approximation is that that
      person is probably not as good as you think they are. So number one,
      they represent a super-high risk to your project. Number two, they're
      probably not even that good.</p>
<p class="docText">Number three, they're a drain on everybody else on the team, and
      so the manager in me says, try to find some way to coach them to be
      <a name="idx-CHP-16-0470"></a>better, and if that doesn't work, try to find a way to
      coach them out of the organization. The business owner in me says get
      rid of them as soon as you can, because they're just costing you.</p>
<p class="docText">There was an interesting insight in Larson and Lafasto's study on
      high-performance teams where they described a survey of team members and
      of managers, where managers said that they felt that one of their
      strengths was <a name="idx-CHP-16-0471"></a>dealing with problem team members, whereas team members
      said they felt that one of their managers' greatest weaknesses tended to
      be dealing with problem team members too slowly.</p>
<p class="docText">I think what this says is it says that there's a pretty big gap in
      perception between how effective managers think they are in dealing with
      these issues and how effective they really are, and I think in general,
      when the manager finally takes action on a problem team member, the
      team's reaction is typically not, "Oh, that's so unfair." The team's
      reaction is typically "What took you so long?"</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: How can managers avoid falling into this gap
      between perception and reality?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Working at Construx for
      the last 12 and a half years, we have really explicit company values,
      and two of our values are openness and <a name="idx-CHP-16-0472"></a>accountability, and we have pushed those principles a lot
      further than I have seen at any other company. And after living those
      values for the last 12 and a half years here, I simply do not understand
      how you can run a company or how you can run a team without having very
      strong support for both <a name="idx-CHP-16-0473"></a>openness and accountability.</p>
<p class="docText">And the reason I mention those as a pair is I don't think you can
      have one without the other. You can't have real accountability if you
      don't have openness about who's doing what and how they're performing,
      and whether they're hitting their dates, and whether their quality level
      is good. If that's all sort of kept secret, then it's just too easy to
      not hold people accountable.</p>
<p class="docText">You have to throw it out in the open. Otherwise, it's too subject
      to gaming and you don't get input on whether you've really got the right
      information, all that kind of stuff. Likewise, if you have just the
      openness but you don't have the accountability, then people think you're
      incredibly inept, or that you're just asleep at the switch, because
      you're seeing that some people are doing well and some people keep
      missing their dates, and you're not doing anything about it. So, if you
      don't have accountability there, then the openness actually becomes a
      problem rather than an asset.</p>
<p class="docText">And just in terms of being able to manage
      workflow and address personnel issues in a timely way, and address all
      the zillions of little teamwork issues that come up, if you're
      constantly saying, well, should we expose this item or should we tell
      so-and-so about this, it just becomes this incredible drag on your
      efficiency, as you're spending half your time talking about who should
      know what and how are we going to protect so-and-so's feelings and that
      kind of thing.</p>
<p class="docText">Whereas if you just throw everything out on the table, it makes it
      really easy, and I know that's not the only possible way to run an
      effective organization, but for my personality, I just cannot imagine
      going through all the overhead of doing it any other way. I don't know
      how you can have an effective organization without really strong
      <a name="idx-CHP-16-0474"></a>accountability. And I think most organizations give lip
      service to the accountability word, and don't have anything that would
      look to me like real accountability.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: What you're saying is terrifying to most people,
      especially to people in power. Whoever's in charge has the greatest to
      fear in being open and accountable, because they have the largest number
      of people who can challenge their authority</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-16-0475"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Very few people, in my experience, who seek out power,
      are simultaneously interested in being as open and as accountable to the
      people that they want power over. It's rare. It's not impossible. There
      have been managers and executives I've worked for that I feel embody the
      same thing you're talking about, but it's rare. I think it's probably
      rarer than high-performing teams</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Yeah, I just don't know
      how else you could do it. The interesting thing about a software
      organization is you're basically talking about directing how people are
      thinking. That is what we pay people to do. We pay them to think, and
      you cannot stand over somebody with a whip and tell them what to
      think.</p>
<p class="docText">You have to make them want to think the things that they're paid
      to think. And there's a very real sense in which you give over your soul
      as a programmer in ways that you don't give over your soul if you were
      operating a piece of heavy machinery or standing behind a counter,
      talking to people. Because when you're doing those operations, you can
      think whatever you want to.</p>
<p class="docText">Your mind is your own, but as a programmer, you are actually
      renting out space in your brain, and hopefully, a significant amount of
      space in your brain, to somebody else for commercial purposes. And so
      the idea that when you're paying people to think that you can somehow
      keep things a secret and deceive them into thinking what you want them
      to think, I just don't think that makes any sense. I think maybe you can
      get away with it in the short run, but I don't think you'll ever get
      away with it in the long run.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: I agree with you, but I can't explain the
      practices, the actual behavior that I see at a lot of the companies that
      I visit and speak to. I agree with you in principle, yet I'm convinced
      the majority of work environments don't live up to anywhere near the
      standard that you're describing. And part of me wants to say that it has
      something to do with the size of an organization.
      That the more layers there are, the harder it is to maintain in the
      whole openness and accountability. You have
      pockets</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-16-0476"></a><a name="idx-CHP-16-0477"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Yeah.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: And a manager might say, "my unit, my team, my
      group" is open. There are often pockets within the group where there is
      openness and accountability. But across the company, across a division,
      there isn't. There's a tribalness to it. Beyond the size of a small
      tribe, it's extremely hard to maintain</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-16-0478"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: The bigger you get, the
      harder it is.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: Right</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: And we do have an asset
      of being small, and having said that, I have worked for several
      companies as small as or smaller than we are now that have been highly
      political. So, it's not a foregone conclusion that when you're small,
      you are automatically open.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: OK, here's your last question. So let's say I am
      an individual contributor. I'm a programmer on a team that is not
      functioning well. It's a bad team. Your list of criteria for
      high-performing teams, we embody the opposite for all of them&mdash;not all of
      them; we are semifunctioning. We're a dysfunctional team, but it's not a
      good team, and before I decide to leave, what's my list of things I
      should be thinking about doing to try to help the team environment for
      the team that I'm on? Is there anything I can do?</span><a name="idx-CHP-16-0479"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: Yeah, I think so. You
      can lead from the front as well as leading from the rear, and I think
      most of the things that I've described as being critical to team
      formation can be done by an individual contributor.</p>
<p class="docText">You can define an elevating vision. You can figure out why what
      you're doing matters and communicate that to the rest of your team. You
      can organize team activities, both at work or outside of work. The first
      team that I mentioned was, I think, very much a case of that, where the
      team formed in spite of the boss, rather than because of him, and, in
      fact, a big part of the team identity was that we all thought the boss
      was a greedy jerk.</p>
<p class="docText">And so I do think that it does require that somebody exercises
      some leadership, and by leadership, I mean they figure out where they
      want to go and then they try to lead other people to wherever that is.
      And where you want to go is part of it and how you want to get there is
      another part of it.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the things that you see in technical organizations is the
      distinction between the official <a name="idx-CHP-16-0480"></a>management hierarchy and the unofficial <a name="idx-CHP-16-0481"></a>expertise hierarchy. And a lot of times the unofficial
      expertise hierarchy affects day-to-day operations a lot more than the
      official management hierarchy. It's interesting, because there's some
      guy who doesn't show up on the org chart who is the guy who everybody
      goes to to get their question answered, or who everybody defers to when
      it comes down to key technical strategy questions. And most orgs
      eventually identify those guys and they show up somehow or other on some
      corner of the org chart, but that's a form of leadership where there's
      no budget attached.</p>
<p class="docText">There's no title necessarily attached to it,
      but that person is demonstrating some leadership, and I think that
      person is in a position to make the team experience better or worse for
      everybody else.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Scott: We've talked for over an hour now. What key idea
      do you think most people haven't heard about regarding
      teams?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Steve</span>: We see far too seldom
      any effort or thought put into even trying to create teams. The kinds of
      practices that I described earlier might not be guaranteed to create a
      beautiful team, but not doing them is almost guaranteed to prevent a
      beautiful team. And I don't think companies have to spend a lot of
      money. I don't think they have to have a great deal of expertise in
      trying to make their teams work better together. I think even a little
      bit really can go a long way.</p>
<p class="docText">I would say that less than a third of the companies we work with
      have any sort of explicit morale budget or team event budget, and that's
      just shocking. The companies we work with that do have those budgets,
      the budgets aren't large. They're a few hundred or a couple thousand
      dollars a year, maybe, where you're looking at payroll cost for a team
      is probably a million dollars. I mean, for a small team, the payroll
      cost is a million dollars, and we're talking about a couple thousand
      dollars for team building? It's a tiny percentage, but very, very high
      leverage.</p>
