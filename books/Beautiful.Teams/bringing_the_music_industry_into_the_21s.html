<h4>One Lawsuit at a Time</h4>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Tom Tarka</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">WE HAD BEEN ON THE GROUND AT LAX FOR ABOUT
      TWO MINUTES WHEN A VOICE CAME ON THE INTERCOM</span> and said,
      "Would passenger Thomas Tarka please see the attendant at the front of
      the plane &#8230;."</p>
<p class="docText">My ears perked up and my somewhat groggy mind came to attention,
      playing out all of the potential scenarios.</p>
<p class="docText">Another one of my grandparents had fallen deathly ill and I needed
      to call my parents immediately?</p>
<p class="docText">Smugglers had sequestered drugs in my bag and the International
      Terminal drug-sniffing dogs had already found them?</p>
<p class="docText">I shuffled with the rest of the coach passengers, already thrown
      for a loop by a simple sentence on the intercom and not able to do a
      thing about it other than to carry my overstuffed bag and wait for the
      eternity it always seems to take to get to the front of the plane after
      a long international flight.</p>
<p class="docText">And so it was that I returned to the United States after circling
      the globe &#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">Ten months prior I had been living in Boulder
      and working as a keyboard jockey in various forms, starting off as a
      software tester and eventually working my way up the food chain to
      webmaster at a smallish software company. I wasn't sold on Boulder, and
      a tip from some backpackers at a hostel in Hawaii about the relatively
      inexpensive nature of "Round the World" plane tickets had put the bug in
      my ear to save my money, dust off my passport, and check out the rest of
      the world.</p>
<p class="docText">Jobwise I was also ready for a change, in large part because I had
      spent the majority of my career thus far working mostly alone or as the
      sole tech person on projects. It was lonely, and I was jonesing for
      people to geek out with. Case in point: it was fun being the webmaster
      for the company I worked for, but the website was run by the marketing
      department and left me working with amazing but
      non-Unix/programming/techie types, and it was getting old. It probably
      didn't help that a few of my friends had moved to the Bay Area, and
      through their tales I had heard the siren song of the dot-com, with its
      hordes of geeks staying up all night coding, building "Cool Stuff"&#8482; and
      maybe even getting rich in the process. I was ready to move on, and I
      was pretty sure working as a programmer at a dot-com was the next step.
      It didn't hurt that the economy was booming and looking for people with
      my skill set, and I was banking on the fact that I could get away for a
      few months and, in all likelihood, not have any major issues finding a
      job, either. And so it was that in September 1998 I had left my job as a
      webmaster, packed up the last of my belongings, and driven cross-country
      to New York City, hopping on a plane to London a scant 48 hours after
      leaving Colorado.</p>
<p class="docText">Ten months and 45 minutes later I was in the back seat of a
      station wagon being driven by two people I didn't know, lost somewhere
      in the middle of L.A., staring about in wonderment at everything:
      eight-lane freeways, gridlock, Christian billboards confiding to me that
      my taking the Lord's name in vain was the reason that I was still stuck
      in traffic, the funny American cars of all shapes, waxed and gleaming,
      squat buildings and never-ending sprawl &#8230;. L.A.&mdash;no,
      <span class="docEmphasis">America</span> washed over me for the first time in almost
      10 months, bigger than anything I had seen in what seemed like a
      lifetime, or if not bigger, then just <span class="docEmphasis">different</span> in
      some ineffable way that mirrored an attitude which had become in so many
      ways foreign to me. I was home, but it wasn't my home anymore.</p>
<p class="docText">The driver of the car was a friend of Connie-Lynne, someone I had
      known online for maybe two years but had never met in person. She was
      also the person who had phoned the airline to leave me a message which
      read something along the lines of "Message for Tommy Tarka. Constance
      will not be able to pick you up at the airport, but has sent someone who
      will meet you at the gate." So, I was in a car headed for Pasadena,
      driven by someone I didn't know who was taking me to someone's house
      that I had never actually met who I was going to stay with for a couple
      of days until Mark arrived from Phoenix.</p>
<p class="docText">Mark, of course, was an old college (and traveling) buddy who had
      driven cross-country from Pennsylvania and was meeting up with me in
      L.A. after spending some time visiting family in Phoenix. He had just
      finished up his master's degree at Penn State and it was our intention
      to take a lackadaisical cross-country jaunt, exploring the United States
      until such a time when we found ourselves back on
      the Eastern seaboard, where it just so happened that my remaining
      possessions (including my car) were ferreted away in various attics,
      storage sheds, and living rooms spread across three cities.</p>
<p class="docText">Connie-Lynne turned out to be as amazing and nice as I fully knew
      her to be after two years of chatting online, Mark and I managed to
      rendezvous, and three days later we were in San Diego visiting
      friends&mdash;JV and klh&mdash;who were from different places and times in our lives
      but who had independently ended up there. We had just finished throwing
      the disc around and had retired to klh's UCSD campus apartment when I
      happened to mention:</p>
<p class="docText">"You know, I wouldn't actually mind sticking around in San Diego
      for a couple of months, especially since JV's wedding is only a few
      weeks away and the likelihood of me <a name="idx-CHP-7-0144"></a>getting back here for it is pretty slim if I'm off
      gallivanting somewhere else in the country. I'd have to find some sort
      of job, though, so if you guys know of any frictional work for a sys
      admin or a Unix geek, please let me know."</p>
<p class="docText">It's one of those things that seem perfectly natural after
      backpacking for a while, floating from place to place on a schedule that
      is dictated more by weather patterns or where the next bus is heading as
      opposed to anything else more concrete. And so the words were spoken
      with every intention of actually doing just that: hanging around San
      Diego for six weeks until your good friend's wedding, but with no
      expectation that anything would actually come of it. Besides, after 10
      months of travel, I was pretty much broke and there was no way I could
      stick around San Diego for six weeks unless I could find some sort of
      job, preferably a lucrative geek-type job to bolster the coffers. The
      whole thing boiled down to finances.</p>
<p class="docText">Which is why I was surprised when I got the response, "Oh, really?
      Did you tell JV that? Our friend David is working for a start-up and I
      think they're hiring. What do you do?"</p>
<p class="docText">Oh, my.</p>
<p class="docText">And so the connection was made. Mark and I returned to L.A., but
      three days later I was riding the Surfliner&mdash;the Amtrak train which
      follows the Pacific Coast down to San Diego&mdash;and hopping a cab to
      interview at <a name="idx-CHP-7-0145"></a>MP3.com, a company I knew absolutely nothing about. Adding
      to the sheer absurdity of this situation&mdash;from my seeing America with
      fresh eyes for the first time to the "ask the universe and ye shall
      receive" scenario of finding out about this job&mdash;I had managed to leave
      the bag containing pretty much my only set of nice pants and
      clean/presentable shirts in the trunk of someone's car the night before.
      I showed up to the interview in the best clothes I had with me: shorts,
      a somewhat wrinkled, albeit two-button V-neck, collared shirt emblazoned
      with beer logos and commemorating a chapter of the Hash House Harriers
      club, with feet shod in, if I recall correctly, sandals. I was
      completely stressed out by the whole scenario, but the early hour of
      travel (meaning everything was closed), inability to easily reroute (as
      I was traveling on public transportation), and lack of time to spare
      between connections made it impossible to do much more than ride it out
      and put on my best face.</p>
<p class="docText">"Yeah, we were taking bets on how long you'd
      last," said Josh Beck, CTO, as he later recalled interviewing me that
      day.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-7-0146"></a>MP3.com was completely hopping that day. It was the day
      before the IPO, and everyone was running around like mad men and women,
      cell phones glued to ears and fighting off a recent crash of some
      nature, brought on by the sudden onslaught of pre-IPO media blitz and
      resultant web traffic. At least half of my interviews took place on a
      park bench outside in the ever-perfect San Diego weather as engineers
      with obviously more important stuff to do took a deep breath before
      calmly trying to find out more about this crazy-looking guy fresh off a
      plane " &#8230; from where? Fiji?" and the
      probably-not-yet-of-legal-drinking-age CTO quizzed me on Perl modules (I
      knew the answers to his DBI questions but wasn't familiar with Carp at
      the time).</p>
<p class="docText">You'd think that after 10 months of globe-trotting my skills would
      have languished, but just the opposite was true. I spent quite a few of
      my days also geeking out: sitting in the Singapore library reading books
      on artificial intelligence, working temp programming or sys admin jobs
      to make some spare cash (or at least to get free coffee and Internet
      access in the case of the Internet Cafe that doubled as an open source
      software development shop, with most of the computer minders also
      working as developers on the side), and learning the ins and outs of DBI
      while working on a ride-sharing website of mine. I returned with a gap
      in my work history, but with reasonable programming chops in skills
      that, it turns out, were topical to what MP3.com did. Somehow this makes
      me feel better about the days that I spent in Bondi, sitting out on the
      porch in the beautiful sunshine and hacking away on Perl code via a
      strung-together 386/16 (running FVWM on 12 or 16 megs of RAM and
      connecting in through a 33k modem) instead of frolicking on the beach.
      Somehow.</p>
<p class="docText">Four hours later there was an offer on the table and we were
      discussing salary and benefits. The fact that the IPO was the next
      day&mdash;and that the actual contract wouldn't be ready until then, not to
      mention the fact that I probably needed at least a week to recover all
      my stuff from the East Coast&mdash;meant that I was screwed on stock options:
      instead of locking in at an option price of a dollar or two per share,
      I'd end up at whatever the stock price was after going public (my option
      price ended up being somewhere in the $50 to $65 range); so much for
      getting rich quick. I was kind of pissed, but at the same time I knew
      that this was my bargaining chip for an actual salary, as opposed to the
      peanuts some folks managed to get by on&mdash;banking, of course, on their
      options vesting at a price that would make the small salary moot&mdash;and did
      my best to use the situation to my advantage. I came away with a salary
      lower than I wanted, but with a promise that I would be bumped up to
      something more acceptable in a few months. Good enough, especially with
      how much I wanted the job.</p>
<p class="docText">And so not even two weeks after returning to the country I had
      managed to land the job that I had dreamed of: working at a fast-paced,
      up-and-coming dot-com. I was disappointed that I wasn't going to be able
      to travel the States a bit and felt bad about leaving Mark in the lurch
      with regard to our plans of lazy exploration, yet it was an opportunity
      of a lifetime. There would be (and was) time for exploring later; for
      now, I had a job!</p>
