<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">AROUND THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM, I HAD A
      GREAT EXPERIENCE. I WAS BROUGHT IN TO HELP ONE</span> of our clients
      get a new project started. They were new to <a name="idx-CHP-15-0368"></a>object-oriented (OO) design, and I was supposed to help
      them get an OO architecture defined and an initial plan in place. As it
      turned out, I spent almost half a year with them every other week. This
      was a time of great learning for them and for me. Not only did we have
      some fine accomplishments, but we also spent some time in
      turmoil.</p>
<p class="docText">The company, call it By the Book Systems (BBS), was very
      structured and prided itself on its quality and conformance to its
      processes. Like many big companies, BBS sometimes did things that hurt
      itself. In this tale, we'll see some of the brave and great things that
      were done at BBS and some outright blunders that can kill team morale
      and stifle progress.</p>
<p class="docText">Starting a new project is fun. I've had the pleasure of starting
      quite a few projects in my career, and it was good to be part of a team
      at BBS. As a consultant, I am too often an outsider, being on the team
      for only short periods of time. In this case, I was with BBS almost
      every other week. So, I really became part of the team.</p>
<p class="docText">The team started small: initially Johnny (the systems engineer),
      Alan (the lead engineer), and me.</p>
<p class="docText">The first order of business was for Johnny to
      brief me on the <a name="idx-CHP-15-0369"></a>requirements of the project. He had a 30-page requirements
      document written by the book with the shoulds and shalls just as
      prescribed.</p>
<p class="docText">The requirements document had plenty of good information in it,
      but in that form it was almost totally unactionable. Even with the
      requirements prioritized, it was not clear what the software had to do.
      Software does things; we needed an inventory describing what the
      software had to do. Thankfully, there is a popular solution to this
      problem. <a name="idx-CHP-15-0370"></a>Use cases are used to catalog and define system behaviors.
      Use cases would really help us get a handle on what the software should,
      shall, and must do.</p>
<p class="docText">We had a small problem, though. Johnny had not used use cases
      before. If use cases were not part of the standard process, we might
      have to do some formal justification. We pulled out the process manual
      and discovered, much to our pleasure, that use cases were one of the
      acceptable forms for requirements articulation. That was good
      news.</p>
<p class="docText">Johnny and I locked ourselves in his office. As we read the
      requirements document, we discussed what the requirements meant and what
      the implied system behavior was. We named use case after use case,
      capturing them in a spreadsheet. After about a week's effort, we had
      extracted 105 use cases from Johnny's requirements document and we
      identified nine actors outside our system's boundaries. We understood
      the system boundaries and the system behaviors, at least at a talking
      and planning level. This activity is called <span class="docEmphasis">use case
      identification</span>. The idea is to name all the
      behaviors.<a name="idx-CHP-15-0371"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Around that time, Kent Beck published his book, <span class="docEmphasis">Extreme
      Programming Explained</span> [1]. It was all the buzz. Wars raged on
      the newly formed Yahoo! Groups and the established comp.object
      newsgroup. A great opportunity presented itself. Object Mentor, my
      employer at the time, had cornered the market on <a name="idx-CHP-15-0372"></a>Extreme Programming (XP). Well, that's not really
      accurate, but it sounds cool. What really happened is that Bob Martin,
      Jim Newkirk, and Lowell Lindstrom (the Object Mentor management team)
      had formed an alliance with Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and Martin Fowler
      to train people in XP. Lowell invited me to attend the first XP
      Immersion. I took the week off from BBS to get immersed in XP. What an
      impact that unexpected week at the Deerfield, Illinois, Marriott had on
      me. It amazes me how small events can have such a profound
      effect.</p>
<p class="docText">I must admit, most of the world knew very little about XP and I
      was in the same boat. What I had heard concerned me. How could something
      called <span class="docEmphasis">Extreme</span> really be a good idea unless it had
      to do with skiing? Were helmets required, or elbow pads? Would I need a
      new life insurance policy? I think Kent was being provocative and I am
      glad he was. If it had been called something like <span class="docEmphasis">Sensible
      Programming</span>, everyone would have yawned, and the waterfall
      process would have been kept as the ideal. As it happens, that simple,
      small book has made many people challenge the status quo.</p>
<p class="docText">After my week at Immersion, I returned to BBS with the enthusiasm
      of the newly converted. OK, I am exaggerating. I was never religious
      about XP, but thought many of the ideas could really break some logjams
      at BBS.</p>
<p class="docText">I started telling my colleagues about the
      interesting and revolutionary techniques in XP. They were interested,
      but reserved. "The quality people will never let us do something called
      Extreme," said Alan. Johnny was worried that more upfront design work
      and documentation were needed than XP prescribed. The big process
      culture made it difficult to imagine that a lightweight process like XP
      could be a good idea.</p>
