        wanting to be a part of <a name="idx-CHP-18-0536"></a>NASA? We sure did. That's why we were excited when we
        got in touch with Peter Gl&uuml;ck, who's been working on and running
        software teams for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for more
        than 20 years. We wanted to know what it was like to work on a NASA
        team, and even more, what it was like to send his software into space,
        where it has to work and you can't just walk over and patch it.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Tell us a little bit about
      your background, how you came to be at NASA, and the kinds of projects
      you've worked on</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-18-0537"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I have a master's degree
      in aerospace engineering and a bachelor's in mathematics. I actually
      went on a field trip in fourth grade to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
      here in Pasadena, and came home that day and said, "Mom, when I grow up,
      I want to work at JPL."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, you've wanted to work with NASA since you
      were a little kid</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yeah, so I was kind of
      focused as a youngster. Actually, at one point, I wanted to join the Air
      Force and fly jets, but my vision precluded that.</p>
<p class="docText">I went to Cal State Northridge, and while I was there I had a
      class with a girl whose father worked here. She got me an interview, and
      I've been here for 22 years. That's how I got started at NASA.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Tell us a little bit about the projects you've
      done, especially in terms of the kind of software. We want to talk about
      teams in general, and the kinds of teams that build software in
      particular, and teams that work well together</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Teams can be a
      challenge. Getting people together that have the right mix of <a name="idx-CHP-18-0538"></a>skills and the right mix of personalities can sometimes be
      a challenge.</p>
<p class="docText">I worked on many flight missions here at JPL for my entire career,
      from Magellan back in the 1980s&mdash;which was a Venus radar mapper&mdash;to Mars
      Observer, which made it to within three days of Mars and then
      disappeared. I worked on the TOPEX/Poseidon mission which was an
      Earth-orbiting oceanographic satellite, and then on the ground systems
      for the Cassini mission.</p>
<p class="docText">Deep Space 1 was my first leadership role where I led the flight
      systems control software team doing the Deep Space 1 mission for three
      years.</p>
<p class="docText">I was on Phoenix for the last four and a half years. I was the
      project software systems engineer responsible for the overall
      development of both the flight and ground software for the entire
      mission. I have since moved on to the advanced optical systems program
      at JPL.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds like you've had your hands full with a
      lot of really big projects over the years</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yeah, a lot of different
      stuff, including a couple I didn't mention.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, you said that getting teams together can be
      tough. What's tough about it? Specifically, what challenges have you
      seen in the past</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-18-0539"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Well, there're two
      things. One is finding the right skill mix. You need people of different
      capabilities and different tastes, frankly. You can't have a team that's
      just a bunch of code hackers, because you need people who can also do
      the documentation and the systems engineering
      <a name="idx-CHP-18-0540"></a>and can run the test program. You need people that can
      interface with the customer.</p>
<p class="docText">In any successful team, you're going to find that there's a
      variety of people; so one aspect is the technical skills of the team
      members.</p>
<p class="docText">The second aspect is the <a name="idx-CHP-18-0541"></a>personalities. Some people are more withdrawn, some people
      are more outgoing, and to some extent you can't have it all skewed one
      way or the other. You need to find the right balance in personalities so
      that people can get along. You have too many people with strong
      personalities and they're going to lock horns.</p>
<p class="docText">On the other hand, if you have too many people who are meek, then
      you might not get the best ideas coming forward. You need to have a
      balance. And you need to have an environment where people feel safe in
      communicating their concerns and their ideas.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Can you think of a time that stands out where in
      a team you worked on everything just meshed well, where you had an ideal
      mix of talent and personalities</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-18-0542"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I guess I've been pretty
      fortunate that most of the teams that I've been a part of have been
      pretty good here; some better than others.</p>
<p class="docText">But in general, I guess I'd say the Deep Space 1 team was a pretty
      tight-knit team. Our software team, especially, was a very good team. I
      think we had a lot of good relationships. There were some members of the
      integration and test team that used to lock horns a bit, but overall I
      think that was a really good team.</p>
<p class="docText">The Phoenix team was also really a great team to be a part of. The
      software developers were all very sharp, mostly very willing to
      accommodate whatever the project needed.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think that locking horns is something
      that always tends to be good for a project, or is it something that can
      go either way</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I don't think it's
      always a terribly good thing, actually. I think that there needs to be a
      forum for discourse, but at the end of the day, you've got to have
      people that are willing to accept whatever the direction of the project
      is.</p>
<p class="docText">We have some very, very bright people here at JPL, much brighter
      than I am in many respects. I have seen those people just deadlock the
      entire team to the point where you can't get a solid direction one way
      or the other, because you've got these two or more individuals who
      simply won't budge from their righteousness, and that's
      counterproductive.</p>
<p class="docText">To some extent, you need some healthy skepticism, some healthy
      exchange of differing viewpoints. But at the end of the day, there needs
      to be one decision to go down a certain path and everybody needs to be
      able to accept that and contribute for the good of the project.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds like if there has
      to be one decision, that's a role for a team leader, somebody who has
      not just the authority, but maybe the respect of the team to get
      everybody to move past the disagreement and accept the
      decision</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-18-0543"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Do think that has an effect on the ability for
      the team to gel? When you're leading a team, is there anything in
      particular that you do</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: That is an interesting
      question.</p>
<p class="docText">The job of a team leader is an awful lot of <a name="idx-CHP-18-0544"></a>diplomacy, at least on Phoenix. The last four years I've
      had to deal with three different large institutions: the University of
      Arizona, the Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company in Denver, and the
      Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>
<p class="docText">I had developers each independently developing their own software
      at all three institutions. And not to mention all of the contractual
      agreements and the management chains of command and all that. Diplomacy
      is a skill that you have to have in that kind of environment.</p>
<p class="docText">In terms of getting the teams to gel together, one of the things
      that I like to do is provide some team-building activities. Now, when
      you're scattered across time zones like this, it's a little difficult.
      And it may sound silly, but one of the things that I used with some
      success is fantasy football.</p>
<p class="docText">I invited everybody to join a fantasy football league, and I got
      about a dozen people to join it, not so much in the software team, but
      across the different teams that we worked with. There were members of
      the operations team, members of the integration and test team, members
      of the software team, and members of the systems engineering team all
      involved in this activity, and it's just a little something that you can
      talk about, and kind of humanizes everybody.</p>
<p class="docText">Otherwise, you end up where you're always dealing on a
      professional level. I think it's easy to lose sight of the fact that
      there is a person back there who has feelings and does the same things
      that everybody does.</p>
<p class="docText">That's definitely one technique that I try to use.</p>
<p class="docText">The other thing that I do is I try to make myself available to
      anybody who has any questions or concerns. I have an open-door policy.
      Anyone can come and talk to me about anything that's concerning them at
      any time. If there's a serious problem, we'll try and get it resolved.
      Sometimes they just want to get something off their chests, and it
      doesn't go any further.</p>
<p class="docText">I think those are probably the two most important things in my
      toolbox.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: And what about in the way that you build software
      in general? I know that NASA is known for being pretty process-heavy. Do
      you want to talk about how the process itself impacts your team and how
      you feel, as somebody who's working on software that's scrutinized a
      lot</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-18-0545"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Well, process-heavy, I
      don't know&mdash;it may very well be that the manned program is far more
      process-heavy than we are. Actually, to be honest, in the last 10 years,
      we've become fairly <a name="idx-CHP-18-0546"></a>process-oriented at JPL. And frankly, our industry
      partners have been well ahead of us in that area, although I think we're
      beginning to gain parity with them.</p>
<p class="docText">But we do have certain rules we have to follow, and we have a
      coding standard like any good software house would. We have a design
      life cycle that we follow. We have some institutional standards and
      practices.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the things that you have to do as the leader of the team is
      to make sure, a) that everybody is aware of the standards and processes;
      b) that they're trained on how to interpret them and use them; and c)
      that they actually get used so there's an aspect of verification that
      goes with that.</p>
<p class="docText">But I haven't generally had problems with that in the past. People
      are generally pretty receptive, at least the ones that I've worked with,
      to accepting the limitations of being in this environment.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Can you take a few minutes and describe the
      process that you guys use to build software</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Well, I have to be a
      little careful here because I do have to be conscious of ITAR
      restrictions.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What is ITAR</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: <a name="idx-CHP-18-0547"></a>International Traffic in Arms Regulations. It's a federal
      law that prevents us from disclosing details about defense-related
      technologies; spacecraft are classified as a <a name="idx-CHP-18-0548"></a>defense-related technology.</p>
<p class="docText">So, I can't give you any specifics, but we use a standard
      waterfall-type life cycle here. Sometimes it's iterative, so you'll have
      a series of builds that you'll establish and you'll build up
      functionality, moving towards your end goal of a fully functional
      system.</p>
<p class="docText">You have your requirements, your design, your integration phases.
      People are pretty familiar with that here. There have been new people
      that come in and become familiar with it very quickly.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I'm kind of having a bit of an almost
      disappointing, "I put my pants on one leg at a time" moment. I always
      imagined that NASA had some incredible, intricate way of building
      things. But it sounds like you guys just do the same things that
      everybody else does, except you need to be a lot more careful and maybe
      rigorous about it. And I guess it's because your software has to work
      millions of miles away, where there's no you way you can get to
      it</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-18-0549"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: That's true.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: How do you cope with that</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: A lot of testing. We do
      a lot of testing, and we have a lot of systems engineering that goes
      into it. We have an integrated team. Frequently, you have people who are
      members of both the systems engineering team for
      the spacecraft or the mission and also members of the software
      team.</p>
<p class="docText">Where it tends to come together is in the area of <a name="idx-CHP-18-0550"></a>fault protection. You'll have a team of two or three or
      four fault protection engineers who are systems engineers that are
      looking at the entire system, what can go wrong with the system and
      what, if anything, you can do to correct it. They're also part of the
      software team and helping to write the specifications for the software
      that has to do that.</p>
<p class="docText">That's really where it all comes together. <a name="idx-CHP-18-0551"></a>Fault protection and fault management is a big part of
      what makes our missions able to survive for extended periods of time
      without any direct interaction from the operators.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I know that there are some people who are going
      to be reading this who aren't quite sure exactly how fault protection
      works, how testing works in general. Without breaching any federal laws,
      can you tell us a little bit about how you guys go about testing this
      kind of software</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yes, I can give you the
      general overview. It's important to have&mdash;let's see, one, it's important
      to have visibility into what the software's doing, so you don't want to
      have any hidden commands, data, features.</p>
<p class="docText">Everything needs to be accessible so that you can actually see
      what's going on inside the software to the largest extent possible.
      Obviously, you're not going to publish every counter or every loop
      variable or every intermediate state. But to the extent that there's a
      hardware measurement available, you want that to be visible from the
      user's perspective.</p>
<p class="docText">The second thing is you need to have platforms that you can test
      on. In the last 10 years, what we do largely is a software-based
      simulator.</p>
<p class="docText">You have a software simulator that can run on a workstation and it
      basically models the environment that the spacecraft software operates
      in. You have models of the avionics systems. You have models of the
      vehicle dynamics; by that, I mean the rotational and translational
      motions of the vehicle. You have models of the planets and whatever
      external factors are of importance to your system.</p>
<p class="docText">Then, you can operate software in an environment that simulates
      what it's going to expect to see in operations. You run tests in that
      way and you confirm that the behavior is what you expect it to be, both
      nominal and off-nominal cases, so that you can identify places where
      fault protection is working correctly and maybe places where you need to
      beef it up in some way.</p>
<p class="docText">We also take advantage of <a name="idx-CHP-18-0552"></a>hardware test beds. That's your highest-fidelity test bed.
      You actually build duplicate electronics and you put them in a hardware
      test bed, and then you command the software in a flight-like way. You
      observe how it behaves, and hopefully it behaves as you expected it
      to.</p>
<p class="docText">That's the best way to do it, but you're
      limited by the fact that hardware generally operates in real time. There
      are two problems there. One is the time it takes, and the other is that
      it costs a lot of money to get the extra set of hardware. So, you're
      really limited to only a couple of hardware test beds and can't do a
      whole lot on them. You rely on software test beds because they can
      generally run faster than real time, and you duplicate those on as many
      workstations as you can buy.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: First of all, thank you for the explanation;
      it's really interesting. It occurs to me that if you went to, say, your
      typical programming team building typical business applications at a
      company, and you expected them to put in that kind of testing, that
      level of quality engineering, you'd have a minor revolt on your
      hands</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-18-0553"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Which is the reason why
      our missions to Mars cost $400 million, and your typical business
      application only costs $1 million to develop. You're looking at a
      difference in scale and in cost of failure.</p>
<p class="docText">The cost of failure if a business application doesn't work quite
      right is a few irate customers. It can be bad for the business if they
      really get it wrong, but chances are in the nominal cases it's going to
      work fine, and in the off-nominal cases they'll get some complaints and
      they can issue a patch.</p>
<p class="docText">If we get it wrong in the off-nominal cases, we may not get a
      second chance.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I'm guessing that unlike a business team, the
      actual team members, even just the most junior programmers on the team,
      will have a more focused attitude towards quality, an appreciation of
      quality among the people who are actually building the software. And
      maybe even an appreciation of the project itself</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yes, I think that people
      who work here generally feel privileged to be here. I know I certainly
      do. It's a unique place to work. There are certainly some disadvantages
      to being here, but there are an awful lot of advantages with respect to
      just the opportunity to work on the things that we work on.</p>
<p class="docText">I think that most people here are very conscientious and really
      trying to do the best they can. They understand that the things we're
      doing are difficult, and therefore require attention to detail.</p>
<p class="docText">And to the extent that we might miss something because we're all
      human, we have a robust test program that tries to shake out all of the
      major defects. We certainly aren't going to get every defect, but if we
      can get all the major ones, then we're doing well.</p>
<p class="docText">The goal is to make the spacecraft survivable so that nothing that
      we did during development is going to cause it to be lost. That's the
      main thing: to make the spacecraft robust so that it can protect itself
      until we can figure out what went wrong and correct it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I'm guessing that all of that attention to
      detail, that attention to quality, the awareness of the need to get it
      right, and just the general feeling of being privileged to</span>
<span class="docEmphasis">work there, that's got to have a positive
      effect on teams and their ability to gel quickly and actually get moving
      in the same direction</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: I have another question. One of the things that
      some of the people we've been talking to have brought up as a problem in
      making teams gel is that a lot of times people will have divergent
      goals. They'll understand the project a little bit differently from
      their teammates</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-18-0554"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Do you think that that's something that you've
      encountered in JPL, or is that something that pretty much everybody
      gets? We're sending a spacecraft to Mars, and that's the goal of the
      project</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yeah, I think on the
      flight projects that I've worked on, people are pretty well oriented
      towards the goal and what the project's supposed to do.</p>
<p class="docText">On a day-to-day basis, you occasionally have someone who heads off
      in the wrong direction and does something that's not exactly what you
      expected, but generally the high-level goal is understood and everybody
      understands the seriousness of what can happen if we don't get it right
      the first time.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Does that have an impact on how well people work
      together</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I think the things that
      probably affect the day-to-day operations of the team are, one, the
      natures of the personalities, as I mentioned earlier. And two, it's not
      all rainbows and roses here. While we are certainly honored and
      privileged to be here, along with that comes a lot of
      responsibility.</p>
<p class="docText">I tend to be more laid back, but I know people who really do
      stress out over the fact that what they're doing is so critical.</p>
<p class="docText">There are often long hours for many months. We have to hit
      planetary launch windows that are about three weeks long and only come
      around once every two years or so. You really don't have an option to
      slip a launch.</p>
<p class="docText">If you slip a launch, it costs tens, if not hundreds of millions
      of dollars, because you've got to then keep being staffed up for the
      time that you are waiting for the next window to come around. You've got
      equipment to store. You've got additional facilities to keep running.
      There are all kinds of costs involved. We really do try very, very hard
      to meet the launch window.</p>
<p class="docText">There's a lot of stress involved, too, and there have been many
      documented cases of personal problems occurring as a result of the work
      schedule that we sometimes have to adhere to.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, given that kind of stress, and given the fact
      that the team is under such strict, strict deadlines, do you find that
      that makes it more difficult for them to get along? Or do you think that
      that's something that brings them together</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-18-0555"></a><a name="idx-CHP-18-0556"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I think that it depends
      on the person, and where you are in the mission timeline.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, frankly, the people that really can't
      handle the stress eventually drop off the team. They either leave for
      another job or they just get reassigned. There's really no room in this
      business for someone who can't do the work. To that extent, I think that
      there's a lot of cooperation and general agreement on how to do
      things.</p>
<p class="docText">As far as the teams go, the teams tend to work pretty well
      together. On the ones that I've been on, there hasn't been too much
      discord. Sometimes there are differences of opinion on how to proceed,
      but generally, once a direction is given, you proceed pretty
      well.</p>
<p class="docText">Where we have gotten into trouble, and this is my personal
      opinion, is reuse. There have been several attempts to produce
      <a name="idx-CHP-18-0557"></a>reusable software architectures that can then be used to
      reduce costs and bring our overall project costs down and make our
      projects more affordable.</p>
<p class="docText">And frankly, I think that the lack of a solid deadline to hit on
      those has contributed to the fact that people tend to disagree more on
      which direction to go in, and they tend to not make as much progress on
      those particular projects.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: That's really interesting. A couple of the other
      people that we've interviewed for this book have also brought up the
      idea that reuse as a goal in and of itself can sometimes actually be an
      obstacle</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yes, I think that's an
      accurate statement.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: The interesting thing to me is that reuse is
      something that people have really touted as a big goal of a lot of
      projects. I've worked with or heard of a lot of teams who designed
      entire software packages to make them reusable, especially over the last
      five or six years. That seemed to be happening
      industrywide</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">In your experience, even with the kind of rigor you guys
      put in, do you run into trouble delivering software that's meant to have
      lots of layers of abstraction, where the goal is to be
      reusable</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I think we do. It's
      something we've been trying to do for 20 years. I'm not sure that we've
      still gotten it right, to be honest.</p>
<p class="docText">What tends to happen is that you get an initiative going to build
      some kind of reusable platform, and it's not just software. It also
      applies to the hardware and the avionics and various components that we
      use.</p>
<p class="docText">Then you get a bunch of smart people together, and those smart
      people tend to not really agree on what the best way to do things is,
      and so they debate and they talk about it and they make some progress.
      But eventually what happens is some project comes along that wants to
      use the system or needs to use the system, and suddenly the system
      becomes dedicated to that project.</p>
<p class="docText">That's when you start to get some progress in terms of getting to
      a real functional system, but it loses its reusability aspects because
      now the project owns the system, and doesn't want to spend project money
      to help the next project out. They need to spend their project money to
      get their project going and to make their project the best that it can
      be.</p>
<p class="docText">It's really a tough nut to crack. I haven't
      seen anybody at JPL successfully complete a <a name="idx-CHP-18-0558"></a>reusable platform yet, to be honest.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think that maybe what happens is that
      once the common, well-understood goal of putting a spacecraft in orbit
      around a planet is gone, the goal becomes more amorphous? Do you think
      that the lack of that clear goal might be making the team less
      cohesive</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yes. And you get into
      philosophical arguments, and once you descend into abstraction&mdash;you could
      think of it as ascending&mdash;but once you get into that abstract level of
      thinking, then it becomes much harder to justify a particular direction
      as the right one.</p>
<p class="docText">Whereas when you've got a concrete goal&mdash;"We've got to put this
      functionality together, and it has to be here by this date, or we're
      going to miss our launch window"&mdash;eventually people fall in line. They
      say, "OK, well, this isn't the way that I would really like to see it
      done, but it's going to work, and it's good enough."</p>
<p class="docText">What you lose is that "good enough" aspect when you're going for
      something reusable. It's natural to do that because you're trying to
      find the best solution and not just the good enough one. But that tends,
      as you said, to be an obstacle to actually accomplishing
      something.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds like you fall right into that
      locking-horns trap that you talked about before, except in this case,
      there's no longer the trump card of, "We have to get the mission out.
      Our launch window is at this date for these three weeks, and if we spend
      the next six months locking horns, we're going to miss our launch
      window." That trump card's gone and the situation just devolves into
      locked horns, into deadlock</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: That's exactly right.
      One of the things that we also suffer from here at JPL, and it's sort of
      unique to the business we're in, is that every one of our missions is
      unique. I've yet to see two missions that are identical or even very
      similar.</p>
<p class="docText">I mean, even if you look at the Mars Pathfinder and the MER and
      the Mars Science Laboratory, which is currently in development, all
      three are Mars rovers. Yet each mission is very unique in the hardware
      that's onboard, in the methods used to arrive on Mars, and in the
      instrument packages that are onboard.</p>
<p class="docText">What you have is a situation where technology outpaces the life
      cycle that we're in. It takes three to five years to get a mission from
      concept to launch. Technology moves at roughly that same rate&mdash;even
      faster, actually, if you look at how quickly computers become
      obsolete.</p>
<p class="docText">We end up with a situation where even if we can agree to develop a
      certain platform using a certain language on a certain piece of
      hardware, by the time we get it ready for the first mission, technology
      has moved ahead. That makes the job even that much harder to actually
      come up with a standard, reusable platform.</p>
<p class="docText">We're still trying, and there are still some
      smart people thinking about it and trying to figure out what to do. And
      perhaps someday, with pluggable architectures, we'll finally come up
      with something that is more universal.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: A question hit me as you were talking about the
      testing team earlier. One of the big tenets of agile development that
      both Andrew and I really like a lot is the responsibility for quality
      that's put on developers, the fact that they're expected to unit-test
      their own code and that through continuous integration, it gets easier
      and easier to monitor changes that are made in code. So I wondered, do
      you guys use any of those techniques</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-18-0559"></a><a name="idx-CHP-18-0560"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I am not aware of
      anybody using agile development here.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Not agile development, per se, but more
      quality-related activities that are done by developers
      themselves</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yes, we do expect our
      developers to unit-test their code before they deliver it for
      integration.</p>
<p class="docText">We tend not to do continuous integration. It's more along the
      lines of everybody gets together, we figure out the requirements and the
      design for the current cycle, we then produce those modules, unit-test
      them, and they come together at once.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I have a question about integration testing.
      What you just said reminded me about when I first read about integration
      in general, back when I was first learning about software
      engineering</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-18-0561"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">If you guys didn't invent the term</span>
      integration <span class="docEmphasis">with respect to software, you certainly were some
      of the first to popularize it back in the '80s and early '90s. For those
      of us purely working on software, where every system in the project is a
      software system, integration just means integrating modules together.
      But I'm assuming that when you say</span> integration,
      <span class="docEmphasis">you're using the larger, original meaning of the word, where
      you're integrating the development of the software and the development
      hardware, too. And if you go back to that meaning, the term unit&mdash;as in
      "unit testing"&mdash;had a specific meaning, too. So, is that what you mean by
      "integration"? Integration of your software with a hardware component
      within the larger system that you're working on</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yes. So, there are two
      levels of integration. We develop independent software modules, or
      units, which are pieces that are small enough that a single person or a
      couple of people can actually get their arms around them and adequately
      implement them and test them.</p>
<p class="docText">Then those come together in our software integration. We put those
      together, and those get linked together, and then we run some software
      integration tests on, say, one of our SoftSim test platforms that I
      mentioned earlier, or perhaps even on a hardware test bed if we have one
      available.</p>
<p class="docText">Then, once the software is integrated and ready to go, it's
      declared ready by the software manager, and it gets sent to the hardware
      test beds for certification. It then goes to the vehicle.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the phases of the mission is called
      ATLO&mdash;Assembly Test and Launch Operations. That's also known as Phase D,
      which is just a letter designation for that particular time in the
      project life cycle. That starts from the delivery of hardware to
      integration on what you could call the factory floor, although we
      attempt to do it in a clean room.</p>
<p class="docText">You start to get hardware together, and the hardware gets
      assembled. Once you have a sufficient critical mass of hardware
      assembled together, you can upload the software onto the avionics
      system, and then you can start to test it out and make sure that a) the
      software correctly commands the hardware, and b) the hardware works
      properly when you command it.</p>
<p class="docText">We test as much as we can on the ground. Typically, that runs
      about 9 to 12 months prior to delivery to the launch site. That's our
      ATLO phase. When a new software build is ready, it goes to the hardware
      test bed, and then it goes to ATLO for integration with the vehicle and
      the testing that occurs there, so we do have several levels of
      integration that occur.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, I guess for somebody who when they first
      heard you say, "We don't do continuous integration" wasn't sure why not,
      that should explain it. I think it's safe to say that if your
      integration process involves a clean room, it probably precludes
      automated integration</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: True. We don't have
      automated integration. Now, I have seen systems at some of our industry
      partners where they will do, for example, a nightly build of everything
      that has been checked into the CM system for that day. The reason they
      do that is to make sure that the whole build system hasn't been upset or
      broken by some changes that were made.</p>
<p class="docText">Then there is a process where at some designated point or when
      everybody says thumbs up, we designate that that particular build is
      ready for integration and it all gets pushed forward in the
      process.</p>
<p class="docText">As I understand continuous integration, I think the way you're
      using it, anybody can basically say, "OK, my module's ready," and just
      stick it in and start to work with it. We really can't do that. It's
      really a much more coordinated effort.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: One of the things that people really like about
      continuous integration or an automated integration process is that it's
      very efficient, and it enforces a certain quality level. People don't
      have to spend a lot of time coordinating with each other to build the
      software, and they can trust that the software does have a certain level
      of quality because they can depend on the system to make sure that it
      builds cleanly, passes its unit tests, etc. Now, you can't do that level
      of automation, for the reasons you just outlined. But are there other
      ways that you make your process more efficient? And are there ways that
      you make sure that the quality of the code is always
      high</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-18-0562"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: What we will do is we
      sometimes run those cycles in parallel, so you'll have build two in
      integration, and build three will be in the design phase. You'll have
      people working on different aspects of the system in different phases of
      the life cycle at the same time.</p>
<p class="docText">Yes, we do expect people to deliver
      <a name="idx-CHP-18-0563"></a>quality, unit-tested code. And not only that, it has to
      adhere to the coding standards. It has to be well commented. They have
      to deliver documentation associated with it that describes what it's
      supposed to do, what problem reports are addressed by the current
      revision, what problem reports are still outstanding. We keep track of
      all the defects that are found in integration and tests, and we have to
      address all of those before launch.</p>
<p class="docText">We also have a <a name="idx-CHP-18-0564"></a>NASA facility called the Independent Verification and
      Validation Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia, that does independent
      audits of our processes and our code and helps us to locate any residual
      issues, defects, requirements, problems.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Like an external SQA group</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yes, exactly like an
      external SQA group. We have independent SQA here at JPL that is not
      reporting through the project management, but reports to our SQA
      organization. Then, on top of that, we have an outside, external SQA,
      which is provided by <a name="idx-CHP-18-0565"></a>NASA.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: It sounds like it's very transparent. People
      write code. They write documentation around that code. They go through
      many levels of review by themselves and then with the team,
      right</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Yes.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Which sounds really great in terms of finding
      defects as early in the process as possible. But one question that I
      have about that is I've noticed in my career that a lot of developers
      get really, really defensive when other people look at their code, or
      even when people have negative comments about code, or find defects,
      even. Do you feel like the culture where you are is different than
      that</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I guess I do. The
      developers that I've worked with have all been fairly responsive to
      having people review their code and point out places where there might
      be problems. In fact, we go through review, a code walkthrough, of every
      module that we put onto our spacecraft.</p>
<p class="docText">There's a certain amount of professional pride, of course. People
      don't like to see their code picked apart, but on the other hand, if
      there really is a problem, I've never known anybody that wasn't willing
      to accept the fact that there was a problem and then fix it. In fact, a
      lot of times they're really happy when you say, "You've got a
      concurrency defect here and you could have a potential deadlock," and
      they say, "Oh, yeah, I guess that's true. We'll have to fix that."
      Haven't had any real problems with that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: And what about the relationship between the
      testers and the developers? Is there a good relationship
      there</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Generally, yes, I think
      there is. In some cases, it's the same person, really. We don't always
      have independent tests. We have independent review of test results. So,
      a developer will do their unit tests. We have a unit-test review, and
      then when we get to integration, it is frequently the same developer
      that is writing the tests for integration and sometimes even executing
      it.</p>
<p class="docText">But we always have a second set of eyes,
      someone from the systems engineering organization or someone from the
      subsystem organization that's responsible for that piece of equipment
      that the software's supposed to operate.</p>
<p class="docText">We always have someone from systems engineering look at the test
      and verify that the software looks like it's doing the right
      thing.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I really can appreciate how careful you guys
      have to be with your quality, and the results speak for themselves in
      the missions you fly</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-18-0566"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">But I can just see some of our readers reading this,
      maybe somebody who's used to being a down-and-dirty developer who has to
      fire things off really rapidly, and often in not the most rigorous
      environment. I could see them getting an interoffice mail package from
      an IV&amp;V group or an SQA group, opening it up, and groaning because
      it's yet another report from someone who I don't even know who's looked
      through all my code and come up with all these problems, these bugs I've
      introduced</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: Well, it's no picnic. It
      really is something of a burden to have to deal with these
      things.</p>
<p class="docText">On Phoenix, there were over 800 technical issue memoranda that
      were generated by the <a name="idx-CHP-18-0567"></a>NASA IV&amp;V group. I had to review every one of those
      technical issue memoranda to ensure that there wasn't anything in there
      that was critical to the health of the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="docText">I think there were roughly half a dozen of those that were
      significant enough that we needed to fix them. There were many of them
      that we caught in our own internal reviews or testing. Then, there were
      some that were what you might categorize as nits where you say, "Yeah,
      you know, I understand what you're saying, but that's not really going
      to be a problem because we're either using it in a different way, our
      use precludes the problem from occurring, or it's just a minor point
      that, geez, stylistically it would look nice, but we're not worried
      about it."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think that if you asked everybody on the
      team to give their honest opinion, would the general consensus be that
      it was worth all of the effort or not worth all of the effort? Are these
      half a dozen defects things that would have actually crashed a spaceship
      into a moon</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: None of them were things
      that we would call mission-critical. That is, we wouldn't have lost the
      mission if we had failed to fix those. But they would have been
      annoying. We might have lost a couple of days on the surface, maybe even
      a week, trying to figure out what happened and get it corrected.</p>
<p class="docText">It's good that we found them. Was it worth the effort? I guess I
      would say, yes, I think it was. It's like eating your vegetables.
      Sometimes you don't want to do it, but you have to because it's good for
      you in the long run.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I think that's very interesting. If you were
      going to plot out software and quality practices on a scale of least
      onerous to most onerous, or from least overhead to most overhead, you
      guys would be at the very end of that scale. And you, the guy who
      actually has to review the memoranda, still feel
      it's worth it. It was worth the time and effort you and your team put
      in, simply based on how much better it made the final
      product</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I think so. If you look
      at Phoenix, we had very, very few problems in flight. I can't think of
      any major or even significant software issues that we had prior to
      landing.</p>
<p class="docText">And post-landing, we had one issue, a problem that was related to
      reuse of a telemetry system that was designed for an orbiter, where it
      wasn't expected that you would be rebooting it frequently.</p>
<p class="docText">On the surface, we shut down and wake up several times a day, and
      there was a counter that wasn't managed quite right. When that counter
      rolled over, we had a problem that caused the spacecraft to go into what
      we call safe mode, a protective mode where it basically shuts all of the
      science down and tries to maintain a good power environment, and
      communicate back to Earth and wait for instructions.</p>
<p class="docText">Fortunately, we were able to identify the cause of that problem
      rather quickly; within about 24 hours, we understood what happened and
      got it corrected within a few days.</p>
<p class="docText">But, really, as spacecraft go, missions that I've been involved
      in, this mission had the least amount of software problems that I can
      remember.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Just one more kind of general question, Peter. Is
      there anything in particular that characterized the best team that
      you've worked on? Something that you want to drop out as a pearl of
      wisdom for readers</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Peter</span>: I think that the best
      teams that I've worked on and worked with have really had a common goal.
      You're working to the same goal and you appreciate each other. You have
      a respect for everyone's skills, and even though somebody's the project
      leader and somebody else might be the chief architect, everybody really
      understands that contributions are being made all around.</p>
<p class="docText">It's funny; the most satisfying projects are not necessarily the
      ones that do the grandest things, but the ones where the team is
      cohesive and everybody is respected for their contributions.</p>
