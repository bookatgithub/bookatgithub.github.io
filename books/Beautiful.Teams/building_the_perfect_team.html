<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Bill DiPierre</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">I CLEARLY REMEMBER THINKING, "MAN, I AM
      OUT OF THE LOOP." I SAT IN A COMPUTECH CONFERENCE</span> room with a
      newly assembled team of high-<a name="idx-CHP-4-0072"></a>powered developers. The task at hand was to port our
      flagship financial software from Microsoft QuickBasic to the promising
      new Microsoft product, Visual Basic 3. As a resident VB guru, I would
      bring technical expertise and hard-earned experience to a project that
      would determine the future of our firm.</p>
<p class="docText">It was hard to believe that only three weeks before, I had
      finished my final day of work at the large commercial bank where I cut
      my programming teeth. Only five weeks before, I'd met Jack, my current
      boss, for the first time. I'd emerged from that interview feeling a
      strong connection with Jack, but also insecure about how well I'd
      impressed him technically. And of course, perhaps hardest to believe, it
      was only six weeks ago that I had plunked down $11.95 at Barnes &amp;
      Noble for a brand-new copy of Bill Sempf's <span class="docEmphasis">Visual Basic for
      Dummies</span> (Wiley).</p>
<p class="docText">In the conference room that day, Geoff and Mark, the two dev leads
      for our team, were debating some fundamental architecture questions.
      Mark laid out his argument, saying, "Look, I know it will be a lot of
      extra work up front, but I don't see any way that we can get the UI
      experience we want if we don't write our own user controls."</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff responded, "You're crazy, Mark. Do you
      realize how much effort that takes? I've been working with C++ a lot
      longer than anyone here, and I'm telling you we are biting off more than
      we can chew."</p>
<p class="docText">Mark was not deterred. "I just don't see how we have a choice. The
      control suite from Microsoft does not do what the design calls
      for."</p>
<p class="docText">"Then the design needs to change."</p>
<p class="docText">"That's not what we're about. We make the technology work to give
      clients what they want. We don't just regurgitate the latest technology
      from Microsoft and tell clients to live with it."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well then, why don't we give them a teleporter? Since we're not
      limited by technology, we might as well help them with their
      commute."</p>
<p class="docText">Sensing that the constructive portion of the debate had come to a
      close, Jack stepped in, saying, "All right, all right. Before we commit
      to building a teleporter, let's back up a step. We need more
      information. You guys are my experts, and I need your expertise right
      now. Geoff, can you put together an estimate of how long it will take to
      do what Mark is proposing?"</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff rolled his eyes and let out a big sigh. "OK, but I can tell
      you right now it's gonna blow our timeline out of the water."</p>
<p class="docText">Jack, unflappable, said, "That's all right. The dates are my
      problem, let me worry about them. You're our C++ man, so I need you to
      put on that hat and tell me what you see."</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff nodded. "OK."</p>
<p class="docText">Turning to Mark, Jack continued. "Mark, please give me a list of
      all the functionality we can get off-the-shelf without doing any custom
      work." Sensing Mark's reaction, Jack pressed on. "In addition to dates,
      I'm also the one to worry about the design requirements. You're going to
      be implementing these babies in Computech, so let me know how far you
      can get with the Microsoft stuff. Don't worry about what design asked
      for, just focus on what you can do with the off-the-shelf tools." Then,
      with an almost imperceptible wink, he added, "And remember: I've seen
      your code, so I know you can do a hell of a lot."</p>
<p class="docText">Mark, unable to resist a half smile at the compliment, said, "OK,
      Jack, I'll see what I can do."</p>
<p class="docText">Most of us remember the 1990s as a heyday for developers, and it
      was. The <a name="idx-CHP-4-0073"></a>tech bubble was in full bloom, and venture capitalists
      were everywhere, looking for people to give their money to. And those
      people were programmers. We've all heard the stories of the
      rock-climbing walls and $10,000 coffee tables. The things that made it
      all go were the programmers. They were in demand, they could name their
      price&mdash;even if their price was a rock-climbing wall and an extremely
      expensive coffee table.</p>
<p class="docText">In the Computech conference room that day, the
      rise and fall of the tech bubble was still in the future. It was the
      early '90s, there were indications that software was a pretty good way
      to make a living, but none of us had any idea just how good. The demand
      for developers would quickly outstrip the supply, and turnover
      industrywide would reach record levels. Ten years later, I would look
      around the Computech conference table and see the same faces I had seen
      before the frenzy began. That is a testament to team solidarity. Not one
      of us had been lured away by rock walls or coffee tables. Actually,
      that's not quite true; Doug did leave, but he doesn't really count. He
      went on tour with the rock band he managed. I'll get to that
      later.</p>
<p class="docText">As a business, Computech was well positioned to offer a
      competitive product to a niche of consumers eager to get it and willing
      to pay for it. That's a great position to be in. As a technology,
      Computech was running up against serious limitations. It was written
      with QuickBasic and was designed to run on a single machine featuring
      DOS. As computer networking began to grow in the financial business
      sector, more and more clients were migrating their infrastructures to
      Windows. They wanted a Windows version of Computech. And we wanted to
      give it to them. Expanded network support, more robust memory
      management, and better development tools were just a few of the reasons
      Computech was determined to make this transition. Not to mention a whole
      new world of interface possibilities. Hey, we could use a mouse!</p>
<p class="docText">So there we sat. We had a reliable but limited DOS application. We
      had consumer demand for a Windows version. And we had a team of seven
      guys who needed to take the former and turn it into the latter. What a
      great project. It was big, it was complex, it was vital, and it was
      time-limited. Our need to retain a hard-won customer base meant our
      margin for error was small. The upside at the time seemed unlimited;
      this project would carry Computech into the future. It was a classic
      software team project.</p>
<p class="docText">Of course, if our two dev leads could not get along, we were in
      for a bumpy ride. After the meeting, my top priority, unofficially, was
      to try to get a handle on how this <a name="idx-CHP-4-0074"></a>power struggle would resolve. In an attempt to get some
      impartial insight, I went to someone who wasn't directly
      involved.</p>
<p class="docText">"Doug, what's up?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Yo, Bill, how's the first month treating you?"</p>
<p class="docText">"So far so good, man. Meetings like that keep it
      interesting."</p>
<p class="docText">Doug seemed kind of surprised. "Yeah, I guess so."</p>
<p class="docText">Well, that was a non-starter. I tried a more direct approach. "So
      what do you think, we gonna write all this stuff from scratch in
      C++?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Huh? Oh yeah, I don't know. Jack'll figure it out. Probably do
      some of them and see how it goes."</p>
<p class="docText">Obviously, the teleporter debate did not leave
      much of an impression on Doug. I pressed on, saying, "Really, why do you
      say that?"</p>
<p class="docText">Doug shrugged. "I don't know, just seems like what he'll do. He's
      pretty mellow and he usually will try something out and see what
      happens."</p>
<p class="docText">All well and good, but I wasn't getting much sense of how the
      <a name="idx-CHP-4-0075"></a>office <a name="idx-CHP-4-0076"></a>politics factored in. Doug, for his part, seemed oblivious
      to them. In retrospect, perhaps Doug was not the ideal person to shed
      light on these dynamics. Doug was not a programmer by choice; he was a
      programmer by necessity. Programming paid the bills during the gestation
      of his real career: rock-and-roll entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="docText">Doug had been writing code since his teens. He started using the
      MIDI package on his Macintosh Plus (featuring, of course, the fully
      expanded 4 MB of RAM) to create records in his parents' garage. By age
      27, he'd traded in the Mac for a Yamaha mixing board. His records were
      now circulated to non-family members. He also served as manager for an
      actual band. Doug spent most of his time consumed with music and was
      preposterously inept at downplaying this detail during job interviews.
      What most potential employers saw as a liability, Jack saw as an asset.
      Here was a kid who could bring strong technical skills without rattling
      the hierarchy. Doug wasn't looking to move up the company ladder or
      leave his mark on the software world. Doug was looking to pay his rent
      until his band hit it big.</p>
<p class="docText">That was great for our team; Doug produced a lot of code. It
      wasn't helping me get in the loop, though. A couple of days later, I was
      working with Geoff. I'd approached him for assistance understanding some
      old C++ code that needed to be ported. He was a big help. The code
      contained several optimizations that I didn't understand, but the
      rationale behind them was clear to Geoff. I was impressed, and told him
      so. "Geoff, that's pretty impressive. It would have taken me the better
      part of a week to figure out what we just covered in an hour."</p>
<p class="docText">He was almost gracious, responding, "Yeah, well, I've been writing
      C and C++ code for a long time. Some things start to become second
      nature."</p>
<p class="docText">"Yeah, I suppose. Anyway, I appreciate the help."</p>
<p class="docText">"No problem. Let me know if you need more."</p>
<p class="docText">That was encouraging&mdash;sincerity instead of sarcasm. I decided to
      press on. "Thanks, man, I will. Hey, so what's up with our UI controls?
      Have you spoken to Jack?"</p>
<p class="docText">"No, I haven't had a chance, but I will. It's a big
      mistake."</p>
<p class="docText">"Really? Seems to me like Jack is taking a reasonable approach,
      looking at his options."</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff shrugged, unimpressed. "Jack's problem is that he thinks
      Mark can do anything and it just isn't true."</p>
<p class="docText">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I mean Mark is the main UI architect and
      that's fine. But he doesn't have half the C experience I do, so when it
      comes to a project like this he's in over his head. I don't think Jack
      sees that."</p>
<p class="docText">"Yeah, maybe. Maybe Jack just thinks it's worth the risk."</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff was moving from unimpressed to irritated. He fidgeted in his
      chair, saying, "Look, you're a VB guy and you just said you couldn't
      figure out this stuff without me. It's freakin' complicated. I mean, I
      can do it, but I've been at it a long time. It's crazy to add this onto
      the pile of work we already have when there's a solution out there that
      will do 99% of what we need."</p>
<p class="docText">I never said I couldn't do it without him, I only said it would
      have taken me longer. I let that slide. I really wanted to understand
      Geoff's beef with Mark, so I decided to avoid the personal slight and
      stick with statistics. Trying to maintain a tone of impartiality, I
      said, "Well, yeah, but the point is it won't do 99%. I think we're
      talking more like 59%."</p>
<p class="docText">"Whatever; it's still gonna be a big improvement over what clients
      have now."</p>
<p class="docText">I went with the loyal soldier argument. "Well, Jack said he'd take
      care of it, so I suppose we should let him worry about that."</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff found this unpersuasive. "Jack can worry about it if he
      wants to, but if he thinks Mark can just hop in and start cranking out
      C++ code, he's making a big mistake."</p>
<p class="docText">Somebody was getting cranky. I stuck with what I thought was the
      logical response. "I'm not sure, Geoff. From what I've seen, Mark seems
      like a pretty sharp developer."</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure, Mark can write code. He's good at what he's good at, but
      this is asking a lot of him."</p>
<p class="docText">Yeah, Geoff definitely was touchy about Mark. I couldn't resist
      asking. "Why? I mean code is code. Mark is a smart guy."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, <span class="docEmphasis">smart</span> is a relative term."</p>
<p class="docText">At this point, Geoff leaned over to one side and reached into his
      back pocket, extracting his wallet. He dug around for a second, and then
      removed a carefully laminated card, which he handed to me. Turns out,
      Geoff was a card-carrying member of Mensa&mdash;literally,
      card-carrying.</p>
<p class="docText">OK, well that was quite a transformation&mdash;from sincere and helpful
      to complete horse's ass in about six minutes. I was fairly stunned, but
      I managed to mutter, "Well, that's impressive, but I still wonder if
      you're underestimating Mark."</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff shrugged, adding, without conviction, "Hmmm. Yeah, maybe.
      We'll see."</p>
<p class="docText">So the guy can write C++ code blindfolded, but he's got some
      serious limitations in the team player department. Clearly, Geoff
      thought Jack deferred to Mark, and it bothered him. I'd worked on enough
      projects to know the signs of someone who's about to go off the rails.
      This one was barreling along at full speed, and the bridge ahead was
      out.</p>
<p class="docText">The next morning I was sipping my coffee on my
      way past Mark's office and I popped in to see what he was working on.
      I'd fallen into the habit of doing this fairly regularly to help me get
      up to speed on our software. On this particular day, we were discussing
      the eventing model Mark had devised for our app. The early versions of
      Visual Basic did not allow public methods on forms, which made it
      cumbersome to manage MDI apps. Mark had come up with an ingenious and
      simple workaround, using the tag property of a hidden button to simulate
      raising events on child forms. It was fairly elegant, was easy to use,
      and did exactly what we needed&mdash;a typical Mark solution.</p>
<p class="docText">Mark and I were quickly building a nice working rapport. As a
      developer, he was more accomplished than I, but we tended to approach
      programming problems from a similar perspective. I agreed with his
      assertion earlier that our primary focus had to be on client needs, not
      technology. I wondered what he thought of Geoff's resistance.</p>
<p class="docText">"So Mark, how's the survey of the Microsoft stuff coming? Do you
      think we'll be able to avoid rolling our own?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Not without sacrificing some design requirements. Geoff is way
      too uptight about this. It would be cool to write our own controls,
      don't you think?"</p>
<p class="docText">Honestly, our personal enjoyment had never entered my mind as a
      viable factor in making the decision. Of course, as a developer, I could
      hardly disagree&mdash;it would be a great project. Still, I tried to put
      myself in Jack's shoes, saying, "Yeah, it'd be fun. But I'm not sure
      that's at the top of Jack's priority list right now."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, he should keep it in mind. Keeping us happy is half the
      battle, right?" I couldn't tell if his grin was conspiratorial or
      sarcastic. Mark continued, "Anyway, Geoff acts like he's the only person
      on earth who can write C code. Give me a break. We'll definitely get
      enough benefits out of writing our own to justify it. It won't take that
      much longer."</p>
<p class="docText">Danger, bridge out ahead. "Well, if it won't take that much
      longer, then it's an easy decision. I guess that's why Jack is trying to
      quantify it."</p>
<p class="docText">As if on cue, Jack appeared, asking, "What am I trying to
      quantify?" As a manager, Jack was extremely accessible. He often took
      the initiative to walk around the office and drop in on people. His
      chats were always informal, and often had nothing (directly) to do with
      work. Today, however, he'd walked right into the middle of a work
      conversation.</p>
<p class="docText">I answered his question first. "Oh, I was just asking Mark about
      the UI controls and how much longer it would take to do our own."</p>
<p class="docText">Jack nodded, pointed at Mark, and said, "Oh good, I wanted to talk
      to you about that. I don't have time right now; let's do it tomorrow
      morning at our 10 o'clock."</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure."</p>
<p class="docText">Then Jack turned to me and added, "Bill, why don't you stop by,
      too. I'd like for you to be in on this discussion."</p>
<p class="docText">"OK, Jack."</p>
<p class="docText">"Great, see you guys tomorrow at 10." With that, he strolled out
      and down the hall. I looked at Mark, but couldn't read his expression. I
      offered, "Well, guess we'll have an answer soon enough."</p>
<p class="docText">"Yep. I sure hope it's the right one."</p>
<p class="docText">I hoped so, too, but I couldn't worry about it at the moment. I
      had problems of my own to deal with. Part of my role at Computech was
      managerial, and as such I had a single developer reporting to me. Bob
      had been with Computech for seven or eight years. When I first came on
      board I remember wondering why someone with his tenure was reporting to
      me and not the other way around. My confusion soon cleared up.</p>
<p class="docText">One of our tech guys came into my office and told me that all the
      color toner had been drained from our new LaserJet by Bob only one day
      after the cartridges were replaced. The tech was understandably upset:
      the toner was new, it was expensive, and it was on back order.
      Furthermore, he implied that Bob had wasted the toner, but would not
      elaborate. As Bob's manager, it fell to me to unravel the mystery of
      Tonergate.</p>
<p class="docText">I stopped by Bob's cube. After catching up on some dev issues, I
      got to the real point of my visit. "So Bob, have you been printing a lot
      of stuff? Our LaserJet has run through a whole color toner cartridge
      since yesterday."</p>
<p class="docText">Bob certainly had his faults, but dishonesty was not one of them.
      As such, he answered, "Yes."</p>
<p class="docText">Clearly, loquaciousness was not one of them, either. I prodded:
      "Why? Why do you need to print so much stuff?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I was printing menus for my girlfriend's new Thai place.
      Remember, I gave you one of her cards?"</p>
<p class="docText">I did indeed remember Bob giving me a business card when he
      recently described to me his new girlfriend and her new business
      venture. What I did not recall was any mention of Computech making
      material contributions to that start-up. "Uh yeah, sure, I remember
      that. But why are you printing the menus here?"</p>
<p class="docText">"It would cost us a fortune to print them at Kinko's."</p>
<p class="docText">Typically logical; Bob was nothing if not logical. He was a little
      weaker in other areas, like social convention or understanding implied
      things that are obvious to everyone else. "Right, Bob, but you can't
      crank them out here at the office just because you don't want to pay for
      them."</p>
<p class="docText">"Why not? I thought we were allowed to use the printer for
      personal items."</p>
<p class="docText">"What makes you say that?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, last week Mark printed out a picture of his
      daughter."</p>
<p class="docText">"But that's just one picture. You wiped out
      the printer. No one in the office can use it for a week while we wait
      for toner."</p>
<p class="docText">"I didn't know I would wipe it out."</p>
<p class="docText">"But you did. You can't print that much stuff."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, if there's a limit for personal items, you need to tell me
      what it is."</p>
<p class="docText">By now I was aggravated. "Until further notice, your limit is
      zero."</p>
<p class="docText">Now it was Bob's turn to be aggravated. "But that's not fair. Why
      should I have a different limit than everybody else?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Because everybody's different, Bob. Everything is not
      automatically the same for everyone."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, that's bogus. I'm gonna talk to Jack about that."</p>
<p class="docText">I sighed. "Fine. I'll talk to him, too."</p>
<p class="docText">"Fine," said Bob, as he turned back to his monitor.</p>
<p class="docText">That had turned into a mess. Bob was by no means a superstar
      developer. And obviously, he could be <a name="idx-CHP-4-0077"></a>difficult to work with. But we needed his contribution to
      make our dates, and as the new guy I did not feel great about alienating
      him. As a manager, my job was to pull the team together, not split it
      apart. I walked back to my office, replaying the scene in my head,
      wondering if I could have handled it differently. I didn't really see
      another way to play it, but that didn't reduce my anxiety over what Jack
      might have to say about how I'd handled Bob.</p>
<p class="docText">Luckily, dwelling on my anxiety was not an option, because I had
      my Wednesday 11 a.m. to get to. Most of the team would be at this weekly
      status meeting. Normally it was fairly uneventful, but given the tension
      between Mark and Geoff, and now Bob and me, I entered with some
      trepidation. I planned to sit next to Doug, thinking that if fireworks
      started going he would most likely be out of the fray. As soon as I took
      my seat I regretted my decision. One look at Doug and I could tell he
      was wrapped up tight. He licked his lips and fidgeted around, drumming
      his fingers on the table. His eyes darted around the room. I braced
      myself. If most of the people in the room, including me, were already on
      edge, then this meeting could quickly turn ugly.</p>
<p class="docText">Doug started out, still fidgeting around in his chair. "All right,
      I just need to clear the air because I'm having a hard time
      concentrating with what's going on."</p>
<p class="docText">Here we go. I looked around to check reactions. Everyone looked a
      little surprised. No telling who would be the target of this
      diatribe.</p>
<p class="docText">Doug continued. "I'm having a hard time today because last night
      we had a church gig and our lead singer dropped the f-bomb."</p>
<p class="docText">The sound of a chuckle being stifled was clearly discernable. I
      put a hand over my mouth, attempting to cover a smile. Doug, apparently
      unaware that we did not share his distress, went on
      to describe in some detail the career ramifications of this
      inconceivably careless faux pas. I looked over at Jack who, like the
      rest of us, was halfheartedly trying to suppress a grin. At the time, I
      was unaware that Jack had taken a risk by knowingly hiring a guy with
      long-term plans that did not include Computech. Thinking back on it, I
      wonder if part of Jack's grin came from realizing how big the return on
      that gamble turned out to be.</p>
<p class="docText">A couple of hours later, I was working through some code in my
      office when my phone rang. I picked it up. "Hello, this is Bill."</p>
<p class="docText">"Hey, Bill, it's Jack, you got a minute?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure Jack, what's up?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Can you swing by my office? Bob is here and I want to talk about
      this printer thing."</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure, I'll be right there."</p>
<p class="docText">I remember thinking "crap" as soon as I hung up. I should have
      made a point of getting to Jack and telling him my side of the story.
      Instead, I'd put it off and now Bob was in there lobbying. Jack and Bob
      had a working relationship that spanned the better part of a decade.
      Jack and I, on the other hand, were still in our first month.</p>
<p class="docText">As I crossed the threshold of Jack's doorway, he looked up from
      behind his desk and said, "Hey, Bill, thanks for coming." Gesturing
      vaguely with his hand, he added, "Have a seat." Bob already occupied one
      of the two seats in front of Jack's desk, so I took the other. As I sat,
      I nodded, greeting him with "Hey, Bob."</p>
<p class="docText">Not wanting to be out-matured by me, he responded tightly: "Hi,
      Bill."</p>
<p class="docText">So much for the small talk. Jack didn't waste any time, getting
      right to the point. "OK, Bill, so I've been chatting with Bob about this
      printer thing for a few minutes. He thinks you're unfairly restricting
      him."</p>
<p class="docText">I'd been thinking off and on all morning about the best way to
      present my case. Ultimately, I'd decided that the facts spoke for
      themselves. In another environment, I may have tried to be more
      political. At Computech, to my well-documented dismay, I was out of the
      loop, so it was hard to play politics. As such, I recounted what had
      happened earlier, pretty much without embellishment. When I was done, I
      added, "I also learned that for these menus, Bob used up four reams of
      paper. I know we've got plenty of paper around, but it just seems like,
      on principle, this is excessive."</p>
<p class="docText">Bob was ready for this one, responding, "Well, since I've been
      working here I always make a point of reusing my printer paper. So after
      I print on one side, I reload it all and print on the other side, and I
      know I'm the only one here who does that. I haven't calculated it
      exactly, but I estimate I've saved Computech at least 10 reams of paper
      in the past six years."</p>
<p class="docText">I'm not sure, but I think that my jaw visibly dropped. There was
      no way Jack could go for this, could he? It was just too ridiculous. But
      it did have an inherent logic, and Bob had been working here for a long
      time. I could only assume his attitude was not a surprise to Jack.
      Was it possible that Jack condoned it? I squeezed the armrests of my
      chair as Jack started to speak.</p>
<p class="docText">"Sorry, Bob, I'm with Bill on this one."</p>
<p class="docText">I let out the breath I'd unconsciously held in and relaxed my
      grip. Bob started to object, but Jack cut him off. "No one else has this
      problem. Everyone but you seems to understand the implied limits. You
      asked for a limit, and you got one, so live with it."</p>
<p class="docText">Bob wasn't going without a protest. "That's bogus. It's not
      fair."</p>
<p class="docText">Jack responded with a phrase I would hear him use many times over
      the years: "If life was fair, there wouldn't be rich people." It was
      kind of an odd phrase, considering most of our clients were Wall Street
      financiers, but it got his point across and effectively ended the
      protest.</p>
<p class="docText">That was pretty much the end of our meeting. Later that day, I
      popped in to thank Jack for supporting me. He responded, smiling warmly:
      "Hey, don't mention it. I know Bob can be a handful. You did what you
      had to do."</p>
<p class="docText">I asked, "So, you give the handful to the new guy to get him out
      of everybody else's hair?"</p>
<p class="docText">Jack grinned. "Or maybe I give him to the new guy to see how the
      new guy handles him."</p>
<p class="docText">Now it was my turn to grin. "So, how'd I do?"</p>
<p class="docText">"You passed."</p>
<p class="docText">Over the years, I've often wondered about Bob and why Jack kept
      him on board. Sure, he was a handy litmus test for new managers, but
      that hardly justified his salary. So, what was Bob's saving grace? What
      was the one trait that made him a crucial cog in our well-oiled machine?
      Was it his mediocre code? His abrasive personality, perhaps? All of the
      above? I think the answer is none of the above. Bob was not a crucial
      cog. The biggest thing Bob had going for him was that he was part of our
      team. Bob consumed a big chunk of Jack's time, and Jack never blinked.
      Jack was there to support us, to facilitate our work. That was the
      message he sent to Bob, and that was the message he sent to our
      team.</p>
<p class="docText">I talked earlier about the <a name="idx-CHP-4-0078"></a>loyalty Computech engendered. It doesn't come from
      executive emails or dinners on the company dime. <a name="idx-CHP-4-0079"></a>Loyalty is a two-way street. If a manager is committed to
      working with his most <a name="idx-CHP-4-0080"></a>difficult employee, what message does that send to
      everyone else on his team? I remember years later, after Computech had
      been bought, and then its new corporate parent had itself been bought by
      a competitor, we went through a round of layoffs. The layoffs ended in
      December, and by the following February we were hearing from our new
      management about building employee pride and boosting morale. Pretty
      typical stuff in the world of corporate mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p class="docText">I thought about Bob, who was released in the pursuit of
      efficiency. In a way, I was glad to be rid of him. Man, he was
      difficult. It was hard to argue the business case for letting him go. Or
      was it? Those daily morale-boosting emails we received were widely
      derided, considered transparent ploys to keep us
      docile and productive. Resumes were drafted, production diminished.
      Morale was low. And I thought about what would happen if Jack sent a
      similar email, asking us to buckle down for the good of Computech. I
      think we would have believed him, and done what he asked. We would have
      sacrificed for him, because we knew he would do it for us if we needed
      it. And that's what Bob brought to our team: proof that we really were
      committed to teamwork. He was, perhaps, Jack's most visible vehicle for
      showing that we were all in this thing together.</p>
<p class="docText">The next morning, I dropped into Mark's office a little later than
      usual. After discussing a few technical issues with the new build, we
      made our way down to see Jack. As Jack welcomed us into his office, we
      settled into our usual seats and began chatting about the Eagles. Jack
      was a huge Randall Cunningham fan; Mark and I thought his best years
      were behind him. That conversation (which he had several times a week)
      ran out of inertia and Jack switched to the topic at hand.</p>
<p class="docText">"All righty, well, let's talk about this UI stuff. Mark, what do
      you think? How much can the Microsoft stuff do for us?"</p>
<p class="docText">Mark responded: "Yeah, I've been looking at it for a few days and
      it looks like it's gonna be somewhere between one-half and two-thirds of
      the requirements we've been asked to do." He went into a brief
      description of the functionality that we would not be able to implement.
      Jack responded with some specific questions about which design
      requirements would and would not be preserved. Mark had a good handle on
      the scope of the work, and addressed each question. After a few minutes,
      it seemed quite clear to me that the Microsoft controls would handle at
      least two-thirds of our requirements, and probably more like 75% or
      80%.</p>
<p class="docText">If Jack noticed this discrepancy, he didn't acknowledge it.
      Instead, he said to Mark, "OK, what I'd like to do is take one control
      and write it from scratch as a pilot. We can see how it goes, and then
      make a decision on the rest of them." The logic of this as a managerial
      decision was clear. In fact, I had the distinct impression that Jack had
      made that decision before we ever walked into his office that
      morning.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't know if Mark had the same impression, but I do know he was
      pleased with the decision. "Cool. Which one should we do?"</p>
<p class="docText">That was an easy one. Makes sense to do the simplest one first,
      eliminate complications from your pilot. My guess would be the button
      control. Jack, however, screwed up his face as though this detail had
      never occurred to him. He asked, "I don't know, which one do you want to
      do?"</p>
<p class="docText">Mark beamed. "I think the virtual listbox would be a good one to
      start with. It's complex, but we'll be able to use it everywhere, so we
      get the most bang for the buck." He paused for a second, and then added,
      "Plus, it'll be a fun one to write."</p>
<p class="docText">Jack couldn't resist a grin at Mark's enthusiasm. "OK. Virtual
      listbox it is. Can you give me a dev estimate by the end of day
      tomorrow? Also, I really need you to work with Geoff on this
      one." Mark's expression turned dour. Jack continued, "Don't worry, I'll
      talk to him. But we need to take advantage of what he can do if we're
      gonna be able to deliver these in a reasonable time. Otherwise, we'll be
      stuck with the Microsoft stuff."</p>
<p class="docText">The three of us chatted for a few more minutes. After we'd left
      Jack's office, I turned to Mark and said, "That's great, man, you get to
      do the V-List."</p>
<p class="docText">Mark was back to beaming. His face turned serious and he said,
      "Yeah, and I'm really gonna nail it so he lets me do the rest of
      them."</p>
<p class="docText">Of course, Mark was only half of the equation. Geoff's cooperation
      was critical. Jack really needed to work some more magic. Later that
      day, Jack caught up with Geoff for a face-to-face chat. When an ego
      needed <a name="idx-CHP-4-0081"></a>soothing, Jack preferred the one-on-one format. As such, I
      wasn't in Jack's office for this particular session, but having talked
      to Jack about it later and also seeing firsthand how he operates, I can
      pretty fairly reconstruct it. It started with Jack playing into Geoff's
      ego, making him feel like his opinion mattered, saying something like,
      "Geoff, thanks for stopping by. I just wanted to pick your brain a
      little more about these UI controls. What's your feeling on the work
      required to get them done?"</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff, still on the defensive, replied, "Well, like I said, I
      think it's gonna be a lot of extra work. I'd estimate at least three
      months." He paused to maximize the effect of this shocking news. Jack,
      unflappable as always, nodded acceptingly, so Geoff continued: "And I
      don't really see the point. We don't get that much benefit for the extra
      dev time."</p>
<p class="docText">Jack tried to diffuse Geoff's stated objection. "Yeah, I hear you.
      Let's not worry about the dev time for now. I'm more interested in the
      feasibility." Then he went after Geoff's primary, if unstated,
      objection. "The thing is, I think this would be a good learning
      experience for the team, particularly for Mark. We both know he's a good
      programmer, but you are my top C++ guy. And I think it would make the
      whole team stronger if we could take your skills and spread them around
      to the other guys."</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff, somewhat disarmed, replied, "Well, sure, it's always good
      to have critical knowledge shared among the team, but I'm not sure this
      is the time to do it."</p>
<p class="docText">Here, Jack could call on his own experience. "Well, the thing is,
      there's never a good time to do it. I've never been on a project where
      there was extra time to devote to <a name="idx-CHP-4-0082"></a>training. However, I've learned that squeezing the
      training in there almost always pays for itself before the project is
      over."</p>
<p class="docText">Geoff, feeling secure about his own skill set, was willing to cede
      to Jack's expertise on project management. "OK. If you think the delay
      is OK, then that's your call."</p>
<p class="docText">With Geoff more open to the change of plans, Jack went after his
      complete buy-in. "Yes, it's my call. You don't need to sweat that. What
      I do need you to sweat is helping out Mark when he needs it. Like I
      said, we need to spread your knowledge. What do you think?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I mean, I'm OK with it, Jack. I'm just not
      sure how effective it will be."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, how about this? I'll set up an hour a week for you two to
      get together around this stuff, at least to get the ball rolling. Let's
      try that for a couple of weeks and see what happens. And try to be
      patient with Mark; he's used to knowing more than the other guys, so it
      can be hard for him talking C++ with you."</p>
<p class="docText">Jack had hit the right buttons. Geoff beamed and nodded OK.</p>
<p class="docText">"Thanks, Geoff, I appreciate it."</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure, no problem."</p>
<p class="docText">A few days later, the first of these meetings took place. Mark and
      Geoff started out with a weekly meeting to write a listbox in C++. At
      the peak of the project frenzy, they were having three or four impromptu
      meetings per week as they wrapped up the listbox and moved on to
      buttons, text boxes, and a few others, totaling half a dozen custom user
      controls by the time this project wrapped up. Geoff's prediction of a
      three-month delay turned out to be overstated by two months, mostly
      because the experience writing them made each successive one go faster
      and the knowledge that was passed from Geoff to Mark continued its
      dissemination to the rest of the team.</p>
<p class="docText">As for me, the budding VB guru, in retrospect I can see that my
      worries about not being plugged in were misplaced. I actually had a
      pretty good handle on the dynamics of our team. Yes, that's right, there
      was no loop. I had inklings of this early on, but it took me the better
      part of a year to fully accept it. Sure, it sounds nice. A team focused
      on their work; supporting each other in pursuit of a single goal. Yes,
      it really happened. Not necessarily the 10 best programmers who ever
      worked together. Instead, each of us brought something to the table. We
      each had something to contribute, guided deftly by a leader sensitive to
      people, aware of their strengths, and accepting of their flaws.</p>
<p class="docText">So, you've probably guessed by now that the Computech rewrite from
      QuickBasic to Visual Basic 3 was a resounding success. Indeed, it was.
      We had our bumps along the way. Turns out Doug did hit it big. Well,
      biggish. His band went on a U.S. tour. Luckily, it was toward the end of
      the project, so when he left we already had people lined up to fill in
      for him. Bob caused his share of friction, and some of his features did
      not make it into the first Windows release. But these were minor flaws
      in an otherwise overwhelming success.</p>
<p class="docText">Ten months after that day in the conference room, Computech's
      early adopters began receiving a Windows version of our software.
      Feedback was almost unanimously positive, reports of problems were
      minimal, sales skyrocketed, and executives were happy. The development
      team received its share of accolades. Even to this day I'll occasionally
      reminisce with an old Computech veteran, and they'll point out how lucky
      we were to get so many fantastic developers at the same time for a
      single project. I always respond that it wasn't luck and it wasn't
      fantastic developers; it was a beautiful team.</p>
