<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">LittleBigPlanet</span> has been one of the most
        hotly anticipated games of 2008 for the PlayStation 3, and by all
        accounts it's one of the best games of the year. Not only is it a
        ridiculously addictive platformer, but it's also a creative tool that
        lets gamers build and share their own levels. The combination of great
        game play and social networking is a winner for the game's creator,
        <a name="idx-CHP-3-0041"></a>Media Molecule, which was founded a few years ago by
        Mark Healey. We wanted to know what it was like working on a game like
        this, so we sat down with Mark.<a name="idx-CHP-3-0042"></a></p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Jenny's been utterly
      addicted to</span> LittleBigPlanet, <span class="docEmphasis">and I love it. You
      guys just did a phenomenal job</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Well, thank you very
      much. I've actually been quite addicted to it myself.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: It's a great game. It really, really is. That's
      what made us want to talk to you. We wanted to hear the story behind how
      this game came about. Since this book is really focused on teams and how
      they come about, we'd love to kind of hear the story of how you guys
      came together to build this</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: OK, let me think. I'm
      going to have to use my memory, which is normally a bit of a disaster
      &#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">The company was founded by me, Alex Evans, Dave Smith, and Kareem
      Ettouney, with a lot of help from a guy called Chris Lee, who's the
      business-minded person.</p>
<p class="docText">Apart from Chris, all of us had worked together and been friends
      at our previous company, Lionhead Studios.</p>
<p class="docText">We were always working together on various things, and one day I
      decided that I was going to make a silly kung fu film over a weekend,
      for no other reason than to have a laugh, really. So I borrowed a
      <a name="idx-CHP-3-0043"></a>video camera from Lionhead and we spent about &#163;50 on some
      costumes and things. We went into the park behind my house and made an
      incredibly stupid kung fu film, without a script or plan; we didn't know
      who was going to turn up, so we just winged it on the day. I then
      started editing it and making it into a little film&mdash;at the same time, I
      was teaching myself to program C++, because I actually used to work as a
      programmer in the industry many, many years ago, before I became an
      artist. Back then I used assembler (6510), but chose to concentrate more
      on art because it's less of a headache.</p>
<p class="docText">So I was making this film and learning C++, when I put two and two
      together and I thought, "OK. Well, if I'm going to learn C++ I need to
      have a little project, so I'll make a simple little fighting game, a bit
      like <span class="docEmphasis">Street Fighter</span>, and use the kung fu film as
      cut scenes." So that was what became <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll Kung
      Fu</span>, a little indie game that eventually became the first
      third-party game released by Valve over their digital distribution
      engine, Steam. It was before Media Molecule was ever thought
      about.<a name="idx-CHP-3-0044"></a></p>
<p class="docText">I was working on that in my spare time, and because I knew Alex
      and Dave, I would often rope them into helping me with some of the more
      complicated stuff I needed help on. Programming is one thing, but
      programming a PC is a whole world of pain. It just seems incredibly
      complicated to me; reading Direct X documentation is ridiculous&mdash;every
      other word is a link to another page! Luckily for me, Alex and Dave are
      very brainy and technical, and can do things in 10 minutes that would
      take me 10 years &#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">I had met Kareem a couple of days before I asked him to come join
      in the kung fu fun in the park&mdash;we soon became the best of friends, and
      he ended up being involved with lots of <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll Kung
      Fu</span>: he starred as the evil boss in the filming, helped out
      with some of the art, we made the music together on
      a four-track in my front room, and we even sat down and dubbed over
      ridiculous voices with another friend of mine, Barry, whose girlfriend,
      Siobhan, would later become a vital addition to the Media Molecule team
      as we started to grow, as executive producer.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">A screenshot from Rag Doll Kung Fu, the game that first
      brought the team together.</span></p>
<p class="docText">So you see, we formed an ad hoc team through <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll
      Kung Fu</span>. And in terms of indie <a name="idx-CHP-3-0045"></a>games, it was quite successful, really. It got a lot of
      attention for a game of its size, and more importantly gave us a taste
      for doing something bigger. We've always worked for other companies, and
      doing that small indie game ended up being a crash course, if you like,
      in the whole process from design through to production, through to
      localization and publishing &#8230;.<a name="idx-CHP-3-0046"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew</span>: So Rag Doll Kung Fu <span class="docEmphasis">was the
      project where it all started for you</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll Kung
      Fu</span> brought us together as a team. Then, through a friend of a
      friend, we got in touch with Chris, who has past experience running
      businesses (he ran Renderware) and he told us X, Y, and Z, things that
      we need to think about, things that we need to do. It just so happened
      that within a very short space of time, through a mutual friend, we got
      the opportunity to pitch to Phil Harrison&mdash;he was the man at Sony at the
      time&mdash;but the catch was we didn't have long to prepare! It was exactly in
      one week that this meeting would happen. We had nothing to show, so we
      had to put together an idea very quickly!</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Mark in a live-action cut scene from Rag Doll Kung
      Fu.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That had to be a rush&mdash;in
      every sense of the word</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-3-0047"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: It was very exciting, and
      I suppose it was <a name="idx-CHP-3-0048"></a>stressful. But we always thrived off that in the past, you
      know, when we're given a tight deadline.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Is that something that brought you guys together
      when you'd worked together at Lionhead</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Yeah. I mean, I think
      certainly towards the end of our time at Lionhead, people like me, Alex,
      Kareem, and Dave were quite often brought in to resolve some problems,
      but when we weren't firefighting, we had free rein to do what we wanted,
      really. We were put in a room and just told to make something cool. R
      &amp;D is the technical term for that, I believe.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you thrive in that kind of environment?
      Because a lot of people would find that sort of lack of direction almost
      intimidating, and definitely hard to work in</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: I love that personally,
      but obviously it requires a certain amount of self-motivation. You have
      to come up with at least a rough plan or idea for where you want to
      head; otherwise, it's easy to sit down and just twiddle your thumbs or
      surf the Net. We were working on a project called <span class="docEmphasis">The
      Room</span>. I think there might be a <a name="idx-CHP-3-0049"></a>video of it somewhere on the Internet.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, other than the three of you, how many are
      there on the team at Media Molecule</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-3-0050"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Well, now we're about 30
      people.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: And did it take that many
      people to build the first version of</span> LittleBigPlanet?
      <span class="docEmphasis">How did you plan for the project</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: When we knew that we were
      going to do this pitch for Phil Harrison, we talked roughly about what
      we all wanted to be doing. The ideas were very blue sky, really, and
      slightly vague, so one of our main strategies for the pitch was to pitch
      ourselves as being incredibly creative and skillful, and that if Sony
      gave us some cash, then surely we'd make something awesome&#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">Dave had a lot of experience with physics, for example, and he
      made this 2D physics engine that was very cool, so we knew we wanted to
      use that somehow. And with the <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll Kung Fu</span>
      game, although it was a very small indie game, there were certain
      aspects of that that we knew people really got excited about; in
      particular, the fact that you could easily make your own characters and
      put them in the game, and that you could act. So we had this idea of
      <a name="idx-CHP-3-0051"></a>user-created content and self-expression, if you like,
      coming into the mix.<a name="idx-CHP-3-0052"></a></p>
<p class="docText">So you could say, in a way, that I brought in the <span class="docEmphasis">Rag
      Doll Kung Fu</span>, and Dave brought in the physics element, and
      then Alex was very keen to show off his technical skills&mdash;his graphics
      coding (he made the rendering engine) is second to none! He was also
      down with the kids more than the rest of us, I think, and threw in the
      YouTube/MySpace element. We managed to munge all of this together
      somehow into a small, hands-on demo and presentation, which ended up
      being very cool. Try searching YouTube for "Yellow Head" and you can see
      what the playable part of the presentation was like. That was all put
      together in less than a week, thanks to some ninja physics coding from
      Dave.</p>
<p class="docText">So, this meeting was as much a pitch of talent than of a very
      specific idea, and thankfully, Chris had armed himself with a strange
      magical spell called a "business plan," which told Sony how much cash
      and how many people we needed to make a more fleshed-out demo&#8230;. Phil
      Harrison was suitably impressed with everything, and gave in to our
      demands, which started the ball rolling.</p>
<p class="docText">Following the Sony meeting, Kareem was rapidly signed up as the
      art director and we started to look at what and who we needed to build
      the team, and we quickly found some more arty people, and some more cody
      people, most of which were friends (all very talented). Siobhan joined
      to help organize us, and Mags (who had helped me deal with tax stuff
      related to <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll Kung Fu</span> earnings) joined as our
      bookkeeper, to make sure everyone got paid and that we paid the various
      things that a company needs to pay when employing people!</p>
<p class="docText">The <a name="idx-CHP-3-0053"></a>design process was basically an open discussion followed
      up with something to play or look at on screen/paper or the other way
      around. My main role was always pulling together all these ideas into a
      single document and trying to make them make sense in relation to each
      other so that it could be shared with everyone. This made it clear what
      we were all doing/where we were heading, and became a kind of evolving
      design document.</p>
<p class="docText">Six months soon passed, and we had a very nice
      demo to show Sony (they had been looking at it every month to make sure
      we weren't just drinking the money). This is a fairly formal and pretty
      intimidating meeting known as a "greenlight," and is where the decision
      is made to continue into <a name="idx-CHP-3-0054"></a>full production, or can it! Thankfully, Sony were very
      happy with it&mdash;so happy, in fact, that they decided to show it at GDC in
      Phil's keynote speech, in front of the world media, and well over 5,000
      people!</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: One of the things that's so amazing about the
      game to me is the level creator and the user interface for it. How did
      you guys come about that</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: That evolved over time,
      really. When we first pitched the game it was very much "OK, here's a 2D
      physics platform game and we want to put some user-created content in
      there." That was effectively what we pitched to Sony. And they were
      actually most excited about the user-created content side, which
      surprised us a little bit because we thought they'd be scared about
      that. But once we knew they were into that, we really ran with
      it.</p>
<p class="docText">One of our big strengths is that when we went for that first pitch
      we actually had a playable demo, and I think that made a huge difference
      to getting them excited because there was something that they could
      actually feel and play. I think a lot of publishers get so bored looking
      at PowerPoint presentations.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: You're talking about getting the people you're
      pitching it to excited. Were you able to keep that kind of level of
      excitement up, first between just the core of you guys, and then once
      you started expanding the team? That has to be a big motivator for all
      of you guys. Did that have any impact on how you come up with ideas? How
      you build the software in general</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-3-0055"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Yeah. This is the way
      we've always worked, really&mdash;we wouldn't tend to make a big design
      document upfront saying, "This is what we're going to make." It's very
      vague early on: "OK. We want it to be a 2D kind of physics platform
      thing with some user-created content." Just the act of doing stuff is
      what stirs up the ideas, and then it's like, "Oh, cool. That just gave
      me an idea to do this. Check this out." And we can really feed off each
      other. So, it's very much a sort of jamming type environment, if that
      makes sense, which is only possible when you're just a few people. Once
      you get beyond even six or seven people, you have to start being more
      structured. It just descends into chaos otherwise. The way we dealt with
      this as the team got larger was to create "molecules," which are small
      teams of people working on a particular area. This gives people the
      opportunity to still work in a jamming style.</p>
<p class="docText">The GDC demo was almost identical to the demo we presented at our
      greenlight meeting. It looked really nice, and we actually had some
      creative tools in there. The creative tools that we had at that time
      were completely irrelevant to what we've got now, but it was enough to
      put the seed in there. And it wasn't really until we showed the game at
      GDC to the public for the first time that we realized how excited by the
      idea of being able to create your own levels and <a name="idx-CHP-3-0056"></a>games that people really were. It was getting that
      reaction that really cemented what we were making, I think.</p>
<p class="docText">And that made me very happy, because I'd
      personally always been into the idea <a name="idx-CHP-3-0057"></a>of making something that allows people to make <a name="idx-CHP-3-0058"></a>games easily. It's been my hobby since I was at school,
      and since then I was always in search of the perfect tool that makes it
      really easy to make games.</p>
<p class="docText">A thing to remember is that everyone who joined in on the
      adventure, particularly <a name="idx-CHP-3-0059"></a>before GDC, took a big gamble, leaving well-paid jobs to
      come join a bunch of clowns! And despite various hard times (we had some
      hideous arguments), it's not been that hard to maintain excitement. The
      reaction we got at GDC gave us all a boost in confidence and then we
      received a lot of great support from the games dev community and the
      press, which was really lucky for us. Kareem also really shone as a
      people person, and was very good at keeping everybody's spirits up,
      which has been very valuable, as I can be quite introverted
      sometimes.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: You mentioned that once your team gets a little
      bit too big, you "descend into chaos." Help us understand what it means
      to descend into chaos, and how you get around that</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: You start getting things
      happening on the screen and something that's playable, and then
      everybody throws out other ideas for where you can go with that thing.
      If you don't sit down and actually agree on a direction between you,
      then people will just kind of go off on their own tangents and start
      working on ideas that conflict with each other, and suddenly things
      don't hold together as a complete whole anymore.</p>
<p class="docText">I think what we've managed to do is strike a good balance
      there&mdash;officially, me and Dave were the lead designers of the project,
      but really the game was designed by everyone here. And certainly, what
      my role ended up becoming was kind of absorbing other people's ideas,
      taking them and molding them into something that's coherent, if that
      makes sense, and sometimes having to say, "No, we can't do it like that
      because that just doesn't make sense with what we're trying to achieve
      here now." It was just like trying to hold a vision while dealing with
      an ever-<a name="idx-CHP-3-0060"></a>evolving design, I suppose, if that makes sense.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That makes a lot of sense, and it really jibes
      with what a lot of people have been telling us: that you need to write
      something down to keep a vision. When you say "evolving design," what do
      you mean? Did it evolve steadily? Was there any sort of iterative thing
      that you had going</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Yeah, iteration is the
      right word, I think. Because certainly, some people might be of the
      illusion that you can design a game on a piece of paper, like a
      blueprint, and then send it to the factory and get it made. For some
      games that's probably possible. But in my experience, it just never
      works like that, certainly on the games that I've worked on. It's more
      that you have this high concept&mdash;it's like having an indistinct wire mesh
      of a statue that everyone's chucking clay at, and as you're there just
      trying to sort of smooth it out, it starts to present itself to you.
      It's not that you design it beforehand. You just work at it, and it
      starts to show itself, if that makes sense, and then you kind of mold
      it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Are you the one who does the
      molding, or is it more of a team effort? How do you keep it on vision?
      And how much freedom does everybody else feel to change that vision
      partway through</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-3-0061"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: What I've found myself
      doing at the end of the day was very much trying to hold that top
      vision: "OK. This is going to be a creative tool that allows people to
      make things." And to me, that's essentially what it is. Any ideas that
      came into the mix, I would always be looking at them in that
      context.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Was there a time when someone had wanted to take
      the game in a different direction than you did</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: There were definitely a
      lot of things that we would try that we would then decide, "That's just
      not working," so we'd go back and try something else. Because we're
      quite a small team, we are agile enough, if you will, to suddenly change
      direction. The perfect analogy is the difference between steering a
      speedboat and a supertanker. With the speedboat you can flick the handle
      and change direction. The supertanker takes ages to turn.</p>
<p class="docText">Early on we kind of had a bit of an internal argument, if you
      like, as to whether what we were making was more towards a platform game
      or whether it was more towards a creative tool. Some thought making a
      platform game was more important than the creative tools and others vice
      versa&mdash;I think we ended up in the middle, which was good. We made an
      awesome creative tool, and just so happened to make a great platformer
      that served as an example of what was possible with the tool!</p>
<p class="docText">I must confess, I would often get my way just by becoming in a
      very bad mood and becoming intolerable in the office, which sounds
      terrible, but sometimes it was like that. There were definitely some
      painful moments. I think at any one time all of the directors have
      completely hated each other and wanted to kill each other, which sounds
      bad, but it's good, I think. It shows that we actually care about what
      we're doing. There's definitely a lot of passion in there. And I think
      often we ended up with the best resolution.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Sackboy and Sackgirl, the characters from
      LittleBigPlanet.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: It's interesting you're
      talking about passion for the product and the end goal, because it
      sounds like you guys were really focused on building the right game. How
      do you keep track of the quality of what you're building as you're
      building it, especially as the vision's evolving</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-3-0062"></a><a name="idx-CHP-3-0063"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Just play it all the
      time. I mean, I think that's one of the most important things you can do
      when you're making a game: just play it often. A lot of people
      <a name="idx-CHP-3-0064"></a>forget that. You can sit down and you just play it and
      think things like, "Am I enjoying this? Am I into this? Does this feel
      good or is this really irritating? Is this boring? Ooh, I wish I could
      do this!" I think your target audience has to be yourself, initially.
      You have to make something that meets your own standards of something
      that you want to play. And then, if you're lucky, it'll be something
      that other people like, too. But I think if you set out to make
      something that's going to be impressive to other people, then you're
      kind of doomed to failure, really. So, I think that's probably the way
      to do it.</p>
<p class="docText">It's also always important to test it on people that know nothing
      about it, which can often be quite a painful eye-opener because you can
      become quite self-absorbed in a particular detail. You could end up
      getting really, really obsessed about one particular point in the game,
      and then you show it to somebody else that's never played the game, and
      what you worried about doesn't even come into their radar. Suddenly some
      other obvious point is really brought out into the open. I guess it's a
      good mixture of constantly playing it yourself, but also getting the
      opinions of other people. Testing, testing, testing is the bottom
      line!</p>
<p class="docText">Another important factor as well in terms of quality is having
      quality people. Because we're a small team and we knew from the
      beginning that we wanted to stay a small team, we were very careful
      about who we hired, and we've hired some incredibly talented people;
      that allows you to put trust in people. In my experience, once you get
      big, over 100 people, for example, it's just inevitable that you start
      getting deadwood, people that aren't really there to do something that
      they're proud of; they can be there just to get a salary. There's none
      of that here. Everyone here is really dedicated and proud of their
      work.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: How do you attract the right people? Because
      it's got to be more than just getting smart people or even people who
      have done video game programming before. They have to be right for the
      team, too, especially if it's a small team</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-3-0065"></a><a name="idx-CHP-3-0066"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: It's not easy, actually.
      I mean, initially in our first year, because the game wasn't announced
      publicly or anything like that and we were a new company, it was 10
      times as hard, because you want people that have got experience, people
      that are good at this kind of thing. And we were expecting them to leave
      a well-paid job to come and join a start-up with people that they don't
      know, which can be quite risky.</p>
<p class="docText">The first six months was hard, finding good people; it was
      basically people that already knew us and were interested in what we
      were doing. But once the game was announced at GDC and it got a really
      good response that for us was the perfect recruitment drive.</p>
<p class="docText">Suddenly people are really excited by this
      thing, and were approaching us left, right, and center&mdash;but we had a very
      strict hiring process. Depending on the particular role, we'd have
      different practical tests that we would give to people.</p>
<p class="docText">Interestingly, for the level design, for example, most of the
      people that we took on actually had no games industry experience
      whatsoever. The test we designed for that role was more to test their
      thinking and their creativity. For the programming, it's obviously much
      more technical-based, so we'd give them a broken space invaders-type
      game and ask them to fix the bugs and improve it, make it cool.</p>
<p class="docText">We would also get any potential new hire to talk to other people
      in the team. You can quite quickly get a feel for whether you're going
      to get on with someone or not. And luckily, we chose pretty well. I
      think we've had four people that we ended up not keeping on, because we
      do a probation period. So, we did all right, really.</p>
<p class="docText">Once we found someone that we really did want, it was a case of
      making the proposition attractive to them. We have got a nice family
      atmosphere here; everybody matters. There's no small cogs. Everyone is
      really an important part of the team. And we've also got a very good
      bonus scheme! Everyone that's contributing towards this game, assuming
      that the game makes a lot of money, will make a lot of money, too. It's
      very fair like that, which is not a lot of people's experience in the
      games industry. Quite often, people are kind of worked to the bone and
      then don't really get to see a lot of the rewards, which is a depressing
      fact, but it's true.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds like having respect for the people on
      your team is really important to you</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-3-0067"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: It's essential, because
      I've been a member on many teams before in the past, and I've had good
      and bad. And when it's bad, it's terrible, really. These people are
      investing their life and their <a name="idx-CHP-3-0068"></a>skills in this thing, so they need to get the just
      desserts from that, too.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Hey, I had a question. It's a little bit of a
      jump, but I love the music. I'm a musician and I've been really
      impressed with the choices&mdash;they're really perfect for the
      game</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Oh, yeah. There's some
      great tunes in there!</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I've really never heard anything like it in a
      video game. How did that soundtrack come about? Is there a story behind
      that? How did it happen</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-3-0069"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: With our initial pitch to
      Sony, and in our monthly "show them what we're up to" meetings, we
      tended to use that kind of music with any videos that we presented. It
      helped to create a nice vibe. And it was a progression from that, I
      suppose. Once we started making the game, we'd set the tone with those
      videos. Now we had a major publisher financing the game, and suddenly
      they'd start telling us things like, "Well, we can license these tracks.
      You can use them in the game."</p>
<p class="docText">So, literally everyone on the team just
      started putting forward ideas for songs and things that they liked, and
      we kind <a name="idx-CHP-3-0070"></a>of gave that to Sony and they found out whether they could
      get the licensing or not. That was it, really.</p>
<p class="docText">The original interactive music was written as a collaboration. We
      started working with another friend, Mat, who has a studio and access to
      lots of real musicians. He wrote some music for us, and then when Kenny
      Young joined us just after GDC, he collaborated with Mat to write all of
      the original interactive tracks. Kenny also managed the process of going
      back and forth on the licensed tracks and creating all the sound
      effects&mdash;quite a guy!</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: And the tutorials in the game, you got Steven Fry
      to do the voice</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Yes!</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: That's really cool. How did you swing
      that</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: It was me who really
      wanted that, because with the whole creative tool and the interface, we
      really needed some tutorials, so I prototyped these as <a name="idx-CHP-3-0071"></a>videos, and I kind of had in mind, "If I'm going to have
      someone teaching me about things, they need to sound interesting, and
      funny." [Douglas Adams's] <span class="docEmphasis">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
      Galaxy</span> (Del Rey) immediately sprung to mind. I don't know if
      you've seen that film or read the books, but Steven Fry did the voice of
      <span class="docEmphasis">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span> book in the
      film. And I was just like, "It would be so perfect if we could get him,"
      not really thinking that it's a possibility. But someone in Sony heard
      me say that, and the next thing I know, it's like, "OK. We've got Steven
      Fry. He's into it."</p>
<p class="docText">The next thing I know, I'm in a studio, watching this huge
      character of a man read through the scripts to the game! I got to meet a
      hero! So that's definitely one of the cool things about working with a
      big publisher. They can make things like that happen. And we were lucky
      he was really excited and into the whole game. That was a dream come
      true, really. I do think his voice is perfect for it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: A few times now you've said, "I wanted that and I
      got it." So, clearly you were leading this. As much as there were
      various factions within the team, groups of people who wanted to take it
      in different directions&mdash;creative tool versus straight-ahead
      platformer&mdash;you were pushing it. Do you consider yourself sort of a
      leader? What do you think characterizes a good leader</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: I think there's a few
      leaders here. I'm just one of them. And at any one time one of us will
      shout louder than the others if we feel more passionate about it. So
      certainly, there were some things where I would just get incredibly
      moody and just make everyone's life hell until I got my way. But then
      with other things it would be Alex, Dave, or Kareem (or someone else)
      passionately wanting to take something in a certain direction. We'd go
      into a room and argue about it, and quite often someone would have a
      much better point than somebody else, so they would win&#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">So I would never say that I was the lead in
      here, but I think I'm probably the person that's capable of getting in
      the worst mood. It's a bit of a sad tactic, but it works. Most of the
      time.</p>
<p class="docText">In terms of what makes a good leader, it depends what you're
      leading, really. Someone like Kareem who leads the artists is a very
      good people person; he never resorts to the iron fist, and is also a
      damn good artist, so he is always able to lead by hands-on example. But
      I think the best skill a leader can have is to choose the right team in
      the first place, and let them lead themselves as much as
      possible.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, if there are several leaders, if it's more of
      a team effort, what makes for a good team? If you were trying to put
      together, say, a dream team for building a game, or any piece of
      software, what would you look for? Not just for the people on the team,
      but for the team itself</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: You need people that are
      actually very skilled in particular areas. Dave, he's incredibly good at
      physics and maths, for example, and Alex is very good at graphics
      programming (and maths and graphic design, actually!). My real hardcore
      skill is technical art. Kareem is less technical than I am, but is much
      better at drawing and painting than I am; he spends every spare second
      he has painting naked bodies. There are lots of other essential people I
      haven't mentioned: a good HR person is pretty essential, and you need
      someone to look after the working environment (water plants, feed people
      working late, etc.). So you need people that are very good and
      specialized in their particular areas, but that are also interested in
      the other areas and can contribute to those as well. People are very
      responsible for owning certain parts of the game/company, but there's
      that wide enough interest so that they can contribute to everything
      else. And last of all, but probably the most important, is chemistry.
      Matching the right people with each other is essential; having two
      geniuses work together that get on each other's nerves is
      disastrous!</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: A lot of people, myself included, dream of one
      day doing what you've done: building a great video game that a lot of
      people love. Do you have any advice for them</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: All I can say is that
      it's been a painful process, but incredibly rewarding. And it's
      definitely taught me a lot about myself as a person, I think. I wouldn't
      underestimate how much hard work it is to do something like this, but
      also that it is completely possible, and if you don't have a go, it will
      never happen. If you really want to do it, you've just got to make a
      start, go and do it, see what happens, roll with it, and not give up
      when things get tough.</p>
