<h3 id="title-IDA3DUYH" class="docSection1Title">30.5. Capitulating</h3>
<p class="docText">War correspondents in every conflict wire home stories of
        chauffeurs who try to avoid known roadblocks by taking detours through
        back country. Often the new route proves more deadly than the one they
        avoided. Such was the case with Longjump.</p>
<p class="docText">Speed on this project only caused time to accelerate, rather
        than to slow down as Einstein said it would. After only a month or
        two, our engineers realized that our new system components were not
        working together, and that software porting was going badly. We had no
        time to lose; we could hemorrhage at any roadblock. The investors
        insisted on meeting our schedule, so someone at the top laid down a
        radical shift of direction.</p>
<p class="docText">Instead of incorporating the RISC chip into a custom-designed
        and custom-built system, we would become a value-added retailer for
        another successful computer firm that was selling a computer based on
        that chip. Adopting their computer system would require only some
        scrambling around at the top of the device and software stack, rather
        than the intensive mixing and baking that the chefs of our engineering
        staff had originally planned.</p>
<p class="docText">Many of us felt our hearts sink upon hearing this strategy.
        Although it was certainly a blow to our pride to be using another
        vendor's product, we had substantive reasons for fearing the switch as
        well. Without our secret sauce, our craftsmanlike reengineering of the
        system from bottom to top, we would lose most of our performance
        advantages. We were, in effect, offering customers a generic computer
        system that happened to be backwardly compatible with our previous
        systems. Only the new RISC architecture would (hopefully) provide
        enough of a performance boost to make the move worthwhile.</p>
<p class="docText">Grumbling was evident throughout the halls in those days. Staff
        at lower levels sensed that George was not playing the role a project
        leader should play, which would entail explaining to management the
        full consequences of their choice.</p>
<p class="docText">A popular cubicle decoration at that period
        was a fanciful series of brief reports moving up the management chain
        from an individual contributor to a company CEO. The individual
        contributor labeled his project a stinking pile of manure. This crass
        assessment softened in each report as it rose through the management
        hierarchy. By the time the news reached the CEO, he was
        enthusiastically announcing the project's potential for growing
        sweet-smelling flowers.</p>
<p class="docText">I mentioned at the beginning of this article that to survive
        projects like Longjump, staff must constantly reconcile short-term
        tasks with their professional judgment. A couple of months into the
        project, the effort of such reconciliation became exhausting. Not
        every request could be solved by solutions such as the Emacs macros I
        gave Kimberly.</p>
<p class="docText">Engineers started prefacing or ending their task descriptions
        with comments like "Not that this will do any good" and "I don't see
        how this will work." But soon the comments stopped. Saying them to
        cubicle neighbors was redundant, because they all were in agreement
        already. But the comments were also seen as a waste of time, because
        top management was responding only to investor pressure.</p>
<p class="docText">Worst of all, none of the individual contributors could offer a
        better way to meet our goals and deadlines. But being engineers rather
        than investors, we felt we'd have more chance of success by
        lengthening the project schedule and creating a system that maintained
        our unique advantages than by hoodwinking our customers with a "me
        too" product whose resemblance to our earlier products was only
        skin-deep. The moment for such an argument had passed, however. No
        longer did the engineers' opinions carry weight in the company's major
        engineering decisions, as they had throughout its history.</p>
