<blockquote>
<p class="docText">Mission Statement: To give our clients a competitive advantage
          by applying advances in technology that enhances their customer
          relationships.<a name="idx-CHP-28-0872"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">To describe our early software development practices as
        primitive would be an extreme understatement. After several months of
        slow progress, we reached a level of technology in software
        development equal to that of the clan of monkeys in the opening
        sequence of Kubrick's <span class="docEmphasis">2001: A Space Odyssey</span>, with
        similar levels of wild shrieking and skull crushing. In the plus
        column, I had previously seen the light&mdash;and had been delivered from
        evil&mdash;by the power and the glory of source control. From the start, we
        employed source control for our Visual Basic code. However, the vast
        majority of our business logic, a hundred thousand lines of T-SQL,
        remained unsaved in the limbo that was our development database. The
        extent of our SQL change management process started and ended with C$.
        All changes went through him. We had to assume he had some method to
        his madness. He was, after all, the self-professed greatest SQL Server
        developer in Pittsburgh (or was it the entire East Coast?). In his
        defense, he was not entirely conceited. He often brought up a
        developer and tech columnist who might have been better "but he died
        when his snowmobile crashed into a tree!&#8230;" And after his trademark
        paroxysm of laughter, he'd somberly say, "I feel really bad for his
        family, he was a father of three."</p>
<p class="docText">We rarely even knew what we were supposed to be doing. [Imagine
        Colts head coach Jim Mora's voice when you read the next quote.]
        "Detailed <a name="idx-CHP-28-0873"></a>specifications!? Detailed specifications!!?" We were
        lucky to have detailed conversations. C$ was always on the move, and
        always in a hurry. Human communication was too limited to keep up with
        his quadrants. When he had time, you might get an email describing
        what we should have been doing. Failing that, if you were lucky, you
        might get a phone call. I wasn't the only one who recognized and
        complained about many of our process shortcomings, but no one was in a
        position to take unilateral action. Most team members were supposed to
        be working on Edsel, a system for managing petroleum exploration
        partnerships, but much of the application's design referenced
        functionality that existed in an AS/400 application&mdash;an application
        that none of us had seen and none of us could access.</p>
<p class="docText">Secretly, I was still holding out for signs of a plan. Maybe we
        were to beaver away day and night, like the World War II allied code
        breakers in Bletchley Park, cracking the German Enigma cipher, each
        focusing on some tiny chunk of the whole, never seeing enough to know
        what we were building. And one day, the last piece of the puzzle would
        be put in place, and Hedley's and C$'s grand
        vision would be revealed: our state-of-the-art, multi-utility billing
        system we'll call the <a name="idx-CHP-28-0874"></a>Candygram [because "the bitch was inventing the
        Candygram"]. We'd leverage the technical architecture we'd built for
        Edsel, and <a name="idx-CHP-28-0875"></a>Rock Ridge would be positioned to take on the brave new
        world of the deregulated energy market. More likely, we were like a
        lot of the other companies that were struggling to get a foothold in a
        promising market; we often just sucked at what we tried to do.</p>
<p class="docText">But there was soon some reason for optimism in the atmosphere
        (and thanks to our new office, more than just optimism was in the
        air). Stan was revealed to be a surprisingly gifted employee. Most
        importantly for us, he had a personality bigger than even his physical
        presence, and he could program, too. The team recognized this, and for
        the rest of his time at Rock Ridge, he was its center of gravity. This
        meant his cube or office also served as a social center, which would
        remain a career-long drain on his productivity. Now the team had a
        chance to solidify, and with the help of a few more hires, it became
        an effective counterweight to C$. The improved group dynamics blunted
        some of C$'s rougher edges and helped to fill in the void left behind
        when his time was demanded elsewhere. With some success, trust started
        to take root and this found C$ delegating more and more. He was even
        becoming occasionally receptive to opinions other than his own. We had
        a long way to go, but soon we at least began to develop <a name="idx-CHP-28-0876"></a>processes, standards, and what was the start of a truly
        impressive billing system. We had passed another critical point.
        Crucially, the nucleus of the team was forged while our roles were
        still malleable, and before anyone significant had a chance to
        defect.</p>
<p class="docText">Candygram's first customer would be a small division of a large
        utility company. We were lucky to have VPC (Very Patient Company) as
        its first user. And not just because the second biggest deal the sales
        team ever inked was our bar tab when our sales manager accidentally
        left it open during a much extended happy hour. VPC was like a homely
        and not-too-bright first girlfriend. They put up with our poor-quality
        releases and our sloppiness, and they gave us the chance to refine our
        technique on a real, live customer for a change. I just don't think
        they expected any better.</p>
<p class="docText">We were still a year or more from having any sort of repeatable
        release process. The best we had were some batch files that automated
        the application of the release's scripts to the database. Determining
        exactly what belonged in a particular release, and how to make those
        changes without corrupting the data, was an entirely manual process.
        Two developers working independently from the same code base were not
        guaranteed to create the same end result, so the final product varied
        depending on who built it and on what computer it was built. As a
        result, components and/or database objects were often missing or
        improperly configured, causing all sorts of downstream errors.</p>
<p class="docText">I got to see just how tolerant VPC could be, firsthand, when I
        got fingered to deliver the latest database release, as I was already
        going to update the client app. C$ had tapped a relatively new guy to
        assemble the database package: The Sigh Guy (TSG), a bright,
        hard-working, and chronologically young man. You could almost see the
        weight of the world prematurely aging him right
        before your eyes. I was shocked some months later when I found a
        picture of him from his college days. He was a portrait of vitality,
        but now it looked as if he had been made of wax and left in the hot
        sun. C$ ensured that he got no respite at work. I tagged him with the
        nickname (we all had many), because if he was around, you were soon to
        hear an exasperated sigh. The external pressures rendered him only
        about 90% great, which doesn't sound too bad, unless you consider it
        in terms of things like airplane safety, or more relevantly, database
        code. TSG was a pathologically bad typist. His typos were often so
        improbable that they seemed to have been made on purpose. Working from
        one of his designs, I created a half dozen dialogs implementing "Colon
        Batch" functionality. I knew it couldn't be right, but he couldn't
        have so consistently typed "Colon" instead of "Clone," right? That was
        worth a good laugh, but it wasn't so funny when I began to update
        VPC's <a name="idx-CHP-28-0877"></a>Candygram database. I liked TSG from the start, so there
        was little hesitation that afternoon when I initiated the upgrade. It
        had been "tested." Seconds later I was treated with an exception, and
        a database table was now empty of all its data. While the client's DBA
        restored the database, I remained on the phone with TSG. Finding an
        errant keystroke, we started again. We would repeat this cycle of
        events&mdash;Execute, Error, Debug, Apologize, Restore&mdash;for the next six
        hours.</p>
<p class="docText">One thing even C$ had difficulty exaggerating, where he was a
        master of his domain, was in his encyclopedic knowledge of the
        Candygram System. Our lack of change control, specs, and <a name="idx-CHP-28-0878"></a>processes meant we relied on it almost completely. It
        was self-perpetuating, too. He was the only one who knew the whole
        story, which meant he had to be consulted on everything. Delegating
        the release process in those early days could be especially
        disastrous. Because the company needed the cash, we had prematurely
        released the system fully aware that significant functionality was far
        from complete. We now had the joy of developing and maintaining a live
        system critical to the client's business. Worse still, a host of
        quality issues turning up daily in production kept one of our SQL
        experts fighting fires on-site for weeks at a stretch. Since time was
        of the essence, we were often developing directly on the live system.
        The pattern of bad decisions leading to and from money problems would
        cripple all our efforts every single day.</p>
<p class="docText">I understood the definition of quality before I started working
        there, and it was something we all desired. I knew the non-linear
        nature of the cost of an issue versus product timeline. But it still
        took a while to learn just how absolutely fundamental it was to the
        success or failure of a company. It was more important than any
        decision we could make in technology, hiring, or strategy. It wasn't
        just the raw number of issues, either. Perception mattered, and first
        impressions especially so. Once we lost the faith of one of our
        customers, no amount of effort, negotiation, or groveling seemed to
        win it back. Quality issues would poison our relationships, led to
        poor references, killed future sales, weakened our bargaining
        position, and led to unreasonable promises, piling more stress on an
        already overstretched development team. Hedley never seemed to grasp
        this. While we survived long enough to become much better developers,
        we were never good enough to break the cycle.</p>

<p class="docText">Subject: <a name="idx-CHP-28-0880"></a>Candygram System 3.0</p>
<p class="docText">As everyone knows, Rock Ridge has been consumed with the
          Candygram System 3.0 (CS3) development for VPC Retail Services. Our
          entire organization has been working very hard to reach our goal and
          I would like to the time to acknowledge the effort. Thank
          you.</p>
<p class="docText">The Beta date for CS3 is now May 5,1999. This Beta version
          will include customer inquiry; order, adjustment, and receipt batch
          processing; service cycle processing; bill processing and posting;
          as well as master and support table functionality. We will also
          implement security roles and permissions and robust error messaging.
          We have been Beta testing the Candygram System Import (CSI) Utility
          at VPCR over the past two weeks. The CSI was written for the VPCR
          custom data feed between RSSC (a VPCR system) and Candygram. The CSI
          will also handle lockbox data loads. This testing has been very
          valuable not only to work the kinks out of the CSI, but also to
          avoid the same issue in CS3. VPCR plans to begin using the CSI to
          load 130,000 Customers for the Beta testing period. CSI coding will
          be complete April 26, 1999.</p>
<p class="docText">We need to continue to focus and work towards our dates.
          Overall the system looks very good and I am pleased with the
          cohesiveness of the team. Soon the project will transition to an
          implementation and support phase, where other members of the
          organization will carry the torch handed off by the designers and
          coders.</p>
<p class="docText">It's not easy being the best. We just need to make it look
          easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Quality issues were like landmines: able to lay dormant for
        extended periods. At what seemed to be the most inopportune time,
        they'd cripple us. Issues with Edsel, the project that functioned as
        an organ donor to Candygram, hit us well over a year after delivery.
        Just in time to hobble us in the lead up to our biggest Candygram
        development push. We'd have to work heroically to make up that time
        that was already overpromised to our biggest client, a
        multibillion-dollar company that had spent years waging multiple wars
        of attrition with companies much larger than ours, and which had only
        red ink, derelict billing system implementations, and ongoing lawsuits
        to show for it. Was this the recipe for success?</p>

<p class="docText">Subject: Edsel Training/Implementation</p>
<p class="docText">Finally, there is quite a bit of history concerning JJ,
          Whiney, and the Edsel development. They are very bitter and angry
          that the system has taken so long to develop. Actually, it was
          shelved for a year by Sisyphus after which they said that Sisyphus
          would not use it. Less than two weeks ago Sisyphus decided to
          implement it and gave us only a week to do it. Sisyphus management
          knows that not all aspects of the system are completed. We will be
          limiting the scope to possibly the generation of commission
          amounts and a request for check form. Also, we
          will be transferring data to and from the AS/400 in Akron. In
          summary, I anticipate a lot of work on Edsel for several months to
          come.</p>
<p class="docText">P.S. JJ can be combative and abrasive. He is rough but he
          knows his stuff. I think that generally we should give him what he
          wants. Whiney on the other hand does not have a firm grasp of the
          concept of databases. I would strongly suggest that we implement
          none of Whiney's changes unless they are approved by JJ.</p>
