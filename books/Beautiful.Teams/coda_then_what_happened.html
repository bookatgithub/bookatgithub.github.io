<p class="docText">Since I became an independent consultant in 1998, I have
        primarily worked with clients on an intervention basis. I provide
        training, coaching, or assistance with particular problems a client is
        experiencing. I often do not get to see how the project turns out as a
        result of my involvement. That was true with the CTS project&mdash;at
        first.</p>
<p class="docText">Following our successful <a name="idx-CHP-19-0622"></a>requirements development effort, I moved on to other
        activities and shortly thereafter moved to an entirely separate
        division within Contoso Pharmaceuticals. Two years later, I left
        Contoso and started my own software training and consulting company. I
        use several examples from the Chemical Tracking System in my training
        courses to illustrate techniques and insights for requirements
        development.</p>
<p class="docText">In 1999, I was presenting a requirements course at a client
        site. When I shared some of our experiences on CTS, one student in the
        class said, "Hey, I recognize that project!" This student happened to
        work in marketing. His previous employer was the company that Contoso
        approached for outsourcing the implementation of part of the CTS.
        Intrigued by this coincidence, I asked him how the implementation went
        and what the developers at his former company thought of the CTS
        requirements. I was relieved when he said that the project went well
        and that the requirements were a major factor in that success.</p>
<p class="docText">Despite its rocky beginning, the Chemical Tracking System turned
        out to be an illuminating case study. We learned how to selectively
        and thoughtfully apply several new requirements development methods.
        We found ways to effectively engage diverse customer representatives
        in the process. We enjoyed some cultural benefits through our
        collaborative approach, as Paul and the other lead customers realized
        that it was indeed possible&mdash;nay, essential&mdash;to work closely with IT
        representatives to make sure that the right product comes out the
        other end of the process. Best of all, this application is still in
        use at Contoso Pharmaceuticals, 13 years after the requirements
        development experience described here.</p>
