<h3 id="title-IDAT1TYH" class="docSection1Title">30.4. Coding</h3>
<p class="docText">It's always useful to have a few tools to support changes in
        organizational behavior. As a modest example, I implemented my
        agenda-driven meeting schedule by posting a file in a shared
        directory. The likelihood of two people editing the file at the same
        time was negligible, but the concepts of
        operating systems and threads had been drilled into me and I therefore
        felt a heightened sensitivity toward race conditions. Consequently, I
        bundled access to the agenda in a simple script that used some basic
        command such as <tt>chmod</tt> to provide a simple locking
        mechanism using the filesystem.</p>
<p class="docText">A bigger tools challenge was posed by the manpages I mentioned
        earlier. All of our language tools were based on a new compiler suite
        that came from our vendor. We decided that editing our manpages to
        reflect the new system would take a prohibitive amount of effort, so
        the decree came down from somewhere that we should convert the
        vendor's manpages to fit our system.</p>
<p class="docText">The problem was that the vendor had given us pages only in
        output format, and to accommodate our customers' needs we required the
        pages in source format. The typical output we had looked like
        this:</p>
<pre>
O^HO^HOP^HP^HPT^HT^HTI^HI^HIO^HO^HON^HN^HNS^HS^HS
-^H-^H-o^Ho^Ho _^Hf_^Hi_^Hl_^He
Output binary image to _^Hf_^Hi_^Hl_^He.
</pre><br />
<p class="docText">That's a brief description of the classic <tt>-o</tt>
        compiler option. What appears as <tt>^H</tt> here is
        actually a backspace character (ASCII value 8) that causes the
        terminal to superimpose the following character on the preceding one.
        Superimposing the same character three times, in the format shown,
        causes it to appear in bold on the terminal. Superimposing a character
        on an underscore produces underlining.</p>
<p class="docText">What we needed instead were the original
        <tt>troff</tt> macros used to generate manpages, in which
        the preceding sequence would look like this:</p>
<pre>
.SS Options
.TP
/fB-o/fP /fI-file/fP
Output binary image to /fI-file/fP.
</pre><br />
<p class="docText">How could a writer convert dozens of pages documenting hundreds
        of options from output to source format? Typically for the Longjump
        project, the human and organizational costs&mdash;the veritable absurdity of
        such a job&mdash;were ignored by management, and a junior writer, Kimberly,
        was tasked with doing the conversion by hand.</p>
<p class="docText">By the time news of this job reached me, Kimberly was beside
        herself. She was in her first year of the job, which was her crucial
        first year in the computer field, and was the type of new hire who was
        eager to demonstrate her industriousness and loyalty. She would go to
        any length to satisfy a request from management. But as we sat
        together scoping out the job, paging through screen after screen of
        garbage at her terminal, she cried out, "I don't see how I can ever
        finish this job. I don't even know where to start."</p>
<p class="docText">Why didn't the company go back to our vendor and insist they
        give us the manpages in source format? I don't know. Perhaps my
        manager and I just didn't have enough experience to argue forcefully
        enough for this action. Perhaps no one had noticed the problem
        before signing the contract, and there was no
        recourse now. Or perhaps the vendor sensed that Edom Engineering posed
        a competitive threat, and maliciously withheld the source files. In
        any case, we seemed stuck.</p>
<p class="docText">I decided to apply my modest programming skills to bring the
        project within a human being's purview. The hoary old
        <tt>troff</tt> format, particularly in output form, resisted
        mechanized processing. Even advanced AI techniques would probably not
        suffice to recognize all elements of a page, such as the section
        heading (.SS) and tagged item paragraph (.TP).</p>
<p class="docText">But I found a woman/machine collaboration that worked, and wrote
        some Emacs Lisp macros to automate as much activity as possible.
        Kimberly needed only to find a familiar element&mdash;such as a section
        heading or tagged item&mdash;position the Emacs cursor (point) over it, and
        press a single key to convert a paragraph to the right format. When I
        showed her the basic keystrokes, she nearly jumped out of her seat in
        excitement, and her relief was so great that she launched into the
        conversion of her first manpage with actual pleasure. Later she told
        me, "Those macros saved my life."</p>
