        line-by-line change itself (expressed in the "patch" format mentioned
        earlier, except that for historical reasons, in this context the patch

<p class="docText">When done right, <a name="idx-CHP-21-0675"></a>commit emails are a powerful <a name="idx-CHP-21-0676"></a>collaboration tool for software projects. They're a
        perfect marriage of automated information flow and human
        participation. Each change arrives in the developer's mailbox packaged
        as a well-understood, discrete unit: an email. The developer can view
        the change using a comfortable and familiar interface (her
        mailreader), and if she sees something that looks questionable, she
        can reply, quoting just the parts of the change that interest her, and
        her reply will automatically be put into a thread that connects the
        change to everyone's comments on it. Thus, by taking advantage of the
        data management conventions already in place for email, people (and
        other programs) can conveniently track the fallout from any given
        change. <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-21-FNOTE-6">[]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-21-FNOTE-6">[]</a></sup> For more on this practice, see <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href=""></a>

<p class="docText">Together, those two emails contain the same information as a
        single one like the one I showed earlier from the Subversion project.
        But the key word is <span class="docEmphasis">together</span>. They are not
        together; they are separate. Although the programmer <a name="idx-CHP-21-0681"></a>committed a single change, <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-21-FNOTE-9">[]</a></sup> there is no single email containing everything a
        reviewer would need to understand and review that change. To review a
        change, you need the log message so that you can understand the
        general intent of the change, and the diff so that you can see whether
        the actual code edits match that intent.<a name="idx-CHP-21-0682"></a></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-21-FNOTE-9">[]</a></sup> Some people use the word <span class="docEmphasis">changeset</span> for
            what I'm talking about here: the situation where perhaps multiple
            files were modified, but the modifications are all part of a
            single logical group. We can call that overall group a "change" or
            a "changeset"; the two words mean the same thing in this
            context.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">It turns out that if people don't have both of these things in
        one place, they're much less likely to review changes.</p>
<p class="docText">Or so it seems from my highly rigorous
        <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-21-FNOTE-10">[]</a></sup> survey comparing the two projects. In February 2008,
        there were 207 unique threads (from 908 messages) on the Subversion
        development list. Of these, 50 were follow-up threads to <a name="idx-CHP-21-0683"></a>commit emails. So by one reasonable measurement, 24% of
        development list attention goes to commit review (or if you want to
        count messages instead of threads, then a little over 5%). Note that
        follow-ups to Subversion <a name="idx-CHP-21-0684"></a>commit emails are automatically directed to the main
        development list via a Reply-to header, so the development list is the
        right data set to use.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-21-FNOTE-10">[]</a></sup> Read: "extremely anecdotal."</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Meanwhile, in February 2008, the Emacs development list had 491
        unique threads (from 3,158 messages), of which, apparently, zero were
        review mails.</p>
<p class="docText">Stunned at this result, I loosened my filters for detecting
        review mails and scanned again. This time I came up with, at most, 49
        emails. But spot-checking those 49 showed that most seemed to be
        <a name="idx-CHP-21-0685"></a>reviews of patches posted to the list from elsewhere,
        rather than reviews based on <a name="idx-CHP-21-0686"></a>commit emails; only two were definite review mails.
        However, even if we count all 49 (which is almost certainly overly
        permissive), that's at most 10% of the development list traffic being
        commit reviews (or 1.5%, if we count messages instead of threads).
        Because Emacs does not automatically redirect commit email follow-ups
        to the main development list, I also searched in the <a name="idx-CHP-21-0687"></a>commits list and the diffs list archives. I found no
        review follow-ups there in February, and exactly two in March, both of
        which were from me.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, the two projects have different commit rates and different
        traffic levels on their development lists. But we can partially
        control for this by approaching the question from the other side: what
        percentage of commits gets reviewed? In February 2008, Subversion had
        274 unique commits, and Emacs had 807. <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-21-FNOTE-11">[]</a></sup> Thus, the ratio of review threads to commits for
        Subversion is about 18%, and for Emacs is somewhere between 0% and 6%
        (but probably tending low, around 0.2%, if there really were only two
        true review mails).</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-21-FNOTE-11">[]</a></sup> If you're checking these numbers against primary <a name="idx-CHP-21-0688"></a>sources, note that when counting Emacs commits, you
            shouldn't count commits that affect only
            <tt>ChangeLog</tt> files, because (due to certain
            oddities of the way the Emacs project uses its version control
            system) those are duplicates of other commits.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Something is happening here, something that makes one project
        much more likely than the other to do peer review. What is it?</p>
<p class="docText">I cannot prove it, of course, but I think it's simply the fact
        that each Emacs commit arrives separated into two emails: one for the
        log message and another for the diff. There is no way, using a normal
        mail-reading interface without extensive customizations, to view the
        log message and the diff at the same time. Thus, <span class="docEmphasis">there is no
        convenient way to review a change</span>. It's not that review is
        impossible, or even hard. It's neither: if I wanted to, I could review
        all the Emacs commits, and so could the other developers. But each
        review would require shuffling back and forth between two emails, or
        clicking on the URL in the shorter email and waiting for a page to
        load. In practice, it's too much trouble, and I can never be bothered.
        Apparently, neither can anyone else.</p>
<p class="docText">There's a sobering lesson here: adding a
        few seconds of overhead to a common task is enough to make that task
        uncommon. Your team isn't lazy, just human. Put light switches at
        roughly shoulder level and people will happily turn off lights when
        they leave a room; put the switches at knee level, and your
        electricity bill will skyrocket.</p>
<p class="docText">What is the cost to a project of not getting code review? Pretty
        high, I think. Looking over the Subversion <a name="idx-CHP-21-0689"></a>commits for that month, 55 indicate that they follow up
        to a previous specific commit, and 35 bear a special marker (see
        <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href=""></a>)
        indicating that they fix problems found by someone else. In my
        experience with the project, such suggestions are usually the result
        of commit review. Thus, probably somewhere between 12% and 20% of the
        commits made in Subversion result from review of previous commits. I
        cannot easily come up with the comparable number for Emacs, because
        Emacs does not have standardized attribution conventions the way
        Subversion does. But I've been watching Emacs development for a long
        time, and while it's clear that some percentage of commits there
        results from reviews of previous commits (or from just stumbling
        across problematic code in the course of other work), I do not believe
        it reaches 12% to 20%.</p>
<p class="docText">Besides, the benefits of timely commit review cannot be measured
        solely in further code changes. Commit review sustains morale,
        sharpens people's skills (because they're all learning from each
        other), reinforces a team's ability to work together (because everyone
        gets accustomed to receiving constructive criticism from everyone
        else), and spurs participation (because review happens in public, thus
        encouraging others to do the same). To deprive a team of these
        benefits because of a trivial user interface choice is a costly
        mistake.</p>
