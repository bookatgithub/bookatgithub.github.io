<p class="docText">One of the XP practices is to adopt an <a name="idx-CHP-15-0423"></a>open workspace. The practice involves giving the team
        its own space to work. In the center is a big table. Project
        information is plastered on the walls. Computers are set up on the
        table so that it's easy to collaborate.</p>
<p class="docText">We did not have an <a name="idx-CHP-15-0424"></a>open workspace and we discovered that working in cubes
        was not great. The monitors were in the corners and that made working
        together tough. We started talking about taking down some cube walls
        so that we could have a good space for communication and
        collaboration.</p>
<p class="docText">I asked Johnny about moving some walls. He said, "We can't do
        that; we have union people who configure all the furniture. We have to
        go through them." I had envisioned how Peter Gibbons, the frustrated
        programmer from the movie <span class="docEmphasis">Office Space</span>,
        unfastened his wall and it toppled, freeing him from his cube. That
        was not going to happen. It was time to visit Bud.</p>
<p class="docText">I said, "Bud, the cube walls are hurting our ability to
        communicate. We should take down a few cubes and make a space for the
        team."</p>
<p class="docText">"Save your energy for something else; that one is a non-starter.
        We have a policy for furniture reconfiguration," Bud sighed. "Once a
        wall or office is changed in an office area," he said as he gestured
        to a lattice of 50 or more cubes, "the whole area must be brought up
        to the current office specs."</p>
<p class="docText">I replied: "Yeah, so what does that mean? Can we have an open
        workspace area?"</p>
<p class="docText">Bud: "I am not sure of that detail, but if we change one wall,"
        he answered, pointing to the private offices along the outside wall,
        "all those senior engineers and managers will lose their private
        offices and doors. You can't make this one happen." Bud consoled us
        that if it was our process, he could do something about it. "But
        moving a wall gets the union involved, and there is no flexibility
        there."</p>
<p class="docText">This battle was over before it started. We could have pouted and
        whined. Instead, we got back to work and lived <a name="idx-CHP-15-0425"></a>within what was possible. Pickled again.</p>
