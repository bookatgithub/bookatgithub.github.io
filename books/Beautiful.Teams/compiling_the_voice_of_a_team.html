<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andy Oram</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">COMPANIES COME AND GO. THE LASTING ASSET
      IS THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR THEM. PEOPLE BRING TO</span> their new
      jobs the sum of their experiences&mdash;not just technical skills, but
      interpersonal patterns that they build up through years of dealing with
      colleagues and managers.</p>
<p class="docText">In this light, we can balance the importance of a project's
      formal, stated deliverables against the seemingly peripheral impressions
      its staff get along the way. I'd bet that you could cite very few
      projects from your own career whose deliverables are still in use.
      Taking this observation into account, I've always felt that a <a name="idx-CHP-30-0910"></a>project's impact on the growth of its staff is just as
      important as the defined project goal. In fact, I see that as the
      premise behind this book.</p>
<p class="docText">This principle carries the most force in extreme cases where
      projects are headed inexorably for failure. I had the misfortune of
      working on just such a project 20 years ago. The only positive result I
      can remember was a moment of illumination during which I pulled together
      the collective wisdom of the contributors and gave it a <a name="idx-CHP-30-0911"></a>voice.</p>
<p class="docText">Personal survival becomes a triumph on this kind of project,
      because the project challenges your professional judgment on a daily
      basis: the need to square jerry-rigged solutions with the team's
      long-term responsibilities; to maintain your integrity and your
      friends under unbearable scheduling pressures; to
      hear and nod at requests that both the bearer and the recipient know to
      be unfeasible, then take them back to your cubicle and adjust them to
      engineering realities.</p>
<p class="docText">Projects that threaten survival also expose the tender boundary
      where the ego&mdash;which is responsible for civilized behavior&mdash;threatens to
      dissolve back into the frenzies of the id. I hit this boundary once
      during the project described in this chapter. But an intrepid suggestion
      by my manager directed my anguish into a surprising recovery&mdash;giving a
      <a name="idx-CHP-30-0912"></a>voice to the individual contributors on the project in a
      way I believe helped us all survive.</p>
<p class="docText">Looking back on our audacious stroke, I also see in it the seed of
      a <a name="idx-CHP-30-0913"></a>new relationship between individual contributors and
      management. My manager and I were groping toward a view of corporate
      behavior that is currently hawked by leading management consultants in
      business journals and books facing out on bookstore shelves. We were
      yearning for a flattened, less vertical command structure based on
      direct communication up and down the hierarchy, and were exploring the
      power of digital technology to implement that structure.</p>
<p class="docText">In short, through an impulsive gesture, I anticipated a vision
      that would be articulated by organizational experts two decades
      later.</p>
