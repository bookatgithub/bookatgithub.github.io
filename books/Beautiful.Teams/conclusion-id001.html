<h3 id="title-IDAB3PRX" class="docSection1Title">21.9. Conclusion</h3>
<p class="docText">From the preceding examples, we can distill a few <a name="idx-CHP-21-0705"></a>principles of <a name="idx-CHP-21-0706"></a>collaboration tools:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Good tools get the fundamental units of information
            right.</p><p class="docList">For example, with commit emails, the fundamental unit is the
            change (or "changeset"). When the tool failed to treat each change
            as a single logical entity, and instead divided it across multiple
            interface access points (in this case, emails), people became less
            inclined to inspect the change.</p><p class="docList">Getting the fundamental units right does not merely make
            individual tool usage better. It improves collaboration, because
            it gives the team members a common vocabulary for talking about
            the things they're working with.</p></li><li><p class="docList">When you see necessary tasks being repeatedly postponed
            ("I'll try to get to it this weekend &#8230; "), it's often a sign that
            the tools are forcing people into a higher per-task commitment
            level than they're comfortable with. Fix the tools and the
            postponements may go away.</p><p class="docList">The Contribulyzer didn't help with any of the interesting
            parts of evaluating a contributor's work: one still had to review
            the actual code changes, after all. But it did remove the
            <span class="docEmphasis">uninteresting</span> part, which was the manual
            search through the revision control logs for that contributor's
            changes. That dismaying prospect, although less work than the
            actual evaluation in most cases, was significant enough to be a
            gumption sink, in part because it's simply boring.</p><p class="docList">Removing it, and replacing it with a pleasant, lightweight
            interface, meant that team members no longer had to make an
            emotional commitment to a major effort when deciding to evaluate a
            contributor. Instead, it became like a decision to sharpen a
            pencil in an electric sharpener: there's no effort involved in
            starting up the task, you can stop in the middle and resume later
            if you want, and you can do as many pencils as you want without
            multiplying the start-up overhead.</p></li><li><p class="docList">When your team starts routing around the tools you've
            offered them, pay attention: it may be a sign that you're offering
            the wrong tools.</p><p class="docList">Not always, of course: there can be cases where people don't
            initially appreciate the benefits a tool will bring, and need to
            be taught. But even then, the tool is probably at least partly to
            blame, in that it didn't make the benefits clear enough from the
            outset. At the very least, grassroots workarounds should make you
            sit up and investigate what's motivating them. When the French
            translators of my book defected to a wiki-based interface, at
            considerable start-up cost to themselves, that was a clear sign
            that something was wrong with the interface I'd been
            providing.</p></li><li><p class="docList">A change in a team's demographics may require a change in
            tools.</p><p class="docList">With those XML book chapters, as long as the "team"
            consisted of programmers who had prior experience working with
            version-controlled XML files&mdash;which was the case for as long as the
            team consisted only of me&mdash;the tools I'd set up were fine. But when
            new people came on board, simply extending
            the existing framework was not the right answer. Instead, the tool
            environment needed to be rethought from scratch.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Partial automation is <a name="idx-CHP-21-0707"></a>often enough to make a difference.</p><p class="docList">Designers of <a name="idx-CHP-21-0708"></a>collaboration tools love 100% solutions: if
            something <span class="docEmphasis">can</span> be fully automated, they feel,
            then it should be. But in practice, it may not always be worth the
            effort; a hybrid model is often the better choice. If you can get
            90% of the benefit with 10% of the effort, then do just that much,
            and remember that the team is willing to make up the difference as
            long as they'll get clear benefits from it. The Contribulyzer, for
            example, completely depends on humans following certain crediting
            conventions when they write log messages. It takes time and effort
            to teach people these conventions. But the alternative&mdash;a fully
            automated intelligent project watcher that infers connections
            between mailing list messages and commits&mdash;would require a huge
            amount of effort with no guarantee of perfect reliability
            anyway.</p><p class="docList">Actually, that's one of the often overlooked benefits of
            hybrid tools: because they cause humans to stay engaged with the
            data at more points, such tools can prove
            <span class="docEmphasis">more</span> reliable than allegedly fully automated
            ones. The point of good tools is not to make humans unnecessary,
            but to make them happy. (Some might say "to make them more
            efficient," but an inefficient team is rarely happy anyway, and
            you surely wouldn't want a team that is efficient but
            unhappy.)</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">Despite the benefits to be had from good tools, my experience is
        that most teams' actual tool usage lags behind their potential tool
        usage. That is, most teams are failing to take advantage of
        potentially large multiplier effects. I think this is because of two
        built-in biases shared by most humans.</p>
<p class="docText">One bias is that trying new things costs too much. Since most
        new things are likely to bring little benefit, groups tend to be
        selective about adopting new tools, for the overhead of changing
        habits can be a drag on both productivity and enjoyment. (I do not
        mean to imply that this bias is unreasonable. Indeed, it is usually
        well founded, and I share it myself.)</p>
<p class="docText">The other bias is subtler. Because successful tools quickly
        become second nature&mdash;blending into the mental landscape until they are
        considered just part of "the way things are done"&mdash;people can easily
        forget the effect a tool had <span class="docEmphasis">at the time it was
        introduced</span>. Examples of this phenomenon are not hard to
        find, starting with the text editor in which I'm writing these words.
        Fifty years ago, the idea of editing and reshaping a text while
        simultaneously writing its first draft would have been a writer's
        wishful dream; <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-21-FNOTE-14">[]</a></sup> now it is so commonplace that it's probably hard for
        schoolchildren in the developed world to imagine writing any other
        way. And even computer text-editing starts to look like a mere
        incremental improvement when compared to a truly transformative tool
        like universal literacy.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-21-FNOTE-14">[]</a></sup> Whether it results in <span class="docEmphasis">better</span> text is,
            of course, open to question.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Imagine trying to get a team to cooperate
        without depending on its members being able to read and write!</p>
<p class="docText">And yet, consider how your team would react if someone came
        along and advocated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">I know a way to make you many times more productive. Do what I
          tell you, and your group's ability to collaborate will increase
          beyond your most optimistic projections. Here's the plan: first,
          everyone's going to learn this set of symbols, called an
          <span class="docEmphasis">alphabet</span>. Each symbol is called a
          <span class="docEmphasis">letter</span>, and the letters map, more or less, to
          sounds in a language that is native to some of you and non-native to
          others. Once you've learned the basic sounds of the letters, I'll
          show you how to arrange them in groups to form written words. Once
          you've memorized between 5,000 and 10,000 of those words, you'll be
          able to transmit arbitrary sentences, and then your productivity
          will increase by <span class="docEmphasis">a whole lot</span>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Literacy is a classic example of a high-investment, high-payoff
        tool. Everyone spends a lot of time in training, but after they make
        it through that part, it pays off for years to come.</p>
<p class="docText">Usually, the tools that get people most excited are
        low-investment, high-payoff. But it would be a mistake to consider
        only such tools: literacy did pay off in the end, after all. A
        dedicated team can make non-trivial tool investments when necessary,
        especially if everyone bears the burden together and thus is able to
        strengthen his sense of community by learning the new tool as a group.
        A tool that makes obstacles go away and makes new things possible will
        justify a lot of investment. For people working together on a
        technical project, few things have as direct an effect on daily
        experience as the tools they work with. The more you understand their
        experience, the better tool choices you can make.</p>
