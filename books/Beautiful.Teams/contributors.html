      developer training, product development, and R&amp;D. Mark began
      developing software as a way of financing a physics degree at Carnegie
      Mellon University. Sound advice from his advisor&mdash;"uh, I don't think you
      are cut out for academia"&mdash;and an inability to grow a respectable beard
      led to dropping physics and pursing software development as a career. In
      those classes, he learned that software development was part art, part
      science. In the real world, he learned it was actually a business. His
      dream is to one day live on his own Walden Pond with a high-speed
      Internet connection, of course.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor Field</span> is a British
      businessman with extensive experience in the outdoor advertising
      industry. He has also worked in the printing and publishing industries
      in South Africa and in the U.K.</p>
<p class="docText">In 1990, Trevor began developing the PlayPump
      system (<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.roundabout.co.za"></a>), an
      innovative water system that doubles as a water pump and merry-go-round
      for children. Over the next four years, he designed and built the first
      two PlayPumps that were installed in Masinga, a rural area of
      KwaZulu-Natal, a province of South Africa. In 1995, he decided to focus
      full time on the Roundabout PlayPump system. He joined forces with Paul
      Ristic in 1996, and in 1997, Roundabout Outdoor was founded. Roundabout
      Outdoor went on to win the inaugural World Bank Development Marketplace
      competition in 2000 for the PlayPump. The system has since achieved
      worldwide successes in other competitions, and has attracted donor
      funding (via the NGO, PlayPumps International) from all quarters; one of
      the most significant to date was the $16.4 million donation announced by
      First Lady Laura Bush at the Clinton Economic Forum in New York in
      September 2006. Trevor is currently working to expand the PlayPump model
      into the rest of Africa and the world. Thus far, more than 1,000
      PlayPumps have been installed in South Africa, Mozambique, Swaziland,
      Lesotho, and Zambia, with systems in other countries including Tanzania,
      Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia in development.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark Healey</span> is creative
      director at Media Molecule. He joined the games industry in 1988, and
      has established himself as one of the industry's most multitalented game
      developers. His main area of specialization is art, but during his
      career Mark has coded, designed, and contributed to game audio tracks.
      Mark joined Bullfrog Productions in 1994, and worked on some of its
      biggest hits, including <span class="docEmphasis">Theme Park, Magic Carpet</span>,
      and <span class="docEmphasis">Dungeonkeeper</span>. In 1997, he left Bullfrog to
      join Lionhead Studios, where he worked on <span class="docEmphasis">Black &amp;
      White</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">Fable</span>. His small contribution
      to the cult Internet title <span class="docEmphasis">Live for Speed</span> gave Mark
      a taste for development on a smaller scale. In 2002, he began work on
      his own game, <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll Kung Fu</span>, working on the
      game's graphics, code, design, and music with help from some friends.
      <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll Kung Fu's</span> blend of playability and
      off-the-wall humor proved to be a winning formula, and the game was
      nominated for the Develop Awards Best New PC IP and Innovation
      categories. The development and subsequent success of <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll
      King Fu</span> showed Mark that he worked best in a small, intense,
      but fun environment. Inspired by this, he formed a new development
      studio, Media Molecule, with the friends who had helped him make
      <span class="docEmphasis">Rag Doll Kung Fu</span> such a success: Alex Evans, David

      an attempt to understand why some projects are spectacular successes
      while many others fail to gain momentum. Having identified the key
      aspects that make an open source project successful, he moved on to
      Philips Medical Systems to deploy these key aspects, as the "inner
      source" approach, at a major product family program to improve the
      company's ability to collaborate across organizational boundaries and
      locations. In addition, he worked on evolving the division's software
      strategy, exploring if, why, when, and where open source solutions can
      be used to implement commodity parts of a product as viable alternatives
      to developing them yourself or buying them from a specialized third

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Dr. Karl Rehmer</span> spent several
      years teaching mathematics and computer science after earning a Ph.D. in
      mathematics. Leaving the academic world to get a job at a location where
      his wife could work on her Ph.D. in computer science, he joined
      Honeywell Air Transport Systems in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1988. While
      working there, he was a member of the HADS team that developed the
      software tools used to develop avionics software for the Boeing 777
      aircraft. Following that, Dr. Rehmer joined the
      Honeywell Research Center, where he developed the scheduler for the Deos
      real-time embedded operating system that has been used for many avionics
      applications. In 1996, he joined DDC-I, a vendor of software tools for
      the safety-critical market. He has been the chief architect of the DDC-I

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Eric Renkey</span> is a software
      developer who currently manages a small development team at an

      family's Atari 800 and has worked as an IT professional since 1995. He
      is a pleasure to work with, as he'll be happy to tell you. Eric received
      a B.A. in psychology from The Pennsylvania State University.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Ned Robinson</span> graduated from
      Hunter College's honors program (NYC) with a B.A. in English literature.
      As the computer revolution erupted in the 1980s, Ned decided to alter
      his career goals and taught himself how to program. At first, he
      programmed in Lotus 123 and dBase 3, but quickly progressed to C and
      C++. Ned worked for a variety of Wall Street banks until the early
      1990s. He then became a lead developer and product manager for Sheridan
      Software, a Microsoft ISV that specialized in value-added VBX and
      ActiveX solutions.</p>
<p class="docText">As a classically trained pianist, Ned was always interested in
      merging his technical abilities and his love of music. In 1995, he
      founded RePlay Technologies, a software company dedicated to the
      practicing musician. RePlay Technologies ran for five years before Ned
      sold it and returned to work in the financial district. It was at a
      small financial services software company that he met Andrew Stellman
      and, like Andrew, became an advocate for software process. Since he is a
      developer at heart, he sees process engineering as a way to give back to
      the development community, as good software process allows developers to
      really shine and exercise their incredible resourcefulness in bringing
      business requirements to life.</p>
