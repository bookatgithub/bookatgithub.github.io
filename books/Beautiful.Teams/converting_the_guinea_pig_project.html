<p class="docText">As we mentioned before, a project was assigned to use the new
        environment/tools being developed. The LAN idea was very welcomed, but
        the operating system (we were introducing Unix into a DEC VMS-oriented
        culture) and some of the new tools were not welcomed by all. To make
        it harder, the partner pilot project was using the <a name="idx-CHP-17-0506"></a>VMS operating system, which already came with a few good
        automated tools. Also, several personnel in the assigned project
        complained that Unix on the VAX ran much slower than did the VMS
        operating system. That was true, but they missed the fact that that
        was a development environment and that overall productivity was
        improved because the people were the more valuable resource at that
        point (they still had the mindset that machine time was more important
        than people time). Over the course of the project, some became
        converts, some never did.</p>
<p class="docText">What was interesting, however, was to observe how sometimes
        something very small can have a huge effect on <a name="idx-CHP-17-0507"></a>user acceptance. We have two examples to tell, both
        involving showing the value added in the new automation. The first one
        was about a secretary who typed most of the documents for the project
        and dealt with quite a few of the project personnel; many of the
        documents she typed had many equations for which she had to leave
        space to type, even if she used an automated word processor. That was
        both cumbersome and slow for her and her customers. Once she found out
        that Unix had the "eqn" tool that automated equations, she became a
        convert and was able to convert many more in her circle of work,
        including managers and system engineers, who were by then also being
        converted to use word processors. The other example was a savvy
        administrative assistant/data manager, who figured out she could
        automate some of their forms needs using Unix "scripts" as well as
        providing configuration management with the new tools; her boss was so
        impressed with the results that he mandated all his staff to use the
        system/tools. She used her creativity to solve a problem and had an
        open-minded boss who also dared to mandate (sometimes that is the only
        way to get some people to change).</p>
