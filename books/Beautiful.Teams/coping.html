<h3 id="title-IDAJ1P5L" class="docSection1Title">30.3. Coping</h3>
<p class="docText">My philosophy, as stated at the beginning of this chapter, is
        both <a name="idx-CHP-30-0920"></a>community-oriented and <a name="idx-CHP-30-0921"></a>process-oriented. It's community-oriented because I
        believe every success and failure can be exploited to improve team
        building, and process-oriented because I believe every project
        decision should take into account the way it treats team members and
        resources.</p>
<p class="docText">In earlier, sunnier times, our technical
        writing group once held a meeting (similar to many such <a name="idx-CHP-30-0922"></a>meetings held by Unix writers, I'm sure) about the
        reorganization of <a name="idx-CHP-30-0923"></a>manpages, which are an ungainly collection of historical
        Unix documentation. After some 45 minutes where we dissected the
        competing issues and established some precepts, I said, "The decision
        we eventually come up with is less important than the fact of our
        holding this conversation."</p>
<p class="docText">Some of the group were shocked by that luxurious approach to how
        we spent our time, but I believe it appealed to the technical writing
        manager, Alan. He talked regularly about bringing one's full self into
        the workplace, including one's emotional reactions and personal
        values. He once asked his staff to read a recently published
        management book whose central claim was that companies needed to be
        based on a vision in order to enjoy long-term success, and that this
        vision must pivot on some valuable contribution to customers, workers,
        or the larger society.</p>
<p class="docText">Alan designated me the team leader for the Longjump
        documentation&mdash;my first stint as a team leader, like George. I decided
        it was my job to protect my team as much as possible. We had no room
        to negotiate our workflows or deliverables. But I would try to save us
        from wasteful bureaucracy. Furthermore, I pledged to share with all
        the writers any information that could identify upcoming crises before
        they hit.</p>
<p class="docText">It turned out I had something to offer on the latter point. As
        team leader for the documentation, I attended <a name="idx-CHP-30-0924"></a>meetings throughout the software side of the project. I
        took meticulous notes and filtered them down to the items that I
        thought would have an impact on my fellow writers. I made sure all the
        writers on the train were offered a view as far ahead on the railroad
        tracks as any of us.</p>
<p class="docText">The aspect of team management that most engineers approach with
        a groan is regular meetings. At such meetings, typically, staff drone
        on about their accomplishments for the week and go back to their
        cubicles no more informed than before. For the Longjump writers, I
        announced that I would post an empty agenda each week and that we
        would hold a meeting next week only if someone added an item to the
        agenda.</p>
<p class="docText">This small innovation signaled my striving for both efficiency
        and democracy. Writers thanked me for eliminating pointless meetings.
        However, any writer had the power to call a meeting simply by posting
        an agenda item.</p>
<p class="docText">In practice, I was the only person to post agenda items. When we
        did have meetings, I reported news of specific interest to the group,
        and we were usually finished in 15 minutes. We didn't use any cool
        Scrum-like techniques, but we hit on our own formula for maximizing
        the value of our time together.</p>
