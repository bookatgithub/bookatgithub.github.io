<p class="docText">Few people in the software industry are as widely recognized for
        their work as Grady Booch. His work with Rational and IBM helped guide
        the industry in both object-oriented development and process
        improvement with the <a name="idx-CHP-9-0235"></a>Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the <a name="idx-CHP-9-0236"></a>Rational Unified Process (RUP). Lately, he's done a lot
        of work with distributed teams and platforms. We started our
        conversation with him there.</p>
</td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Tell us a little bit about
      what you did in the past that taught you about how teams
      work</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: Wow. Great question. You
      know, from the very beginning of my professional career, I was involved
      with some <a name="idx-CHP-9-0237"></a>distributed teams. The very first project I was engaged
      with was when I was actually still in the Air Force. My first assignment
      was at Vandenberg Air Force Base, where I was first a project engineer
      for a telemetry system and then a project manager for a range safety
      system. In each of those cases, we were dealing with a really
      distributed system. This was back in the late '70s, early '80s. It was
      really ahead of its time from a commercial perspective, because we were
      dealing with the fusion of sensor data from radar sites around the
      world. So, that in itself led me to some experiences with how one deals
      with the architecture of distributed systems. And additionally, the
      people who were building these systems, most of them were collocated in
      the Vandenberg Air Force Base area, but we had groups that were
      scattered about because of the distributed nature of the system itself.
      Indeed, on the range safety display system, which was the one I was a
      project manager for, we eventually coordinated with groups at the
      Kennedy Center, so we were across the country in that case. So very,
      very early on, I was used to development across geographic time
      zones.</p>
<p class="docText">Then, when Rational began, my focus was mostly on architectural
      issues. I helped most of our customers deal with the transition from
      waterfall methods to more agile methods and also from monolithic
      architectures to looser architectures. It really was about 10, 15 years
      ago that I began to see a sea change among the customers I was working
      with. Many of their projects no longer fit in the same building or the
      same company. And you saw, for economic reasons, outsourcing or
      near-shoring to break up the team. Also, they were building systems
      assistants, which meant that their teams were not just the one team on a
      particular part of the system, but they were dealing with teams across
      the country or the world. Even more so, as I began to work with
      multinational corporations, you were dealing with systems that involve
      different companies as well. So, the natural progression of both the
      technology&mdash;the kinds of systems we were building&mdash;and the economics had
      led to natural pressures which meant organizations are distributing both
      in time and in space. And it's those experiences that really shaped my
      worldview.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, what's the hardest thing about working with
      a distributed team: different locations, different personalities, or
      different technologies?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: It's interesting you
      point that out, because there are some technical issues that are still
      wickedly hard, which are the problems of coordinating management across
      time zones. But I think the really difficult ones have nothing to do
      with technology, but have everything to do with social issues. I'd put
      those in two categories: one is the issue of <a name="idx-CHP-9-0238"></a>trust, and the other is cultural differences.</p>
<p class="docText">On the issue of <a name="idx-CHP-9-0239"></a>trust, if I have a group that is geographically
      distributed and I may not be working with them face to face, it's
      difficult to calibrate their abilities and how they're going to react or
      how I'm going to work with them. It's very different than when I'm
      working in the same room with them and can see them on a day-to-day
      basis. This is called the "<a name="idx-CHP-9-0240"></a>water cooler problem" because, when you have a distributed
      situation like that, there's no opportunity for serendipitous
      connections, and those kinds of very loose, opportunistic connections
      are very important in building trust.</p>
<p class="docText">On a <a name="idx-CHP-9-0241"></a>cultural perspective, if I'm dealing with systems across
      countries, then the <a name="idx-CHP-9-0242"></a>culture of developing on the West Coast is subtly
      different from the East Coast view, which is very different than that in
      India, in China, and in Japan, and so there are subtle things that go on
      that add friction to the development process.</p>
<p class="docText">So, I'd say that those two, the issues of trust and cultural
      dislocation, are the most difficult to overcome.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: What does it look like when trust doesn't work on
      a team that's distributed, as opposed to one that's working in the same
      location?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: Well, you know, it
      smells much the same if the team doesn't trust one another, whether
      they're collocated or not. If they're collocated and they don't trust
      one another, then politics get very, very nasty because they're
      immediate. If they're distributed, you get more of this
      passive-aggressive behavior, where you sort of ignore the other group
      and just get things done and eventually certain groups become polarized
      and eventually disenfranchised.</p>
<p class="docText">And you <span class="docEmphasis">can</span> really smell that lack of trust.
      I mean, I've smelled it in teams that were collocated, and you just go
      in and you can feel the tension and hate among one another. And nothing
      gets done very well. There was a great article, an interview with Andy
      Hertzfeld recently about his experience with the Mac. He observed, and
      I'm paraphrasing, that conventional processes lead to conventional
      products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, because there are many
      conventional products to build, but if you're in a space that's doing
      some tremendous innovation, and you don't have a culture of trust, then
      that innovation is going to just suffer, absolutely.</p>
<p class="docText">So, how does one build that kind of thing? Well, I'm going to
      mention some exotic ideas, some exotic to simple ideas. The simple ideas
      are: occasionally, you do need to get people together. Having, in a
      distributed team, some way that I can get people together at least once
      really helps, or in a periodic way, moving people back and forth. On the
      more exotic side, there's been some interesting work in the virtual
      worlds in IBM, where people have built Outward Bound-type programs
      inside the virtual world, so that teams working together, although
      distributed, can work on a common task that has nothing to do with
      software development, but they learn about one another that way.</p>
<p class="docText">It's those kinds of things that can build that opportunity for
      trust. But it doesn't really deal with the <a name="idx-CHP-9-0243"></a>water cooler problem, because with the <a name="idx-CHP-9-0244"></a>water cooler problem, you need to create environments
      where people can serendipitously get together. This is why, on video
      conferences and phone calls, it's really not a bad thing to get the
      chatter before and after: "Hey, how's your day, how's your kid, how's
      your dog?" These things really help humanize the whole process&mdash;and
      ultimately, software development is a human experience. And insofar as
      you can bring that human experience to the table, then trust can find
      its own way.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What about dealing with
      developers who just want to bury their noses and really would prefer if
      nobody talked to them ever and they could just be left alone to code? It
      sounds like you'd have to approach the whole trust issue differently
      with different kinds of people</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-9-0245"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: Absolutely. And you do
      need code warriors like that, who just totally go heads-down. But you
      have to be careful about them: you need to channel them, you need to
      interest them, and you need to keep them excited about what they're
      doing. In fact, the best thing you can do in those circumstances is to
      get out of their way. But you can't do it in a totally hands-off
      fashion, because they'll go off and build things that are absolutely
      fascinating but useless to the business. And so there is this balance
      one has to have between respecting the work style of individuals, but
      also the needs of the business itself. And any good manager is going to
      recognize those differences among individuals.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What if you're on a team where you're a
      developer and you're not sure how to work with someone like
      that?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: In those circumstances,
      you find places for common agreement. If I'm working with someone who is
      just a heads-down, code-warrior kind of guy, <a name="idx-CHP-9-0246"></a>antisocial perhaps even to a degree, I have to find a
      common ground upon which we can work. That might be some wicked piece of
      code I'll try to engage him on. Also, as a developer in those spaces,
      I'll often try to draw them out beyond where they're heads-down about
      and say, "Hey, have you looked at this in the real world?" Because such
      people are a delight to have, but if they're going to be an enduring
      jewel for your organization, you have to make sure you feed them
      constantly, too. And that kind of feeding helps build trust.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, a lot of this is sort of "care and feeding
      of the software team" fundamentals</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: There are days when I
      swear I need to be Dr. Phil. It is more of a sociological issue than it
      is a technical issue&mdash;not that there aren't technical <a name="idx-CHP-9-0247"></a>issues, but the sociological issues as you start moving to
      <a name="idx-CHP-9-0248"></a>teams of size become more and more important.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Jenny and I have both been in the position of
      trying to grow teams that hit that wall of three or four or five
      people&mdash;trying to get past that barrier and build teams of 10, 20, 30,
      50, 80. How have you handled it? Has it always worked out well for
      you?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: Oh, not always. I
      couldn't give you a percentage, but some teams just simply don't fit
      together&mdash;it's true not only in technology but in any kind of
      organization. Some teams gel, some teams don't. And the key is to
      provide the mechanisms, and those teams will find their way. If you have
      <a name="idx-CHP-9-0249"></a>too heavy of a hand in terms of process, then there's no
      room whatsoever for people to self-organize. But if you make it too
      loose, there's no organization and no degree of predictability. All of
      us have to realize that some people really, really do like structure.
      This is what attracts people to large organizations and makes them shy
      away from start-ups. At the same time, the mentality you need in a
      start-up, where you have no legacy strangling you, is a very, very
      different kind of mentality than if you're going to maintain that. And
      the people who often build things initially often get really bored
      quickly and really don't like maintaining the same code for years and
      years and years, and yet the business goes on beyond that.</p>
<p class="docText">This brings up another problem in the space, which is one that I
      call <a name="idx-CHP-9-0250"></a>tribal memory. Every <a name="idx-CHP-9-0251"></a>system has an architecture: most of them are accidental,
      only a few of them are intentional. And what I mean by this is that the
      architecture that we end up with is really borne from the tens of
      thousands of small decisions made on a daily basis. You wake up one day
      and you say, "This is what I have." Not to single Google out anymore,
      but they're in the same situation. They're saying, "We had no legacy
      when we started the company, and now we've got this marvelous system and
      we've dominated the marketplace," and they have made certain
      architectural decisions for their cloud that are very different than
      Amazon's cloud, that are very different from IBM's cloud, and yet
      they've made those investments so their architecture is what it is. And
      now as people move on, you have this interesting issue of that
      architecture, those details, are rarely left in the documentation, there
      often is no documentation, and though the code is the truth, it's not
      the whole truth, because it doesn't capture things like rationale and
      trade-off, nor does it capture things that are difficult to discern at
      the individual lines of code; they're the patterns that transcend the
      lines of code itself. That kind of stuff is kept in <a name="idx-CHP-9-0252"></a>tribal memory. And so you'll find these tribal elders
      within an organization who've been around for a while, and they
      understand that rationale and those cross-cutting concerns. The
      challenge is, as the organization continues to grow, these people move
      on, and that IP is often walked out the door, literally.</p>
<p class="docText">So, the challenge is, in addition to the problems of temporal and
      geographic distribution, that you also have to deal with intellectual
      property leakage, because having it kept in tribal memory is very, very
      expensive&mdash;well, actually, it's very inexpensive, but it's very expensive
      to extract it, and it's very, very expensive when it leaves.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Is it feasible to extract it? Is it feasible to
      actually take these busy people and say, "Hey, let's write down the
      rationale for this piece of software?"</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: Absolutely. I have a
      circumstance where I was working with a state office on the East Coast
      where they said, "We have these curious demographics: we've got these
      really young folks right out of college, we've got these older folks,
      and there's nobody in the middle, because they've heard the siren song
      of Manhattan and gone off to Wall Street." And now the older people are
      retiring and dying&mdash;not necessarily in that order&mdash;so my recommendation
      was to do oral histories. Get video cameras. Interview them and find out
      where the skeletons lie. Even something as light touch as that really
      helps.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: I want to bring it back to what you said about
      rationale in the code and how people are making their decisions within
      the team. What do you think of criticism within a team and how do you
      handle that in a distributed team? Also, a lot of what process is about
      is helping people to understand how they fit in and be transparent with
      one another. How do you think that works with a distributed
      team?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: That's a great question,
      and I think this is a case where you really need to have the mechanisms
      for the team to find its own way. I really liked the phrase you used
      there, and I'll rephrase it by saying something to
      the effect that the ideal developing environment is one that produces a
      frictionless environment, meaning that it allows you to collect
      information with minimal intervention by the developers themselves,
      insofar as I can instrument my change management systems to do things
      for me, insofar as I can instrument my tests to do daily builds and
      things like that; this is the kind of stuff that needs to be shown in
      the tools, because it allows tasks to be automated to a degree that gets
      out of the way of the individual developers themselves. And yet, as you
      point out, there will be points of tension, and there will be times when
      one has to make some hard decisions. In a team that has no visible
      leader, this can often be very, very painful because egos run high and
      you see a lot of tension. But ultimately, in most healthy <a name="idx-CHP-9-0253"></a>teams, you do find some centers of gravity and knowledge.
      They can be self-appointed because of their experience. A good example
      of this is Linus <a name="idx-CHP-9-0254"></a>Torvalds and the whole <a name="idx-CHP-9-0255"></a>Linux project. He has risen as the intellectual leader in
      that space because he began it, but it's not just Linus. There are
      people that also drive elements of the kernel itself, and they have,
      through their experience, earned the right to do so and earned the
      respect, too. And the same thing happens in any gelled team.</p>
<p class="docText">As you grow larger and larger, these kinds of roles have to be
      institutionalized. This is why you see people getting the role of
      "senior designer" or "architect" or, in larger systems, you see someone
      who's an architect for a whole group, or for the company as a whole. In
      fact, there are these growing patterns of where the center of control
      lies as you move toward less rapid development, where there's a
      tremendous amount of innovation but you're also throwing away lots of
      code, to the point where the code begins to accumulate, becomes a
      capital investment, and becomes part of something of the <a name="idx-CHP-9-0256"></a>culture itself that you can't just throw away anymore. And
      you have to institutionalize some of that decision-making
      process.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: You've been talking about the people on the team,
      but what about the team as a whole? What do you think are the top
      characteristics of a well-run team?</span><a name="idx-CHP-9-0257"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: Well, I'll give you two
      that I think are the most important to me. And they're the things I can
      really smell when I go into a group. The top characteristic is that
      they're having fun. You can really tell, when you go into a group, if
      they're enjoying each other and enjoying what they're doing. That's a
      clear measure that this is a team that's working well.</p>
<p class="docText">And the second is that they're wonderfully reactive, but at the
      same time, they're producing code that meets the needs of the business.
      This is the difficult balance that I spoke of earlier. You can have
      small teams that are just running totally unconstrained and having a
      hell of a lot of fun just burning up other people's money and not doing
      anything useful, but a group that does understand its business's needs
      and communicates and does what it does well in building code&mdash;that's the
      other side. They're building good code for the business.</p>
<p class="docText">So, those are the two things that I think are the most important.
      And everything else, frankly, in my mind, is just a minor measure below
      that. There are lots of detailed measures, but those are the big
      ones.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That's a tall order. A lot
      of people have probably been on teams that have been fun to work on; not
      that many could say that those teams were really
      productive.</span><a name="idx-CHP-9-0258"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: They tend to cancel each other
      out.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Yeah&mdash;how do you keep that from
      happening?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: The magic is hard to
      create, and it's something that comes and goes. Xerox PARC, in its time,
      was such a magical place, although they kind of failed on the equation
      of trying to make money about it. I think Apple is in a place, right
      now, where many of their developers are having fun and they're just
      going gangbusters in the marketplace. Google, in its earlier days, was a
      place with more emphasis on fun, and they made more money than God, so
      you didn't notice the inefficiencies&mdash;now it's going to become more
      challenging. IBM's a company that emphasizes the business to the extent
      of fun, but you still find lots of pockets of fun where people are
      gelling and loving what they do.</p>
<p class="docText">So, I don't know how you do it. You're asking me, in a sense, what
      are the rules that produce this kind of emergent behavior. And if I knew
      the answer to that, I'd own a small country.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: There won't be rules, but there are things you
      can do to nudge your team or your culture in the right
      direction.</span><a name="idx-CHP-9-0259"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: Sure. And I'll mention
      two of them here.</p>
<p class="docText">One is to make certain that they get out a bit. In other words,
      you find groups that are heads-down in the code itself, and that's
      wonderful because you need people that are skilled in the tools
      themselves. But ultimately, we're building code to fill some need, and
      we need to make certain that the team is not insulated, not totally
      isolated. I think that's an important one because it gives them a
      context and rationale for what they're doing.</p>
<p class="docText">The second thing you have to do, especially as a project manager,
      is shield them from the rest of the world. There's a lot of really
      crappy politics that goes on with some companies. And for a team to
      obsess over the daily machinations of what goes on in the political
      structure&mdash;they're just going to be worried to death. And so a good
      project manager has to be a shield between the developers and the
      politics of an organization.</p>
<p class="docText">And in some cases, as I said earlier, the best thing a manager can
      do is to make certain that you get everybody out of these people's way.
      It's simple things like managing the stupid meetings that the
      organization requires as it grows&mdash;but at the same time, you don't want
      to make them unconstrained. It's like, Nerf Wars in the hallways are
      fun, too, but you want to make sure these people are <a name="idx-CHP-9-0260"></a>focused.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: And how does a manager make sure the people on
      the team are focused?</span><a name="idx-CHP-9-0261"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: Three things come to
      mind. One is that the best leaders I've found in this space tend to be
      really articulate. They can write great code, but they can also talk to
      people outside that space&mdash;they can rise above the code itself.</p>
<p class="docText">The second is they do care about <a name="idx-CHP-9-0262"></a>interpersonal relationships. The best leaders, I find, are
      not just total gear heads, but people who really do understand the human
      experience in building software and respect that, too. People have off
      days&mdash;their dog dies, their kid's having problems in school, these are
      all things that affect the development team. A good leader understands
      these human issues.</p>
<p class="docText">Third, a good leader is able to work at many levels of abstraction
      simultaneously. A person who can go down to the code, then go up and
      talk to the CEO, these people are very rare indeed, but they're the best
      kind of leaders that I can find because they provide that
      context.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It's funny that you say that, because a lot of
      times, especially early in my career, I've been on a team and thought
      that to myself, "I'm just not speaking the same language as the people
      above me." I definitely needed a "translator," and I think maybe I
      started out a manager simply because I had to rise to the occasion out
      of sheer frustration. What would you say to somebody else, somebody who
      finds himself thrust into that role because nobody else will fill
      it?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: I always give this
      advice to such a person: please take on that role gently and without
      arrogance, because you're dealing oftentimes with people who are highly
      technically skilled, who have a certain amount of ego, and the thing
      that's going to irritate them the most is that sense of arrogance
      without any kind of respect. So, move into such roles gently. But do so
      boldly, and don't be afraid <a name="idx-CHP-9-0263"></a>to fail.</p>
<p class="docText">Another thing that one needs to grow to in that space, and I know
      it's difficult for somebody starting out, because your very livelihood
      is at risk, but you really want to be in a position where you can speak
      truth to power&mdash;where you can say to management, "That is the most insane
      schedule possible, and no human on earth can do this. It is
      unrealistic." You have to be truthful; otherwise, your whole process
      becomes a series of lies built atop one another. Speaking truth to power
      is important. That's another aspect of <a name="idx-CHP-9-0264"></a>shielding your team from the strange politics that go
      on.</p>
<p class="docText">But it's difficult to stand up, because sometimes management
      doesn't even understand the process of developing software. Software, to
      them, is just another huge cost item in the organization, and they'd
      prefer to outsource it all. In that case, the leader has to be one who
      also gently educates upper management, and that's a long process. And,
      if you fail, you can always find another job: life's too short to work
      for a crappy organization.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It's funny&mdash;Jenny and I spend a lot of time
      talking to people in a lot of different companies about why projects
      fail. In fact, we put together a talk called "Why Projects Fail" and
      took it on the road. And what we keep finding over and over again is
      that people get really uncomfortable when they hear people talking about
      failure. That's a shame, because I think they need to start talking
      about failure if they're going to learn from it. Have you noticed
      that?</span><a name="idx-CHP-9-0265"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: One of the signs that I
      have for the health of an organization is that they're reticent to fail.
      Organizations that are totally anal and refuse to fail at all tend to be
      the least innovative organizations, and they're hardly any fun, because
      these people are so fearful of failing they take the most conservative
      actions. On the other hand, organizations that are
      freer in failing, not in a way that will destroy the business, but are
      given some freedom to fail, are the ones that are more productive,
      because they're not in fear for their life with every line of code.
      Because, you know, every line of code you write, it's going to be wrong.
      You have to have the opportunity to refactor it over time.</p>
<p class="docText">This is a big problem for organizations transitioning from
      building something that doesn't have a <a name="idx-CHP-9-0266"></a>legacy to having a legacy. I've seen this scenario happen
      so many times. You get a group&mdash;especially if they're using something
      lightweight like Ruby on Rails&mdash;and they have no legacy whatsoever. Maybe
      there's a database out there, but somebody says "go build X" and they go
      build X because they have nothing else that they have to work with.
      Maybe there are a few services or APIs, but they're pretty much running
      across virgin territory. The problem is that starts accumulating. Every
      line of code I write today becomes tomorrow's legacy. And you get to the
      point where you say, "Gee, I can blow this up and start over," but then
      you get to a point where you say, "I can't blow this up anymore, there's
      so much stuff here. I simply can't rewrite all of this." And you get to
      the point where you realize you have some choices. One is to abandon the
      code and start over, and that's rarely useful because you never get the
      behavior you want. Another choice is to isolate it and put some wrappers
      around it and say, "Let's leave it off in a corner here, it works well
      enough, we'll get to it eventually," although you never do get to it.
      There are other cases where you might want to harvest it: "Throw it
      away, but harvest the best things we can do, and rewrite it, although
      not from scratch."</p>
<p class="docText">Enduring organizations I encounter tend to refactor on a
      continuous basis, not just at the programmatic level, but at the
      architectural level as well. But that's a challenge because your upper
      organization will say, "We paid for this code already, why are we
      rewriting it?" And the answer is that we're doing it to make it simpler,
      which will give us opportunities for innovation and degrees of freedom
      we could not have had otherwise. But that's a tough sell, and that's
      part of the education process that I spoke of earlier.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: I suspect there are people who will see the word
      "refactoring" and immediately jump to agile development. Is that what
      you mean here? What does that mean for a team's
      productivity?</span><a name="idx-CHP-9-0267"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Grady</span>: It's just a label, for
      me, for some best practices I've seen here for a long time. No matter
      what label you give it, the <a name="idx-CHP-9-0268"></a>best process that I've seen hyper-productive organizations
      across domains tend to follow is this, in three parts. These are
      organizations that tend to incrementally and iteratively produce
      releases of executable architectures. So, what are the three
      pieces?</p>
<p class="docText">First, a focus on executables. Pushing out raw code as your
      primary product, that's the most important thing, and that's obviously
      an agile process. Second, doing so incrementally and iteratively means
      you have some regular rhythms, where you can introduce refactoring, in
      which you have an opportunity for failing a little bit along the way and
      have parallel paths that let you try things. The third element, which is
      less so one of the agile community and more one of the RUP community, is
      a focus on <a name="idx-CHP-9-0269"></a>architecture as a means of governance. Because, from my
      experience, as I start dealing with systems of any kind
      of meaningful intellectual or physical size, there become a set of
      accumulated design decisions that are part of the tribal memory, and
      it's very expensive, if not impossible, for me to throw those decisions
      away and start over. And so what I tend to govern on, as I grow the
      system over time, is preserving those architectural decisions so I don't
      end up with a totally random piece of software, but I end up with one
      that's intentional over time.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, call it agile, call it whatever you want, those are the
      practices that I find to be consistent among the really hyper-productive
      teams.</p>
