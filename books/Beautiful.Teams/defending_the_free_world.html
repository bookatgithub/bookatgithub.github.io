<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Start off by telling me a
      little bit about Northrop: how you came to be there, and how you came to
      learn about how teams work</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-13-0332"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: Northrop Grumman is one
      of the key participants in the U.S. <a name="idx-CHP-13-0333"></a>defense and aerospace industry, with many important
      contributions over the years. The company took its current form over the
      last 10 years through a series of mergers, bringing together a set of
      synergistic companies with long and proud legacies of accomplishment. We
      think of ourselves as a "company of immigrants," respecting those
      legacies and achievements, while at the same time trying to combine our
      skills into something synergistic that is better than ever. My current
      job is sector vice president for Technology and Advanced Systems; I've
      been doing that for about seven years. Before that, I ran one of the
      businesses within the company, called Tactical Systems. Tactical Systems
      created vital, life-saving capabilities for the U.S. military&mdash;what the
      military calls "battle command" and "command-and-control" systems,
      primarily for the Army, but also for the other military services.
      Tactical Systems was a very successful business organization, which grew
      on average 25% a year during each of the seven years that I ran
      it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And what kind of projects did you work
      on?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: We built equipment that
      allowed our soldiers to communicate and coordinate on the battlefield,
      to know where everyone (friend and enemy) was, to make and share plans,
      and to monitor the execution of those plans. It was a very team-oriented
      business; 50% of our revenue was derived from vendors and subcontracts,
      which meant that we had not only to build effective teams inside the
      company and with our customers, but also with a large number of other
      companies. Interestingly, the typical contract inside the company at the
      time had 70% or 80% of the content done by our own company, so this was
      an organization that depended very heavily on its ability to form teams
      not just with other parts of our own company but with other companies.
      And that was a lot of fun, and yet at the same time, very hard.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What made it hard? What's harder about working
      with teams from a bunch of different companies?</span><a name="idx-CHP-13-0334"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: It's about achieving
      <a name="idx-CHP-13-0335"></a>alignment of objectives. Everybody has their own set of
      motivations and goals, and it's very rare, even inside the company, for
      two different people or two different organizations to have exactly the
      same motivations and goals. But this potential for <a name="idx-CHP-13-0336"></a>misalignment of motivations and goals is even more
      exaggerated when you are working with people from other companies. For
      example, you might team with companies that would actually prefer that
      they were in charge of the job; for various reasons, you are able to
      talk them into being your subcontractor to team together for a job, but
      maybe there's the thought in their minds through the whole job that they
      could have just gone off and won this by themselves &#8230; and then they
      would be the prime contractor! In any case, there are always factors
      like, "We want to have a little more credit", or "We want to have a
      little more visibility", or "We want to have a little more work", or
      "Why is she giving the work to this other party? We could do that
      better."</p>
<p class="docText">So, all those things that are perfectly
      normal even inside one company are all magnified a little bit when you
      are <a name="idx-CHP-13-0337"></a>partnering with other companies, because every work
      assignment has to be done as a subcontract, or as a teaming
      agreement&mdash;every aspect of the relationship is controlled by a very
      formal business arrangement. Every issue is resolved through formal
      negotiation, <a name="idx-CHP-13-0338"></a>and the resolution documented through modifications to the
      subcontract. Actually, in some sense, there's an advantage inherent to
      using outside partners, because it forces you into that formality, which
      gives you the possibility of eliminating <a name="idx-CHP-13-0339"></a>ambiguity in what you've agreed to, and <a name="idx-CHP-13-0340"></a>ambiguity can be a real enemy to effective team operation.
      Ambiguity is a major source of conflict, due to mismatch of
      expectations.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That sounds like a delicate balancing act. I get
      the sense that you had to learn that the hard way. Not a lot of people
      get the opportunity in their careers to learn a lesson like that. How
      did you learn that?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: Let me go back a little
      bit in time to when I was running the Tactical Systems division. We bid
      and won a large Army program, and we produced a very important
      war-fighting system (one that is still in use); I think at the time we
      submitted the proposal we had about 10 companies on our team. Some of
      these companies were providing what you might call components: they were
      very specialized, they had very clear scope, and as a result there was
      little conflict, little ambiguity about how we would work together on
      this job. But others of those companies viewed themselves as generalists
      who could bring a full range of capabilities to the partnership, and yet
      to be a part of a team that large, they had to narrow their scope to do
      just one or two specific things. As a result, some of those companies
      came to the party with the feeling that they'd subverted their ambitions
      so as to increase their likelihood of a win, and while that made sense
      intellectually, emotionally many of them felt like there were additional
      pieces of work on the job that they could do and would like to do. So,
      there was really a possibility for misalignment, and even
      conflict.</p>
<p class="docText">It was a very exciting activity&mdash;first of all, to talk all these
      companies into being your subcontractor rather than submitting prime
      contractor bids competing against you, or teaming with some other
      bidder. You basically have to convince them that their total expected
      financial and strategic return is higher because the probability of win
      is higher. Maybe their work share&mdash;the dollar value of work they'll do&mdash;is
      smaller, but the probability of win is so much higher that the total
      financial package is better for them. That's a hard sell, at
      times.</p>
<p class="docText">And then, when you have so many companies on one team&mdash;and in this
      instance, for various reasons, that was really necessary&mdash;then obviously
      none of these companies could be doing a very large portion of the total
      job; they start asking, "OK, I'm good at that, but I'm also good at
      these other things, so why aren't I doing that? Why have you given that
      work to this other company?" So, it's a real negotiation challenge; you
      have to get everybody aligned and working toward the main goal (and
      continuously keep them aligned!), and then you have to get everybody
      motivated, because this team might have 10 companies on it, but it has
      to look to the customer as one team.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I've never had to deal with
      a project team as complex as one with people from 10 different
      companies, but I definitely recognize the need to get people aligned and
      motivated. How do you do that?</span><a name="idx-CHP-13-0341"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: In our business, we have
      some advantages and we have some disadvantages. The first thing that we
      do in the <a name="idx-CHP-13-0342"></a>defense business to get people aligned and motivated is
      sell our <a name="idx-CHP-13-0343"></a>mission: we are defending the free world. I was the
      general manager of this business throughout the dot-com boom. The
      dot-com boom created a huge demand for technical talent. Recruiting
      talented software people for our company became a big issue because the
      dot-com boom was sucking up a lot of talent and paying very high
      salaries. And so I used that opportunity to recruit shamelessly, based
      on the value of our customers' mission. I would say things like, "You're
      a talented software person. You could go to work for a telecom company,
      and <a name="idx-CHP-13-0344"></a>your life's work could be routing telephone calls
      successfully. Or you can come to work for us and maybe we won't pay you
      quite as much&mdash;although none of our employees starve&mdash;but you'll be saving
      the free world."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I can see how that would be a motivator&mdash;not for
      everyone, but definitely for the kind of person you'd want working
      there. Did it take a lot of work to find those people?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: It's kind of a
      self-selection process. The people who resonated with that motivation
      came to work for me. The people who were absolutely out to get the best
      salary offer didn't come to work for me. I had a strategy of trying to
      pay just a few percent less than the prevailing wage in our area so that
      I would be picking off those people who resonated with our customers'
      mission, playing to one of the natural strengths our industry has: we do
      something that's important and easy to explain. We also do something
      that's interesting. I view it as every bit as interesting as the telecom
      companies or Microsoft&mdash;that's a personal judgment&mdash;but it's most
      definitely interesting. It's high-tech, very leading-edge. So, I could
      really play on the combination of <span class="docEmphasis">important,
      interesting</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">reasonably
      compensated</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">So, the people who joined my team had self-selected against those
      criteria. This is important: the first vector of alignment wasn't around
      our company, and wasn't around me, but was around "here's a way to
      contribute to national defense." This particular program had very high
      visibility in the Army&mdash;we routinely met with the chief of staff of the
      Army, and so forth; this made working on this program a very visible
      opportunity to do something that was clearly important. Furthermore, the
      Army was trying to do this reasonably fast. When you're trying to do
      something big in the defense industry, sometimes it takes seven years,
      or 10 years, or longer; it takes seven years to build an aircraft
      carrier. But the government wanted to do this particular innovation much
      faster than normal. So, not only could you do something interesting and
      important, but you could also get to the job satisfaction of seeing the
      thing done in about three years.</p>
<p class="docText">That gave me an opportunity to create alignment around these
      bigger-than-us factors like national defense, and the United States
      Army, and the first-ever digitization of the battlefield, and saving
      soldiers' lives, and saving marines' lives. That provided a strong
      message around which to start a process of reaching alignment within our
      team. I suspect that this might not translate so
      directly to other fields, but <a name="idx-CHP-13-0345"></a>with a little bit of creativity, almost every business has
      something about their business that is essential and important in some
      way.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I'm actually a little surprised by the fact that
      what you just said is very similar to what I've heard from open source
      people: a feeling of working toward a higher cause. Your higher cause is
      life-and-death, but for a lot of us, I suspect we can still find that
      kind of motivation in our own projects. What do you
      think?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: National <a name="idx-CHP-13-0346"></a>defense is a very tangible thing, but I suspect that many
      fields have some aspect that can be important. For example, <a name="idx-CHP-13-0347"></a>working for the electric company can be important, because
      delivering uninterrupted, reliable electric service is important. One
      can create an ethos within your team that what they are doing is vital
      to the community. There's probably something in every industry that you
      can attack from that angle.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, let's get back to those 10 companies you had
      to balance. How did you do it? I can see how you'd motivate your
      individual team members, but how do you keep all of these companies
      working toward the same goal?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: There are some obvious
      things that they want: they want revenue, they want profit margin, and
      they want predictability. But those are really, in my experience, weak
      things to build alignment around. The better thing is, "What are the
      strategic goals of that company?" If you're dealing with people at a
      sufficiently high level in your partner companies, you can have
      discussions about what the strategic goals are and what you can
      do&mdash;things that may or may not have to do with near-term revenue&mdash;that can
      maybe help reinforce a capability that five years from now will be
      strategically important to them.</p>
<p class="docText">So, one spends a lot of time trying to understand the strategic
      goals of your partner companies. It's a little difficult, in that
      they're not going to tell you everything, because you're still potential
      competitors on other jobs. But just ask what makes them tick, what their
      strategic goals are, and what you can do that will not only satisfy
      their near-term need of revenue and jobs, but will also create strategic
      value out of the relationship. Even just the act of asking such a
      question and listening to their answer, engaging in dialog, is creating
      an air of respect: a sense that this project isn't just about me and my
      glory, or maximizing the glory and revenue of my company, but includes
      them, too. And that's obviously a long, slow process&mdash;one conversation is
      never a basis for building a relationship of trust&mdash;but it's a very
      tangible thing. You can find mutually agreeable things in a teaming
      relationship that create strategic value for the partners.</p>
<p class="docText">And that works for partners, and also with other organizations
      within our own company. The nature of the discussions with organizations
      inside our own company is maybe a little different&mdash;there's actually a
      perverse clarity that comes with having these discussions with other
      companies&mdash;but if you look like you're trying to reach beyond the obvious
      work scope and revenue, and trying to make this work for them in a
      longer-term strategic sense, that can create a lot of satisfaction in
      the teaming arrangement, even if the immediate revenue is less than that
      for which they hoped.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I'm really interested in
      the day-to-day of what it's like working on one of your projects. I
      assume that you guys have to go through a pretty big
      information-gathering phase at the beginning of a project, talking to
      the guys who are actually using what you'll be working on. Can you tell
      me a little bit about how that works?</span><a name="idx-CHP-13-0348"></a><a name="idx-CHP-13-0349"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: First of all, this
      information gathering is a huge opportunity for realizing the alignment
      that I talked about first, the alignment around the mission. Because
      really, this is a chance to get people seduced and resonating
      emotionally with the mission of the users. The officers in the U.S.
      <a name="idx-CHP-13-0350"></a>military are, in general, extremely capable and motivated
      people who are great representatives of their mission. It's wonderful
      for me to be able to connect our people with them.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Are they good to work with? What's it like
      working with them?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: They're a good customer!
      They believe in their mission, and know how to talk about that. Of
      course, the U.S. military is an even bigger bureaucracy than <a name="idx-CHP-13-0351"></a>Northrop Grumman; we're a hundred thousand people, they're
      a million people, and there are some potential disadvantages with that.
      On the other hand, they understand that the quality of what
      <span class="docEmphasis">we</span> do can affect <span class="docEmphasis">their</span> life:
      in a literal life-and-death sense, not just in a sense of whether their
      milk is fresh or stale, or whether their newspapers arrive on time;
      their very lives can depend on the quality of our work. So, they're very
      motivated to make sure that they convey information to us as effectively
      as possible: what they do, how they do it, what they want to be able to
      do. It provides great clarity. So, we love for our people to get deeply
      immersed in our customers' problem. We call that "<a name="idx-CHP-13-0352"></a>acquiring domain knowledge."</p>
<p class="docText">We like our people, especially our more senior technical people,
      to become real experts in one of our customers' specific problem
      domains. When they acquire that expertise, we now have the engineering
      knowledge, the technology knowledge, and the domain knowledge all
      resident in one brain &#8230; and in my experience, that's when the magic
      happens. Then we can create these great ideas that in turn get the
      customers very excited that we can really do something that will improve
      things for them.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: "Where the magic happens"&mdash;can we delve into that
      a little bit?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: I have an opinion that,
      in the typical business&mdash;and I've done some commercial IT and other
      things in my career&mdash;they all kind of look the same. There are people who
      work for our customers who are designated to talk to the contractors, to
      describe what they need and how they work. Sometimes customers are their
      own worst enemies. They probably understand quite well what they do
      today, but sometimes their vision of tomorrow is three seconds from now,
      not three years. They can have a very narrow view of what they
      need.</p>
<p class="docText">So, we do things like sending our senior employees to spend a year
      with the National Security Agency or the National Reconnaissance Office,
      or we bring Army officers to live in our facilities for a year, or we
      send engineers out to observe maneuvers at the National Training Center,
      or even send engineers to Iraq and Afghanistan to ride along with units
      on patrol. Because typically the customers'
      designated experts, who may <a name="idx-CHP-13-0353"></a>understand their current practices, and may or may not
      have a sufficiently long-sighted vision of the future, probably don't
      have a grasp of the technology &#8230; and therefore don't understand the art
      of the possible. On the other hand, the private industry people have
      technical experts who understand a lot about technology, but if they
      don't understand the problem domain, you need an interpreter in the
      middle: "He said this, but what he really means is this," and so forth.
      We used to really concentrate on developing these
      interpreter&ndash;translators. But we realized it takes a long time to turn
      domain experts into engineers or scientists; we hire a modest number of
      retired military people because they can come in and tell us about how
      the organization works. But at the same time, what I've found is that
      what works better is to immerse our engineers into a customer's problem
      domain to acquire domain knowledge. Then I don't need a translator;
      there's no barrier between domain knowledge and technical skills. One
      person can merge both, develop new ideas, and help visualize the
      future.</p>
<p class="docText">So, that's what we aspire to: getting our technical staff to
      acquire a pretty good level of domain knowledge about a customer. Now
      there's no filter or barrier between the domain knowledge and technical
      knowledge, and that's where the "1 + 1 = 3" ideas for seeing what the
      future could be occur. That's how you get out of the "future is three
      minutes from now" bottleneck&mdash;you start thinking about how you can use
      technology to create revolutionary improvements in this mission. That's
      how we work with customers.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Are there any specific practices or tools that
      come to mind that help you deal with this?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: We have lots of specific
      mechanisms. For example, we have something called "user juries" where we
      take ideas out, and walk actual military users through how a system
      would work: a day in your life after we built this new system. Then, we
      discuss whether that will help them, and how we would measure such
      improvement; we try to measure projects not in terms of technical
      improvement, but in terms of operational utility. There are lots of
      other mechanisms; it's all about trying to eliminate or minimize the
      effects of the barrier between domain knowledge and science and
      engineering.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I would love to hear a story from an actual
      project where you could tell us a little bit about what you were
      building, and how you actually applied these
      mechanisms</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: Sure. I'll give you an
      example. On one of these military <a name="idx-CHP-13-0354"></a>command-and-control systems we were building, we had an
      interesting conceptual breakthrough.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I'm not familiar with military systems&mdash;what's a
      command-and-control system?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: An information system for
      military commanders. It allows them to communicate with each other, and
      allows them to maintain situational awareness: where everybody is, what
      their status is. It's how a commander can understand what's going on.
      Battlefields used to be small areas&mdash;a commander could stand on a hill
      with a pair of binoculars and could see what was going on. But by about
      1900, the battlefield started getting so big that you
      couldn't <a name="idx-CHP-13-0355"></a>stand on the hill like Napoleon did. You had to start
      using technology to "see" the entire battlefield. And the systems that
      do that are called "command-and-control systems."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">A soldier in the field using a command-and-control
      system built by Neil's team.</span></p>
<p class="docText">So, we were building a system like that. And we had in our head a
      model that was kind of like email: I've got a piece of information and
      want to send it to somebody, so I get the information into the system,
      and then I tell the computer the name of the person to whom I want to
      send it. One of the big "aha!" realizations we had is that that was
      actually a very low-value way to build one of these military information
      systems; the users eventually realized that actually they don't want to
      have to know whom (by name) is the right person to receive a piece of
      information: they wanted the system to figure out from the intrinsic
      nature of the information who are the people who would be interested in
      receiving that information, and then to send it to them automatically.
      If you're on the battlefield and you see something, and determine it's a
      potential target&mdash;for example, the Army and the Marines use a process
      called "call for fire," saying, "I want to tell somebody to shoot that
      tank for me"&mdash;maybe I'm just an observer and don't have a weapon or don't
      have the right kind of weapon or I need to stay concealed, so I can't
      shoot it, but I want to tell somebody to do so. But I don't know who
      that should be. So, let the computer figure that out, and automatically
      get the information to the right person.</p>
<p class="docText">So, we finally realized that they want to address a call for fire
      to the <span class="docEmphasis">system</span> (and <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> to a
      specific named person), and have the system figure out who they should
      ask to shoot it. Because there are a lot of different options: you could
      have the Air Force drop a bomb from an airplane, or you could have
      a helicopter fire a little missile, or you could
      have another tank shoot it, or you could have artillery stand 10 miles
      away and shoot shells at it. And you don't want this person on the
      battlefield to have to decide which mechanism to use. He might not make
      the right decision: he doesn't know who's in the area, who's ready to
      shoot, which kind of ammunition to use. His job is to recognize that
      there's a bad guy out there, and that we should shoot him. It's somebody
      else's job to decide what kind of ammunition to shoot, and what kind of
      delivery mechanism to use.</p>
<p class="docText">It took an amazingly long time for us to communicate with each
      other, and to realize that the "right" approach was for the system to
      figure out who would be interested, rather than having the originator of
      the information have to address the information to specific people by
      name. That's an example of the tension and the suboptimization that can
      happen when the user is speaking in one language and the scientists and
      engineers are speaking in another, and how the processes of getting
      engineers to become domain experts and having user juries and so forth
      can get you to have the "aha!" moment of "Oh! This is how I can do what
      you really need!" The users hadn't thought about it that clearly,
      either, and so we were all struggling with this useless idea of how to
      build the system.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I love that story. One thing that's interesting
      to me is that a lot of people think of military contracting and
      associate it with bureaucracy and paperwork, but the way you describe it
      makes it sound really tough but really interesting</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Neil</span>: I wouldn't trade my job
      for any other job on the planet. I'm the chief engineer of a
      35,000-person organization that does really important and really
      interesting things. This is a wonderful business for an engineer or a
      software person. Yes, there's a bit of bureaucracy inside the company
      because we're 100,000 people, but on the other hand, you can have 99,999
      really smart colleagues. If you can harness that size to your advantage,
      it can be great.</p>
<p class="docText">I've worked in small companies. It's a lot of fun, and it's really
      easy&mdash;there's 20 of you. But if you needed an expert in some other field,
      chances are there isn't one. Here, there's an expert in almost any field
      that's relevant to what we do. Since I'm the chief technology officer
      for a big chunk of the company, either I know who these people are, or I
      know who to call among my counterparts in the other portion of the
      company to find them. There are thousands of world-class experts inside
      this company and, if we can get organized, that size works to our
      advantage. So, when we are at our best, this is a very exciting and
      wonderful business. It has its bad days, like all businesses, but this
      is a great and exciting business for software people. And we have a
      completely insatiable demand for software people and system engineers,
      with the one caveat that they almost always have to be U.S.
      citizens.</p>
