<p class="docText">It seems like everyone we know wants to work at <a name="idx-CHP-20-0623"></a>Google. We hear about all sorts of great perks&mdash;from
        developers being able to spend some of their time working on their own
        projects, to massage therapists on staff to make sure everyone's nice
        and limber. But Google takes its software development very seriously,
        and Alex Martelli, originally hired by Google as an "&uuml;ber tech lead,"
        has been working on the serious side of software development there. We
        wanted to hear what he had to say about building teams at
        Google.</p>
</td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: How did you come to know
      what you know about how software works</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: I started out as an
      electrical engineer designing computer chips for Texas Instruments and
      then IBM Research. I found myself drifting from doing the hardware, the
      chips, to doing the system, to doing the microprogramming, because the
      research operation was just building a few prototypes at a time&mdash;to get
      the chance for the prototypes to actually be used by our target audience
      of scientists and such, we basically had to make it easy for them to get
      to there <a name="idx-CHP-20-0624"></a>with, say, FORTRAN or APL. They definitely weren't going
      to be happy doing microcode. So eventually, after a few years of
      drifting, I had to realize I wasn't designing hardware anymore. I lost
      track of exactly what was happening in hardware design and for chips and
      technologies, and resigned myself to being a software person
      instead.</p>
<p class="docText">Shortly after that, I joined a start-up where everybody basically
      had to do everything. Given that I was probably the most experienced
      developer in the group, I was by default tagged as a managerial type who
      was supposed to organize the team and make it work. It didn't really
      work that well the first time. Fortunately, I did manage to avoid
      killing the company and actually found somebody who had a little bit
      more of a clue about management, and I went back to doing mostly
      software development. Then, learning from what I'd done wrong the first
      time, I tried my hand at management again, and gradually got more
      comfortable and more skillful at balancing the purely technical
      contribution with organization and management and leadership
      points.</p>
<p class="docText">In 2004, I went to <a name="idx-CHP-20-0625"></a>Google and interviewed for them and just at the end of the
      year they sent me an offer to join them with a job description too cool
      to refuse: "&Uuml;ber Tech Lead." It basically means what I'd been doing for
      the last few years in my career, with a lot of technical aspects and a
      lot of management and leadership points as well. The "&Uuml;ber" part has to
      do with the fact that I've never been responsible for a single software
      development team at Google, but rather each team has its own tech lead.
      But I was responsible to oversee and integrate many teams in a certain
      area of the business.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Let's talk a little bit about that first attempt
      at management you were just talking about. What
      happened</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: I think the main thing
      that interfered with my performance at the time was very related to a
      deeply seated trait of my character, which is an abiding faith in human
      nature. I use the word <span class="docEmphasis">faith</span> advisedly because it's
      something you just have to believe. From observing the world, you cannot
      really come to the conclusion that human beings are fundamentally
      good&mdash;experimental evidence doesn't appear to support that very well. I
      guess I just have it in me.</p>
<p class="docText">So, for example, we had this guy who had been brought on board
      because he worked with another of the founders on a previous venture.
      But the other founder wasn't actually a software developer, so they
      didn't realize that he was bringing in somebody who really wasn't up to
      the extreme pressure that you experience in a start-up. He probably did
      well in a large company, where he could take limited responsibilities
      and execute them decently without making waves. But to make a start-up
      survive, you just need a completely different level of intensity,
      of involvement, and skill. One thing he definitely had learned from his
      previous stints at large companies was to make very credible
      excuses.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That's hilarious, but surely a bit of an
      exaggeration</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: I don't remember him ever
      coming forward <a name="idx-CHP-20-0626"></a>with "The cat ate my software," but we kept falling for
      it. So eventually, I was facing the near&mdash;not rebellion exactly, but the
      rest of the team were not stupid. I wasn't stupid, either, just too
      optimistic and too trusting. And they were realizing that this guy was
      basically dragging them all down. His productivity was negative. He was
      actually able to work intensely. He wasn't a shirker, but he'd work
      intensely for three days and make seven days of work for somebody else
      who had to fix all the bugs he had introduced. I kept giving him a
      second chance, third chance, fourth chance. And in that, in retrospect,
      I make myself sound silly. I assure you that with the amount of things
      to be done all the time in that kind of setting, it's only in retrospect
      that I recognize the patterns.</p>
<p class="docText">Eventually, I had to face the guy and do what is really the
      hardest thing to do for a manager&mdash;and one of the most crucial things to
      make a team work well. I had to say, "Even though you have been with us
      from day one, it just isn't working." That was the very first time in my
      life I had to terminate somebody, or heartily invite him to look for
      other opportunities, and I didn't expect how heart-rending it would be.
      But in the end that was absolutely indispensable to let the team
      survive. It's like one bad apple in a bushel can spoil everything. If
      management is too kind-hearted and, particularly, if the way the team is
      formed is based on those acquaintances and friendships, it's even harder
      to say these very unkind, but true and necessary words to somebody you
      count as a personal friend.</p>
<p class="docText">The fact that he just can't hack software well enough doesn't mean
      he's a bad person. And I'm sure part of why his excuses were so credible
      to me, beyond my incredible optimism, was that he probably deluded
      himself that they were the real reason he wasn't delivering. In the end,
      having to communicate that message worked. I'm sure people who are
      particularly skilled can do it without even breaking the friendship, but
      unfortunately, I'm not as good at that. It's like terminating a personal
      relationship that isn't working, but you've given it chances and chances
      and chances. It's heartbreaking, because when the relationship has
      become a part of yourself, you don't want to hurt this person. But it
      just isn't working, so what are you going to do? So, that was probably
      the harshest lesson I ever had to learn.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Do you feel like before you did that, there were
      problems in team dynamics because of this one particular person and his
      excuses</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: Yes, exactly. Everybody
      was very much invested in the success of the whole enterprise because
      it's a start-up. You're getting pocket-money-level salaries, and your
      big payday is supposed to be when the firm triumphs and takes the market
      by storm. So, you don't have just a professional involvement in the
      firm's overall success, your whole life has been poured into that. So,
      keeping somebody in your team who is actually doing damage to your
      chance of success is really pointless. And it's difficult to communicate
      because, hey, isn't that the manager's job to
      realize that? And the answer is yes. I was not doing my job&mdash;not all of
      my job. I had more work to do, between managing and technical
      contributions, than I could deal <a name="idx-CHP-20-0627"></a>with, but this part I obviously didn't do well and it was
      a very important one.</p>
<p class="docText">The rest of the team was fine among themselves. When I stepped
      back to individual contributor and found another pretty good guy to hand
      the management reins to, things really soared. First, because I was now
      able to use 100% of my time and energy to actually develop software, and
      second because this guy was obviously a better, more experienced manager
      than I was at the time.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What would you tell someone on a software team
      who sees that his manager is having that particular problem? Is there
      something that one of your team members could have told you to help you
      realize how bad the situation was getting, so you would deal with it
      sooner</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: There are many
      possibilities, and believe me, I've done a lot of introspection about
      it. I'm pretty sure I wasn't deliberately deceiving myself. There is a
      strong human temptation to just make believe it's not happening, and
      maybe it will solve itself on its own. It's just like someone who
      doesn't want to go to the dentist because he strongly suspects that he
      has something wrong with his teeth, but he's really afraid of how
      painful it will be to fix, so he keeps not going. It's wrong, but it's
      very human. We don't really like to face harsh realities that may
      require painful action and consequences.</p>
<p class="docText">So, take the guy you mentioned hypothetically&mdash;the one who
      recognizes, "OK, we've got this six-person team that would be absolutely
      great if it was five people because that person is just doing damage
      instead of giving positive contributions and the manager is totally,
      totally blind to that." It's particularly important if it's a small firm
      or start-up so that the success of the whole team is paramount to
      everybody. And that includes the manager.</p>
<p class="docText">How does he tell the manager? It's going to be almost as hard as
      it is for the manager to tell the underperforming person, particularly
      if it's not a one-on-one thing. If he's realized that there's this one
      person who just isn't pulling their weight, probably some other teammate
      is just as aware of that. If it's two or three people going to the
      manager and basically showing their bad perception here, it's going to
      be more effective. The manager obviously needs to be hit with a
      two-by-four, and if you can get two or three teammates together to
      supply the bad news, do so.</p>
<p class="docText">Incidentally, this is something where you really want to be face
      to face. I just can't imagine myself doing it in email or on the phone
      or instant messaging, because when you give bad news, you want to leave
      open the communication channel for emotions that body language and
      face-to-face communication provide. At the same time, it's absolutely
      crucial that you will be able to offer emotional reassurance. "You're
      doing a bad job doesn't mean you're a bad person. It means you've gone
      awry, and should do something different." That is something that is
      really much better communicated face to face, like most bad news.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So how much do you think the
      success or failure of that team relied on your role as a manager, and
      how much of that do you think came from the team dynamic
      itself</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-20-0628"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: Well, it relied on the
      success of the team's manager because, basically, that's the same thing
      as success of the team. But it didn't have to be me. Indeed, I stepped
      back to be a senior individual contributor and somebody else took the
      management reins, and things went much better. That was about 20 years
      ago, but I don't think human nature has changed very much. Technology,
      incredibly. Human nature, not so much.</p>
<p class="docText">There are technological and methodological aspects that would have
      made things much clearer&mdash;like, for example, if 20 years ago we'd had a
      properly structured agile team organization <a name="idx-CHP-20-0629"></a>with daily standup meetings. One thing about agile, which
      is a very big plus for actually working, but a potentially big risk and
      why so many people are afraid of adopting it, is that it makes truth
      emerge much sooner than the traditional channels of
      communication.</p>
<p class="docText">If everybody is standing around for five minutes in the morning
      and basically telling each other what have I accomplished yesterday,
      what I'll accomplish today, what stands in my way that maybe somebody
      could help with, you can't keep hiding bad performance day after day
      after day for very long. It becomes pretty evident. That is just one
      example of how agile structured methods provide so much better
      communication, and therefore, for better or for worse, make it extremely
      difficult to hide things from yourself or anybody else. The classic
      example is how agile estimating&mdash;burn-down charts and so on&mdash;gives a very
      clear picture of progress. It makes it painfully obvious to everybody:
      "Hey folks, this is our velocity. This is the amount of work we're
      actually able to get done. If we insist on having all the features that
      we originally accepted, this thing is going to be two months late." That
      happens to a lot of software projects, and is normally the kind of thing
      that people don't want to admit to themselves. They may start doing
      overtime and then maybe even burn themselves out, but in the end they
      just delay the inevitable. And if it appears far too late to do anything
      about it, it can be a disaster.</p>
<p class="docText">With the high visibility of agile methods, the painful reality
      will have to be faced much sooner. The earlier you face the reality, the
      less painful&mdash;although still painful&mdash;it is to fix it. You might have to
      drop some features and slide a couple weeks on the delivery time if you
      realize things early enough. But if you realize them way past deadline,
      then it's too late to do anything as relatively painless as that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think there's a shortcoming to the agile
      approach</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: The shortcoming is that
      you can't hide, and that is very scary for many developers and managers.
      Eventually the project will probably be a disaster, but in most
      particularly big corporate situations it may be that two weeks before
      you are scheduled to deliver and will not make it, there is a big reorg
      and the project disappears, and you don't get a bad mark on your record.
      That's like winning the lottery in a sense, but people keep hoping for
      that to avoid damage to their careers. I don't really think it's a minus
      from the point of view of the team or of the corporation or whoever
      wants the software delivered and wants to use it, but it's definitely
      scary for the manager and for the developers on the team
      because there's nowhere they can hide. It makes things so clear, so
      obvious to everybody involved.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-20-0630"></a>Another thing, which I already mentioned about giving bad
      news, is that in my modest experience I don't know how to make agile
      work in a <a name="idx-CHP-20-0631"></a>distributed team. I know people who claim otherwise and I
      really admire them, but in my experience, if the team is not collocated,
      all the extra amounts of communications going on are just missing. Not
      that I have any better solution&mdash;if you have to work with a totally
      dispersed team, I don't have any magic bullets to make that work. But I
      suspect that the usual Scrum experience just doesn't stretch that well
      to it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I think it's interesting that you brought up two
      really important sorts of things that go on in a team: transparency, or
      not being able to hide, and being able to have that constant flow of
      communication</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: I think pretty much all development
      methodologies, agile or otherwise, focus on transparency, on trying to
      make sure that people understand who is accountable for what and how
      they progress on that. You're saying that things like burn-down rates
      and projects will actually make that information much clearer for other
      people. I'd like for you to drill down into that a little bit more and
      tell me why you think those specific practices might make it clearer
      than, say, I don't know, earned value management, or other tools that
      have been used in all sorts of projects&mdash;software and otherwise&mdash;for
      decades</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: You know, you're right. I never thought of it
      that way, but burn-down&mdash;a staple of agile projects&mdash;isn't really all that
      different from earned value. Is it all that much more effective than
      stodgy 50-year-old project management stuff that they used to build,
      say, a nuclear reactor or the space shuttle</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: So, the reason I think
      <a name="idx-CHP-20-0632"></a>burn-down charts work particularly well is that they form
      an easily understood, shared language among any member of the project.
      And let's never forget the external stakeholders, the people who are
      rooting for the right software to be delivered on time and on budget.
      They may be internal customers if you are doing internal enterprise
      development, or they may be product managers, or marketing people if
      it's supposed to be sold in the marketplace; whoever plays the role of
      the customer for the specification discovery process.</p>
<p class="docText">There's the problem of quantifying exactly what it is that we need
      to do and what would just be nice, what we don't have to do, and how
      much will it cost to actually get those tasks done and deliverable to
      the user; all of these issues are absolutely crucial to the team. (I'm
      including the customer in the team, as is the best agile tradition.) And
      these issues are very effectively communicated by the burn-down charts.
      You don't call something "finished except it still needs QA." If it
      still needs QA, or anything else, then it is not finished. Finished
      means finished. Finished means something you can ship tomorrow.</p>
<p class="docText">Any code that has been checked into the trunk, approved, accepted,
      whatever your detailed procedure for calling a feature finished, should
      be ready to ship today. That's crucial. So the
      meaning of the word <span class="docEmphasis">finished</span> doesn't stretch in
      agile as much as it does in other methodologies. And the costs that come
      with estimating and planning "what do we do first, and what do we do
      next" are just as transparent. There is no magic wand that tells you
      those things for free. There isn't in any software development project.
      It's always a substantial part of the project's workload to determine
      exactly what is being done, and to change it in mid-flight and keep
      responding to the exact needs of the customer or of the
      stakeholder.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: A lot of what you're saying would probably come
      as a big surprise to someone who thinks that "agile" is synonymous with
      "we don't plan our projects."</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: With <a name="idx-CHP-20-0633"></a>agile development and burn-down charts, all of those
      factors that could otherwise end up stretching the projected delivery
      dates well beyond what the more rigid, more traditional methodology
      shows are fully accounted for as part of the software development
      process&mdash;which is exactly how they should be, because really, they are at
      the beginning or at a crucial cyclical time in the process of developing
      software. This doesn't really have all that much to do with the team
      aspect, but it has a lot to do with the development that the team is
      supposed to be doing. So, I guess these are basically two faces of the
      same coin.</p>
<p class="docText">If you count the stakeholders or product managers or customers as
      part of the team, then I guess you can say it has to be the team, but I
      haven't seen that done except in <a name="idx-CHP-20-0634"></a>agile development shops.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I find it very interesting that you drew a
      straight line from burn-down charts to talking with the customer.
      Burn-down charts are all about answering questions about the effort
      we've put in and the work we've done. I like that you used the phrase
      "right software," and talked about figuring out how you know when the
      project is finished, if there's still work to be done, specifically
      calling QA and testing in particular as something that people keep doing
      after they consider the project "done." I like that a lot, because if
      you crack open any traditional quality textbook&mdash;and I'm not even talking
      about software quality, I'm just talking about engineering quality in
      general, going back 50 years, going back to Deming and Juran&mdash;you'll see
      those are practically the textbook definitions of quality. Yet you
      brought them up in the context of agile
      development</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-20-0635"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Building the right software, conforming to
      requirements, fitness to use&mdash;we might not use those traditional quality
      terms today in an agile shop, but I think it's really interesting that
      they're still behind the ideas you've been talking about. It's almost
      drawing a straight connection to the team adopting this practice, having
      this meeting every day where they look at these charts, having a task
      board up there, where you actually see traditional quality practices
      showing through. I think a lot of software people wouldn't make that
      connection</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And it all has a big impact on the team&mdash;how they
      work together, their morale. There are other traditional quality ideas
      that are clearly part of agile, too, right? Embracing change is an
      important part of an agile process. But responding to changes, and
      making sure your stakeholders have a channel for making changes, that's
      also an</span> <span class="docEmphasis">important part of
      traditional project management. And doesn't that have an impact on the
      team's morale</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-20-0636"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: I believe that in this
      particular case, the periodic enrichment nature of most agile processes
      actually helps. If you do, say, a monthly iteration for some very large
      project, or bi-weekly for something possibly smaller and moving faster,
      you do fully expect things to change at the end of the iteration,
      because you devote some time at the end of the iteration to do a
      retrospective: "OK, what did we do in this last iteration? What went
      wrong? What went right? Is there some new thing we learned that we
      should apply in the future either to avoid mistakes or to take advantage
      of the best practice?" That means that change is systematically going to
      happen, not at random and unpredictable times, but on a schedule. There
      is a huge advantage in being time-driven. By time-driven I mean meeting
      every Thursday or Wednesday or something like that, as opposed to, "OK,
      whenever we're done, we're done."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Does that help you keep your project's schedule
      under control</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: It helps you pull into a
      stride, a rhythm, where you know that this is the deadline and
      everything that is not tested, committed, accepted by the deadline is
      not in this iteration. Even if a work is still in flight, you know that
      nevertheless, this is when you do retrospective introspection. Why did
      we end up with three tasks in flight where we've already done a lot of
      work on them and we have nothing to show for that? Well, they were
      harder than we expected, maybe, or my darn computer kept breaking down.
      So, there are solutions that are completely different. One is to redo
      the estimate of the remaining tasks: maybe through much more layering
      we'll have many more, smaller tasks, and so we are not going to be
      blindsided by one of them proving to be much bigger than we had
      originally thought.</p>
<p class="docText">So then at the beginning of the next iteration, it is absolutely
      crucial that upper managers or other stakeholders are there, because
      this is their occasion to change things. This is when they get the
      priorities right for this iteration, which may require dropping or
      postponing some features and tasks, moving others ahead, injecting
      completely new ones, saying that something that sounded like a great
      idea at the time is unfortunately not going to help, so it shouldn't be
      part of the shipment&mdash;and so on, and so forth.</p>
<p class="docText">Again, this is not random change that happens out of the blue, and
      strikes you as a team member by surprise. It's planned. It's forecast.
      You don't know exactly what will change, but you do know that something
      will change more likely than not, because the underlying business
      reality has changed.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds to me just from what you're saying
      that a big part of making sure that your team actually is successful and
      builds good software is not just setting the expectations of, say, the
      managers and the customers, but actually managing the expectations of
      the team themselves</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-20-0637"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: That's a very good
      observation. It's a two-way street. The engineers and developers in
      general and the team leader must be talking regularly to the people who
      are hopefully burningly expecting the software to be delivered.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: A couple of things kind of
      ran through my mind when you were talking about expectations, and
      meeting the expectations of the customer. I've worked personally on a
      few agile projects that have gone kind of crazily awry because of just
      those two factors. I've had customers before who, while they were
      involved in the entire process as agile dictates, decided to change
      their mind drastically during various iterations&mdash;to the point where we
      had to rewrite the entire premise of the thing that we were doing, to
      the extent that maybe we shouldn't have built the software in the first
      place until they had worked some of those out</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-20-0638"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">That's one thing that I would bring up. Another thing
      that's happened to me working in an agile environment is I've had
      developers who kind of refused to rein in their creativity, and have
      felt the need to add a lot of gold plating, features that the
      stakeholder never asked for and didn't need, but which the programmers
      thought were a great idea. Sometimes that resulted in better software,
      so people didn't say anything negative about it, but it almost always
      led to serious quality problems</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: Yes. Engineers,
      particularly those who are young and brilliant but with not yet enough
      scars on their back to have fought many battles, do tend to
      overengineer. I totally agree with that. So, what I've found works well
      for that is a practice that I already found well established at
      <a name="idx-CHP-20-0639"></a>Google when I got in, and I absolutely love. I tried to
      make it happen in the past, but it's so hard to actually make happen in
      the real world unless it's already in the culture: <a name="idx-CHP-20-0640"></a>mandatory code reviews. I would give credit for this to
      employee number one, Craig Silverstein. No piece of software gets into
      the code base unless it's been examined and approved by somebody else on
      the team. That's not the kind of structured code review that people had
      in mind in the '70s, with hours and hours of preparation and projection
      and a whiteboard, that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="docText">It's really a lightweight process, and it's perfectly suitable to
      happen in email or with lightweight web-based tools. The point is that
      if you can keep an eye on all the change sets and all the code reviews
      firing back and forth, whether you're directly involved or not, you'll
      never get blindsided by some change when it hits the code base. Now, I'm
      talking about changes done internally by the team itself&mdash;such as the
      <a name="idx-CHP-20-0641"></a>gold-plating aspects that you were mentioning&mdash;as opposed
      to changes requested by the customers, which is a very different kind of
      issue.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I could definitely see how that sort of code
      review could help the second problem Jenny talked about, the
      engineering, gold-plating problem. What about the first thing she
      mentioned, which I've definitely seen, too. I definitely remember what
      she was talking about, when her team just got destroyed by people on the
      business side who were asking for things they never should have been
      asking for in the first place. Jenny's team faced a terrible problem on
      that project. The customer completely and unexpectedly changed
      direction, and they really did have to practically rebuild the entire
      code base from scratch. I'm sure that she's not the only person who has
      run into that problem. Is there a good agile approach to that particular
      problem</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: It boils down to going to
      the two big objectives of a development team, which are do the right
      software and do the software right. Much of what we've been talking
      about is do the <a name="idx-CHP-20-0642"></a>software right. Given that the software has to do this and
      that, make it happen. Nice, solid, well-performing, bug-free, and so
      on.</p>
<p class="docText">But maybe even more important is to do the right software: the
      software that has the feature set that will really make the company
      succeed. I realize that if you have never been on the business side of
      things, it may seem that those changes, those totally absurdly drastic
      changes you're being asked for, are capricious and arbitrary. But they
      do make sense, unless you're working for a seriously dysfunctional
      company&mdash;in which case I would suggest printing your resume on the good
      laser printer.</p>
<p class="docText">If it's not a dysfunctional company, put yourself in the business
      guy's shoes. The world is changing under them, and it's all they can do
      to stay afloat.</p>
<p class="docText">There is one aspect in most schools of agile programming, that I
      don't entirely subscribe to: that generalities are shunned. Some
      <a name="idx-CHP-20-0643"></a>generality costs you, but some generality is actually a
      savings of time. So making&mdash;though it may be a silly example&mdash;a routine
      that computes the remainder of a division by three, a very specific
      task, is probably going to be more costly than doing a routine that
      computes a remainder by anything and passing it three as an
      argument.</p>
<p class="docText">So, if you have a good nose, a designer's nose and, to a lesser
      extent, an implementer's nose, for where generality comes free or even
      makes your work cheaper, then you as part of embracing change and being
      prepared for change build classes and modules and packages and routines
      to be configurable for situations that are a little bit
      different.</p>
<p class="docText">The point is that if the total amount of your work is more than
      starting from scratch, then this is a sad reality that just has to be
      faced. If there is reusable code in there, then it can actually be worth
      reusing. If the business-side people are being totally arbitrary and
      capricious and wasting the firm's money and your time and their own time
      and so on, then it's laser printer time. But more likely than not, they
      are doing the best they can in an extremely challenging, difficult, and
      changing world.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: All this discussion about agile reminds me of
      something that happened a few years ago. Jenny and I were brought in to
      do a talk at a prominent company about improving software development.
      At the end of the talk, we got into a discussion with the audience about
      agile development, which I think it was a little bit newer at the time.
      Then a developer stands up. He clearly had been there for a while. He
      was a big guy with a big, gray beard&mdash;he really looked like a very
      stereotypical developer&mdash;and other people in the room clearly deferred to
      him. So he gets up and&#8230;Jenny, do you remember exactly what he
      said</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: He said, "Agile means that you don't write
      anything down, you just start coding immediately."</span><a name="idx-CHP-20-0644"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: Right; I have a pretty
      famous colleague who would basically be applauding this guy's theories.
      He's a pretty well-known blogger, Steve Yegge. He works over in the
      Seattle area. Let's just say that we have our own dissents on the
      technical plane.</p>
<p class="docText">Search for him and "agile" in the
      blogosphere, and you'll find a million posts of his essentially
      condemning the whole idea, and explaining how the only right way to do
      software is basically what that developer was advocating. Just start
      hacking, and things will start to happen on their own. Don't just accept
      my summary of his theories; go read his own posts. They are well written
      indeed! And to be perfectly honest, to play devil's advocate, there are
      examples in which this has worked. My favorite one is&mdash;do you know the
      software company called <a name="idx-CHP-20-0645"></a>Autodesk?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Sure</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: Have you ever wondered,
      what does their business have to do with desks?</p>
<p class="docText">So, the story is they wanted to do an office automation
      application. Before Microsoft Office or other integrated suites, they
      wanted to do the automatic desk. And a couple people, very senior
      engineers in the start-up who actually didn't really like the idea very
      much, on their own spare time hacked on a computer-aided design
      application instead.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And they built AutoCAD just like
      that</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: Yes. They thought it
      would be more fun than doing invoice filing and all that stuff that the
      businesspeople said there were huge markets for. So the "AutoDesk"
      application never actually happened, but AutoCAD took the world by
      storm. The company didn't change their name, but despite their name,
      Autodesk, they are still flourishing in the computer-aided design
      business after 20 years or more. There's a great book, by the way, by
      one of the founders, explaining all these things and the history of
      Autodesk. So, that would be the counterexample, where the guys on the
      team actually doing things on the proper channels were, as it turned out
      in the end, not really producing anything marketable for the company.
      And the rebels, who basically were off on a ledge doing something
      completely different and "wasting" company resources to make something
      happen that has nothing to do with the company's business model&#8230;actually
      saved the company and made it a huge success.</p>
<p class="docText">But that's basically a story of people winning $137 million with a
      lottery ticket. It happens, but I wouldn't bank on it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Is that different from a classic skunkworks
      project</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-20-0646"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: In my mind, a skunkworks
      project is something that upper management is actually supporting. The
      team is hidden from the rest of the company, particularly middle
      management. Middle management's main role at a large company is to stop
      any change from ever happening (or at least it seems that way if you
      ever work with them). Good engineers in the trenches and, funny enough,
      some of the top management, may actually have vision, and so they may
      make something happen by hiding in a corner. This project, as far as I
      can understand from the history that Autodesk has published, was
      actually the group of engineers deciding entirely on their own.</p>
<p class="docText">Another example would be Microsoft Internet
      Explorer 1, the first edition. Some engineers had this idea that this
      new Internet thing was all the rage, and that Microsoft should have a
      browser&#8230;and the long chain of middle management totally killed that
      stupid idea. Nobody will ever make a penny with browsers. So the guys
      hid in a corner and starting writing a browser anyway. Then suddenly the
      CEO at the time, Bill Gates, issued a memo explaining that the Internet
      was everything, including the company's future, and that everything must
      change on a dime. And those guys had more or less working software ready
      the next day.</p>
<p class="docText">Again, that may be something you'd call a skunkworks project, but
      again, it's not something I would bank on. If you are working in a
      company that is dysfunctional, then maybe that's the only way to
      survive. But you know that there are other companies. If everybody in
      the company is pulling in the same direction, and we're all interested
      in getting the customers good software and making money that way, there
      should be no need to hide and go do your own thing instead of pulling
      the cart together with everybody else.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: In an environment like that, do you think that a
      more structured, more traditional agile approach would work a lot
      better</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Alex</span>: I think it probably
      would, because the idea of change is baked in, in a way it isn't in
      otherwise good processes&mdash;like the Rational Unified Process, for example.
      The continual iterations and the concept of timing them, fixing dates,
      and so on, are optional in RUP&mdash;it's something you can do, but it's not
      the core of the process. The core of the process is drawing a huge stack
      of diagrams that are illegible to anybody outside of the "priesthood" of
      your experts. I think that many teams love to produce very tall stacks
      of paper, because they basically can use them as walls to hide
      themselves from the rest of the organization, which might otherwise
      demand accountability and transparency. OK, I'm being a bit snide here,
      but you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="docText">The idea of building an enormous amount of specification before
      you start coding&mdash;eek! That is the kind of dysfunctional behavior to
      which the programmer you were quoting was basically overreacting in the
      other way. "Everybody is doing far too much rigid specs, so let's not do
      any at all." Well, there's a feasible middle way, you know?</p>
