<p class="docText">We had a wonderful boss, very friendly and open-minded&mdash;after
        all, he took the challenge to manage this "revolutionary" project.
        However, he had been in the company for more than
        20 years and was very accustomed to the culture. We, the young, set
        out to change his habits. He was enthusiastic about most of the
        proposed tools to automate the life-cycle process, but we noticed that
        he never used email (none of the managers did at that time). So, one
        of us played a trick on him; she scheduled a meeting with him and,
        upon arriving in his office, she promptly said she was going to teach
        him how to use email. You should have seen his face; the look of
        astonishment. He was used to telling his staff what to do, not the
        other way around. To make the story short, he could not refuse, and
        after learning, he really became a part of the team by participating
        in the online discussions and conversations, understanding the issues,
        and sharing the news. By avoiding the change, he was missing on much
        of the project chemistry. Sometime later he confessed that he
        "couldn't type" and therefore was embarrassed of showing his
        shortcoming. But this staff member and her boss became very good
        coworkers and friends, as the project progressed due to his openness
        to change. Those were key ingredients toward the success of the
        project.<a name="idx-CHP-17-0501"></a></p>
