<p class="docText">It's hard to describe the attitude at <a name="idx-CHP-7-0178"></a>MP3.com after the release of My.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0179"></a>MP3.com as anything other than post-coital. The staff
        was in a daze&mdash;a good one, mind you&mdash;waiting to see what would happen
        next. We watched the news sites and waited for something,
        <span class="docEmphasis">anything</span>, to happen. We knew it couldn't be too
        long before the RIAA or one of the majors did
        <span class="docEmphasis">something</span>, but beyond some initial and relatively
        minor posturing, everything seemed fairly quiet; almost too quiet. And
        so things started to get back to "normal," or at least to
        "non-emergency" mode. It's not that there was a lack of work to do:
        quite the opposite. Things were still humming: My.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0180"></a>MP3.com was undergoing a full redesign, we were
        upgrading the rest of our music-serving infrastructure to utilize some
        of the functionality we had designed for Da Bomb, and generally we
        continued with the day-to-day tasks that had fallen by the wayside
        during development of Da Bomb.</p>
<p class="docText">It was a bit weird, actually, because all of the anticipation,
        all of the buildup and energy that had gone into releasing My.MP3.com,
        just sort of dissipated. There was no project that everyone was
        clamoring to work on, no "this thing that is going on is something
        bigger than me, something bigger than the tasks I work on daily"
        feeling which inspired people to work what amounted to a second job
        just so that they could be a part of it. This doesn't mean that people
        weren't working 60- or 70-hour weeks, but perhaps just that we weren't
        working that many hours <span class="docEmphasis">together</span> as a greater
        organism, instead having gone back to our individual projects and
        small groups.</p>
<p class="docText">But with things returning to normal, some of the management
        "jockeying for position" which had lain (somewhat) dormant awoke from
        its slumber. More importantly, this was the first time it affected
        me.</p>
<p class="docText">The first thing to happen was that the meeting I had been trying
        to schedule with my manager for the past two months (and that he had
        repeatedly missed, which was somewhat understandable given the fact
        that he was managing the biggest project the company had ever
        undertaken) finally came about. We went into the little side office,
        and&#8230;</p>
<p class="docText">"Tom, I've got some good news for ya, buddy, you're <a name="idx-CHP-7-0181"></a>getting a raise!"</p>
<p class="docText">(Conversation continues, discussing the amount and how this is
        going to work, with me patiently waiting to see what comes
        next.)</p>
<p class="docText">"David, I'm really happy to be getting a raise, but honestly,
        that's not at the level I expected given what you had told me when I
        was hired on. You had specifically said that I could
        expect to be making between <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> <a name="idx-CHP-7-0182"></a>and <span class="docEmphasis">Y</span> within three to five months:
        it's now been six months and this raise doesn't even bring me up to
        the minimum amount."</p>
<p class="docText">"I'm sorry to hear that you're disappointed. Did you get that in
        writing when we hired you?"</p>
<p class="docText">(Mentally slaps forehead.)</p>
<p class="docText">"No. No, I didn't."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, I'm sorry, Tom. There's really nothing I can do about
        that then &#8230;."</p>
<p class="docText">I was annoyed: I felt like I had taken a salary of less than I
        was worth with the understanding that this would be rectified within a
        relatively short period of time once I had shown I could perform. Was
        I not performing? Or was I just getting screwed because this is how
        <span class="docEmphasis">every</span> company works: they hire you for as low as
        they can get you, and then give you incremental raises, but rarely a
        "step" raise.</p>
<p class="docText">I found out the answer to whether I was performing a couple of
        weeks later when I got word that I was being shifted from David's
        group to work for Janet Delfino in the infrastructure group. While
        this made sense based on the projects I was currently working on, it
        felt like a demotion. I had been traded for one or two programmers in
        Janet's department, and in looking at the guys that David ended up
        with, I felt like I was getting shoved off to the minors. I was
        crushed and felt fairly worthless&mdash;or more specifically, like I was no
        longer one of the Blessed who got to work on the cool projects.
