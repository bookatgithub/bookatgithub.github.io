<p class="docText">Developing a large tool set like HADS can be an expensive
        proposition. In addition to acquiring rights to the frontend compiler
        technology, external consultants and Honeywell engineers were used on
        the project. While this was not a large number of people, it still had
        a cost. Some of the managers on the project seemed to resent the
        expenditures. At one point in the project, an Ada compiler for the AMD
        29050 from an external source became available. Since there was not
        much of a potential market for a compiler for this target, it is
        likely that the target customer for this compiler was the 777 project.
        It may be that some at Honeywell were encouraging the compiler vendor
        to develop the tool set to replace HADS or as a fallback position if
        the <a name="idx-CHP-23-0758"></a>HADS team should fail. One day in a hallway, Bruce, one
        of the managers, came up to me and said, "Since there is an
        off-the-shelf compiler available, they are going to kill the HADS
        project." Naturally this was concerning, not for the sake of my job,
        as there was plenty of work to be done, but because we took pride in
        the quality of what we had done and didn't want to see it go to waste.
        But Bruce was known as a guy who liked to spread a lot of rumors and
        who liked to make others uncomfortable, so we didn't do anything
        special. We just continued on with our plans. By the time the other
        compiler came out, the HADS team had demonstrated numerous successes.
        Some evaluation of the other compiler was done, but the HADS
        compilation system was clearly superior.</p>
<p class="docText">The small HADS team was very successful, producing a large,
        quality system without missing any of its deadlines. Of course, we had
        some advantages that the 777 team did not have. For example, there is
        a standard for what it means to be an Ada compiler, meaning that the
        basic requirements for the product were known from day one of the
        project. Another big advantage we had was that we did not need to
        produce the volumes of customer documentation that the 777 project's
        waterfall life cycle required. Except for documenting those parts of
        the runtime that required DO-178B certification, we produced only the
        internal documentation it deemed necessary for reference and only
        external user documentation. This made things quite a bit easier for
        the HADS team than for the 777 team.</p>
<p class="docText">But there were also some things about the team that led to its
        success. What were the things that turned an initially ugly team into
        a beautiful, successful team?</p>
<p class="docText">The most obvious change was that a number of people who were
        merely going through the motions were replaced. The result was a
        smaller but much more dependable group. Having people that you can't
        depend on is not good. With a larger team, someone who is not "pulling
        his weight" can be overlooked for quite a while. With a small team, it
        is obvious what each person is doing. We found it much better to have
        a small group of dependable people. The small group that did the
        majority of the work was also highly competent. Many of us had not
        worked on compilers and related tools, but we all had worked on
        difficult projects and had developed a great deal of competence in
        programming in general. Experience in developing compilers did not
        seem to be highly important, but experience that involved proper use
        of software engineering principles did seem to be important.</p>
<p class="docText">It was much more than dependability and
        competence. A collegial attitude also developed. We all shared several
        characteristics that led to success. Most importantly, we all knew we
        were good. Because we knew we were good, we didn't worry about taking
        credit or getting blame for individual accomplishments. Because we
        knew we were good, we would ask others for help when faced with a
        particularly nasty problem. Because we knew we were good, we did not
        take offense if someone else offered a possibly better solution to a
        problem. Because we knew we were good, we were willing to take time to
        help out others. Because we knew we were good, we recognized the
        competence of our colleagues. Because we knew we were good, we didn't
        feel that it was necessary to get our own way, but could be insistent
        when it was important. Some have said that <a name="idx-CHP-23-0759"></a>HADS was a very egoless team, but I think that the team
        members all had pretty big egos; however, the big egos did not need to
        be fed. We all had a confidence in our abilities and the abilities of
        our colleagues.</p>
<p class="docText">We all worked very hard, and each of us worked to the maximum of
        his or her abilities. We worked very little overtime, but each of us
        came in on time and put in a hard, full day every day. Because we
        would ask others for help when we had problems, and because we could
        see our colleagues working hard each day, we always had confidence
        that the work was progressing.</p>
<p class="docText">During most of the development, each developer had the primary
        responsibility for developing a particular area. Some example areas
        were the storage manager, the exception manager, providing the linking
        capability to the AIMS requirements for separation of applications,
        register assignment, and optimizations. Since we knew the person
        primarily responsible for an area, it was easy to talk with the right
        person about an issue.</p>
<p class="docText">In addition to the competence and personalities of the team
        members, there were several practices that the team used that led to
        success.</p>
<p class="docText">Since the HADS project was being developed in-house, and the
        engineers on the 777 project got to know the HADS developers well, it
        was easy for the project engineers to approach one of us about a
        particular feature or optimization that he desired. This could have
        led to a lot of "feature creep" or conflicting requirements. We
        avoided this problem by insisting that all requests go through Tom,
        the team leader. He decided what requests should be worked on, as well
        as the priority of these requests. He did a good job of shielding the
        rest of the team from a lot of outside pressures. I'm sure that it was
        a difficult balancing act to protect the team and also be responsive
        to the 777 project.</p>
<p class="docText">A really helpful practice we used was to have a short
        (half-hour) meeting at the end of the day on Fridays. In this meeting,
        we assessed the progress of the past week and set the general
        priorities for the next week. This was pretty much a democratic
        process, though Tom, as team lead, had the final say. Very little
        general problem solving was done in these meetings, but we were
        allowed to give opinions about things to look into as a possible
        solution to a problem. Many agile teams currently use a similar
        concept, though they have shorter, daily meetings.</p>
<p class="docText">We had deadlines that were rigid on data
        and fairly rigid on content. The weekly meetings determined the
        primary focus for the next week. The "top 10" list allowed us to
        continually readjust focus onto the short-term problems that must be
        solved in order to achieve the long-term goal. The combination of
        longer-term deadlines, goals for the next week, and the ability to
        change daily through the "top 10" list provided for an agile
        development environment.</p>
<p class="docText">The development of a regression test suite, based on issues
        found either internally by the team or by users, provided continual
        feedback on the quality of the product. It also made it easy to find
        regressions introduced during development. When a regression was
        found, its seriousness could be evaluated to determine its priority
        and when (and where) it should be added to someone's "top 10"
        list.</p>
<p class="docText">The HADS project was quite enjoyable to work on. Much of this
        had to do with the beauty of the team and the success of the project.
        It is difficult to know whether the success&mdash;and the practices that led
        to success&mdash;caused the team to be beautiful, or whether the beauty of
        the team led to the successes. I suspect that they grew
        together.</p>
<p class="docText">Any project winds down as it either fails or produces what is
        needed. For the HADS team, the wind-down was gradual. Several members
        of the team were moved to areas of production for the 777 project
        where their expertise in Ada and their intimate knowledge of the tool
        set were beneficial. Gradually, the consultants were removed until the
        team was down to two people. In a final round of layoffs, I was laid
        off and transferred to the Honeywell Technology Center. After a few
        months, the one remaining team member grew tired of working by himself
        and he left Honeywell. Maintenance of the project was taken over by a
        completely different set of engineers. An irony of the project is that
        after all of the primary HADS developers had left the team, the HADS
        project was given Honeywell's Highest Technical Award.</p>
<p class="docText">The perspectives given in this narrative are my own. Others on
        the team may perceive things quite differently. Perhaps, though I
        doubt it, some of the primary developers would not feel that the team
        was beautiful. But for me, my experiences on the HADS team were one of
        the highlights of my career as a software engineer.</p>
