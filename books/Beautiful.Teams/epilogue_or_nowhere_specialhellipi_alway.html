        There"</h3>
<p class="docText">Honestly, the end had come a few months earlier at a fateful
        lunch at Fat Head's. The team had already suffered a few high-profile
        losses by this point. Someone had the bright idea that we should all
        get together for lunch.</p>
<p class="docText">It was just like old times, like back at the SDC. The
        conversation was fast and furious. The witty comebacks, put-downs, and
        general filth still had the same crisp timing and delivery. Our lunch
        hour stretched into two because no one wanted to leave. But soon the
        table was cleaned, and the last drinks were emptied, and we
        reluctantly headed for the door. Outside the weather was perfect, the
        sun shining and the air crisp as we exchanged a few goodbyes. I
        stopped almost mid-stride on the way back to my car. It hit me, like I
        was shot&mdash;shot with a diamond bullet, a diamond bullet right through my
        forehead. "<span class="docEmphasis">My god, I'm going back to work</span>."
        BeatUntilCreamy, a friend I had only recently brought into the company
        in a desperate attempt to help us address process and quality issues,
        spotted the change the very moment it happened. It took the sharp
        contrast of the lunch and the prospect of another day at what was left
        of <a name="idx-CHP-28-0895"></a>Rock Ridge to drive it home. What was keeping us going
        was a memory. The office wasn't fun anymore, and it probably stopped
        being fun a few years earlier. We just didn't notice it. Once we got
        back, we lingered long enough to confirm we all had similar
        realizations. We took off early. The next few months we'd just be
        going through the motions.</p>
<p class="docText">Some of us still work for our big client&mdash;lodged deep inside
        their former tormentor, making sure the Candygram System continues to
        kick ass. A few of us have regrouped to work at a very differently run
        company (most importantly, a profitable one). And surprising to me, at
        least, some part of Rock Ridge soldiers on. I expect its pipeline is
        still packed. Hedley, however, was forced by financial circumstance to
        sell the company. He is reportedly doing well.</p>
<a name="andrew_stan_i_understand_that_you_left_r"></a><p><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Stan, I understand that you left Rock Ridge
          and stayed away from Candygram for a year and a half, but now you're
          back working with C$ for Succubus. Are you a glutton for punishment?
          Is it like an abusive relationship, where you know you should get
          out, but he just keeps sweet-talking you back? How did you end up
          back in the fourth ring of hell, so to speak? Start out by telling
          me about what you guys ended up with at the end of the
          project</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-28-0896"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: It's easiest if I
          start talking about where we are now. Believe it or not, while we
          are working at Succubus, C$ and I don't actually have anything to do
          with Candygram anymore.</p>
<p class="docText">At the end, <a name="idx-CHP-28-0897"></a>Rock Ridge's code ended up being sold to Succubus, and
          obviously they originally brought us in&mdash;me and C$&mdash;to be the
          caretakers of Candygram. I guess it was just the way we worked at
          Rock Ridge, but C$ and I didn't try to horde our knowledge of the
          system.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Even though that would obviously be a good
          way to ensure your own job security</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: Right. We tried to
          give people an opportunity to know what we knew. And it turned out
          that they had no idea how to develop software there at all. So we
          tried to institute better source control, better processes
          generally. We wanted to help them improve their careers by learning
          the stuff that we'd developed at Rock Ridge through trial and error
          over all of our projects.</p>
<p class="docText">Eventually, I think we were successful enough at that, that I
          left to join Mark at the company that he'd left Rock Ridge for. One
          other Rock Ridge person, Tubman, was there, too. I was there for a
          little bit over a year and a half.</p>
<p class="docText">C$ got moved out of the Candygram group. Since both of us had
          done a number of projects that were successful, they wanted to move
          C$, and then later, me, when they hired me back, into the central IT
          organization so that we could do projects for the rest of Succubus.
          And that's the position we're in now.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So you and C$ are basically taking some of
          the better practices you developed&mdash;mostly under fire, to cope with
          the insane obstacles you faced at Rock Ridge&mdash;and teaching them to
          the people at the same company that was the source of some of those
          very obstacles</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: Exactly. I mean, we
          still do occasional projects with the Candygram team. But Succubus
          has the least amount of IT resources and expertise in other areas
          that are at the core of their business. So that's where we are now.
          Now, ironically, now that we're not there at Candygram, they brought
          in a major outside consulting company for an engagement where
          they're evaluating all of the processes around Candygram: whether
          they're spending enough money on maintenance.</p>
<p class="docText">They're trying to cut costs, and the management was under the
          impression that Candygram was expensive. Well, it turns out that the
          consulting firm told them that they're actually spending less on the
          system than their competitors do on theirs. And there's other people
          that know it now.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds like Candygram has had a real
          impact on the way Succubus runs their business</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: Before, when they
          were on the mainframe system, they had no visibility into that part
          of the business. Now, with Candygram, they have a data warehouse,
          they have tons of reports and data extract, and they actually have a
          whole team of business analysts that can get the data they need
          about their operations to do something about it, which is something
          they didn't have before.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And that's all based on
          the stuff you guys developed over the few years at Rock
          Ridge?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: Yep.</p>
