<h3 id="title-IDA12KDG" class="docSection1Title">30.8. Final Notes</h3>
<p class="docText">Edom Engineering staff weren't the types to wait around and let
        algae gather on the pond. On the day of my email, they read and
        responded to it, but then plunged back into the depths of their
        work.</p>
<p class="docText">No manager called on me to justify or explain my email&mdash;they
        probably knew very well what was going on, whether or not George had
        been forthright with them&mdash;but the direction of the Longjump project
        did not change, either. Ultimately, with the new business model based
        on reselling a competitor's system, we met our stated goals and
        finished the project on time with a formal success status. The product
        fizzled in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="docText">As a matter of fact, <a name="idx-CHP-30-0930"></a>RISC chips in general never lived up to the hype.
        Conventional chip makers found ways to improve speed despite the
        supposedly crippling complexity of their designs, using such
        strategies as prefetching instructions, predictive scheduling, and
        multicores. Some of these strategies, such as breaking large
        instructions into smaller parts with a consistent structure, they
        borrowed from RISC design.</p>
<p class="docText">The conventional manufacturers kept costs low through economies
        of scale, and invested the profits they garnered through market
        dominance in high-priced, state-of-the-art facilities that could
        produce chips even more cheaply. RISC manufacturers never caught up.
        So, although RISC companies remain in the field, RISC as a new
        computer market turned out to be a miscalculation by a large group of
        computer industry pundits and investors. Edom Engineering's last,
        great hope turned out to be just a footnote in that story.</p>
<p class="docText">I was never fired. I stayed at the company
        a few more months, until the remaining project of interest that I was
        documenting&mdash;the thread-safe Motif library&mdash;got canceled.</p>
<p class="docText">At that point, I went to my manager's manager, who headed a
        large engineering team and had an excellent rapport with me. I said to
        him, "My major project just got canceled, and I don't have enough
        work&mdash;what would you like me to do?"</p>
<p class="docText">This, of course, was a code phrase for: <span class="docEmphasis">I don't see
        any future for myself in this company, and I need your reassurance to
        stay</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">My manager's manager smiled in his perennially congenial way and
        answered, "Don't worry about it. Take some time to do some
        studying."</p>
<p class="docText">I took that as a code phrase for: <span class="docEmphasis">I have nothing to
        offer you. Go ahead and look for a new job</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">My departure was part of a general exodus during the company's
        subsequent and vertiginous decline. Since then, I have barely followed
        the sequence of acquisitions by other lackluster companies in the
        field. I feel now that it would have been better for everyone&mdash;the
        employees, the investors, and the customers&mdash;if the exodus had occurred
        before the Longjump project; it did no one a favor to push for the
        preservation of a dying business model.</p>
<p class="docText">But because we all chose (out of our affection for the products
        on which we had worked so hard during the years) to participate in
        this last gasp of a company we had built, we could at least benefit
        from the models we developed for behaving under extreme business
        conditions. I can't claim that my email blast was the proper way to
        channel the anger and fear that I was absorbing from those around me,
        but I aver that it was a psychological survival tactic that helped
        many of my colleagues. More interestingly, it was a somewhat distorted
        precursor of open communications on modern digital networks that
        underlie the more bottom-up, contributor-driven, democratic
        corporation being promoted by business experts today.</p>
