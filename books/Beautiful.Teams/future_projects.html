<p class="docText">After the success of our first project, Fred wanted to get a few
        more teams to go <span class="docEmphasis">extreme</span>. This turned out to be
        more difficult than expected. First of all, Fred wanted to run each of
        the other teams the same way as our original team. "This is the way we
        do pilot projects," Fred told me. Of course, BBS has a process for
        trying new things, and we could not break that mold!<a name="idx-CHP-15-0426"></a></p>
<p class="docText">I warned him not to force each team into the exact same
        practices. I did not think it would work. Each team is unique and each
        team member has unique skills. There will be differences, and they
        won't own the process the way we did.</p>
<p class="docText">Well, we tried it anyway. The projects were
        successful, delivering two <a name="idx-CHP-15-0427"></a>to three times more high-quality software per
        plug-replaceable-programmer days than the standard BBS development
        project. But as much as we tried, we could not get each team to follow
        the exact same practices. Of course, much of the core was the same,
        but there were many variations. Each team found its own way.</p>
<p class="docText">Some of the biggest obstacles I encountered were cultural. Their
        culture included pride in the processes they developed and followed.
        Those processes helped them do many great things. But they needed to
        get faster. Something had to change, but the culture resisted change.
        A year later, I spoke to a lead engineer in a nearby group and asked
        him whether his team was doing XP. He told me it was too much trouble.
        A team that wanted to go <a name="idx-CHP-15-0428"></a>Extreme, as Bud called it, had to put together a 30-page
        process justification approved by the process police. Not many project
        teams volunteered to be the next XP project.</p>
