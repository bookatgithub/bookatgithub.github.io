<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: We're interested in talking
      to you about your experience, and how you came to know about how teams
      work together</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: Right now I'm the
      practice leader for agile development for <a name="idx-CHP-26-0792"></a>IBM Software Group. For the most part, I help customers
      become more agile and more effective at what they're doing. I also work
      with IBM itself. A lot of that is helping people to work together more
      effectively, often in teams. I've written a few books, and done a lot of
      work in the agile community. I'm the guy behind Agile Modeling, the
      Agile Data Method, and the Enterprise Unified Process.</p>
<p class="docText">As far as my background in teaming, it's a lot of hard-earned
      experience, I guess. Software is developed in teams, for the most part.
      As a result, you either learn the easy or the hard way&mdash;and I guess for
      me it was the hard way&mdash;about how to work in teams.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Getting companies to adopt the kinds of practices
      and techniques you talk about means convincing a lot of people to change
      the way they do their jobs&mdash;and the way they think about those jobs. How
      do you go about making those kinds of large changes?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: I think a lot of it is
      just trying to get stuff done. Software's hard, software's complex, and
      you need to work with people. I think the first obstacle you have to
      overcome is yourself, in recognizing that you can't do it all. You're
      going to need help, and you're going to need to learn from
      others.</p>
<p class="docText">As far as <a name="idx-CHP-26-0793"></a>obstacles go, a big one is being able to observe
      <a name="idx-CHP-26-0794"></a>when the team is not working well, because it's not always
      obvious. If people are shouting at each other, then something bad
      <span class="docEmphasis">might</span> be happening. But I worked on one team where
      an observer from the outside, if they were to look at us, would think we
      were about to kill each other. But for whatever reason, the way we
      worked together best was to argue. We could argue something out, and
      we'd be shouting sometimes&mdash;you'd think we were about to kill each other.
      What was happening was that we were working together really effectively.
      Some of it was just because we'd grown to respect each other. And even
      though we'd never really talked about it, we knew that our process was
      to talk about it and argue things through. Invariably, nobody had it
      right going into the discussion, but through the argument we came to a
      much better conclusion to whatever we were working on.</p>
<p class="docText">My point is that you can't always tell when a team is
      dysfunctional. Because in that case, an outsider would have thought we
      were dysfunctional, but we were actually phenomenally effective. If
      there's negative shouting and screaming, that's a problem. But
      sometimes, you can be on a team where everyone's trying, but nobody's
      communicating, and nobody's reaching their goals. It might not be
      explicit, but there's a slippery slope that occurs where everybody can
      work really hard for a long time, but in total, you're not accomplishing
      much. The easy analogy is that during the day you've got people digging
      a hole, and at night other people are filling it up. Everybody's working
      really hard digging and filling holes, but in the end nothing of value
      is actually occurring.</p>
<p class="docText">That can happen on dysfunctional teams, and
      it's not always obvious that it's happening, particularly if the team is
      large and distributed. When you haven't bonded and you're not close,
      it's difficult <a name="idx-CHP-26-0795"></a>to observe that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, the way that the team communicates can be an
      obstacle, not just to getting the work done if the communication is
      problematic, but even to recognizing whether or not a team is effective.
      And it sounds like personality conflicts can be a real problem. If the
      team has the right stuff technically, but the people don't mesh for
      whatever reason, it can keep work from getting done. I'm guessing that
      someone who was very introverted and avoided conflicts whenever possible
      would have had trouble joining your team, right? Even if they were
      perfect, technically, to fill a slot that's open on your team, I have a
      feeling that they'd be lost. But sometimes, you end up in a situation
      where there's a personality mismatch. What would you do about
      it?</span><a name="idx-CHP-26-0796"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: So, say there was an
      introvert that ended up getting caught in the crossfire, or however you
      want to describe it. Someone would have to notice. The introvert would
      have to step up and say, "You know what? I really don't like this." But
      that would be really hard for them. So, say that's not happening. Then
      somebody else would have to notice, which is easier said than done. In
      that environment, our manager would have noticed.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think it's the manager's job to
      notice?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: I would hope so. A good
      manager or team lead should be responsible for <a name="idx-CHP-26-0797"></a>looking out for everybody on the team, which is easy to
      say but hard to do in some situations. Whoever's in the team lead role
      or the manager role should be looking out and asking themselves, "How is
      this person doing? How are they fitting in? How can I help them? What
      problems are they running into?"</p>
<p class="docText">And they need to have techniques to help them notice these things,
      and status reports might not do it. The introvert probably wouldn't
      write in a status report, "I hate working with these guys. I'm not
      getting things done, and I'm not fitting in." The team lead needs to
      observe that.</p>
<p class="docText">Say that someone observes that this person is running into trouble
      and not fitting in well. I would hope that person would bring it up
      amongst the team, or point it out to the extroverts who are shouting at
      each other: "Hey, this is working for you, but Sally over here is really
      having a rough go of it. Can you try to bring her into the conversation,
      and maybe calm things down and try to find ways to work with her?"
      Everyone else on the team would have to find different ways to work with
      Sally, and Sally would have to maybe step up a bit. We'd all have to
      take the opportunity to learn; which, to me, is the mark of a
      professional. You should always be trying to improve how you're doing
      and how you work. In particular, you've got to get good at
      collaboration, working together with others and working on a
      team.</p>
<p class="docText">For technical people, this can be a
      challenge. This industry rewards people for their technical skills, and
      many of us are really geared for being technical, but we often
      shortchange the softer "people skills," or whatever you want to call
      them. As a result, we don't focus on them as much. And those are
      important things, at least in software development. People are a primary
      factor of success on a software team. The way you act with each other
      matters a lot more than whatever cool new technology you're working with
      today. This is something we don't appreciate as much.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I think a lot of people would be a little bit
      surprised sometimes to hear that, since you've spent so much of your
      career talking about architecture, development, and practices:
      object-oriented development, UML and software modeling, agile
      development, planning, and process in general. But, when asked about the
      biggest problems that face teams, the ones you bring up are
      people-based, how people work together. Were you surprised to figure
      that out? Or is that something you knew from the
      beginning?</span><a name="idx-CHP-26-0798"></a><a name="idx-CHP-26-0799"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: Yes, I was surprised,
      but I figured that out fairly early, I guess through observation and
      experience. I figured out pretty early that there's more to it than just
      technology. I didn't actually fall into this people stuff right away. I
      guess my first step was to realize that we need to look past technology
      to process and practices. When I went back to school for my master's
      degree, I started focusing on <a name="idx-CHP-26-0800"></a>Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW), which is a
      fancy academic term for groupware. I guess that's what gave me an
      appreciation for software people issues, because that's what CSCW is all
      about. In this case, how do we use technology to get people to work
      together more effectively? That's how I became more aware of these
      software issues.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: You've also spent a lot of your career talking
      and writing about practices. Have you ever found that the practices
      themselves that people are using can help you get past those obstacles
      to team building that you were talking about? Or, on the flip side, can
      those practices themselves be an obstacle?</span><a name="idx-CHP-26-0801"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: In non-solo development,
      techniques like <a name="idx-CHP-26-0802"></a>pair programming&mdash;or from Agile Modeling, modeling with
      others&mdash;you can start to get that recognition that you have to work
      together on a regular basis. A lot of people in the agile community
      practice what they call "<a name="idx-CHP-26-0803"></a>promiscuous pairing," where not only do you work in pairs,
      you swap pairs on a regular basis. When you do that, not only does the
      quality of your work improve, you learn a lot from others from working
      with them. By swapping pairs on a regular basis, that really forces the
      issue, and the team has to learn these softer communication skills to
      survive in this environment.</p>
<p class="docText">But like you pointed out, that in and of itself can be a
      challenge, and not everybody can work this way. This is one of the
      challenges that the agile community faces. In a way, the software skills
      that we're talking about and trying to improve upon are a barrier to
      entry to some people. Some people really do just want to focus on the
      technology, and really do want to work by themselves. And that's OK.
      That, I think, is something that an organization or team needs to
      recognize: that not everybody's the same, and some people just don't
      want to work on teams. There are some jobs where it is solo work. I
      think that's an important observation.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Throughout doing the
      research for this book, we've talked to many people who have told us
      about agile practices and agile in general. And everyone seems to have a
      slightly different definition of what agile actually means. Can you tell
      us a little bit about how you got started with agile? What kind of
      project did it solve? And also, what kinds of problems did it cause?
      Because nothing's a silver bullet. We'd love to hear your thoughts on
      that, and on what agile really means to you</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-26-0804"></a><a name="idx-CHP-26-0805"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: Definitely. On the Agile
      Modeling site (<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/"></a>) I've
      got my definition. I've actually got it on the screen here&mdash;let me read
      it to you: "Disciplined agile software development is an iterative and
      incremental (evolutionary) approach to software development which is
      performed in a highly collaborative manner by <a name="idx-CHP-26-0806"></a>self-organizing teams within an effective <a name="idx-CHP-26-0807"></a>governance framework with 'just enough' ceremony that
      produces high-quality software in a cost-effective and timely manner
      which meets the changing needs of its stakeholders."</p>
<p class="docText">Now, there's some "motherhood and apple pie" stuff in there. But I
      think those are all important features, and a lot of it is
      teamwork-based. So, for example, all of the talk about working in a
      highly collaborative manner and on <a name="idx-CHP-26-0808"></a>self-organizing teams, that's more obvious from a team
      perspective. But one of the things that a lot of agilists don't talk
      about, which I think is unfortunate, is the governance framework aspect
      to it.</p>
<p class="docText">No team works in a vacuum. There's an overall organization and
      environment that the team is working in. And the work of that team needs
      to be governed, and governance in some ways can be a good thing.
      Unfortunately, it's not always done right, which is why some software
      professionals cringe when you use the term
      <span class="docEmphasis">governance</span>. But you do want to make it lean, and
      you do want to make it as effective as possible.</p>
<p class="docText">Working closely with your stakeholders is absolutely critical, and
      that's a teaming issue. In the agile world, we talk about the "whole
      team" concept. That may or may not be a practice, depending on your
      point of view. People should have enough skills on the team to get the
      job done, and you're going to work together to do whatever that job is.
      And that's a very good thing. But what's often missed is that someone
      needs to keep an eye on that whole team, and make sure that whole team
      is actually staying on course and whatever it is they're trying to
      achieve actually makes sense in the overall organization. That's
      something I think isn't discussed enough in the agile community.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Those two things&mdash;governance and self-organizing
      teams&mdash;sound like opposites to me</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-26-0809"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: They're really not.
      Everybody is governed, and this is something that often gets missed.
      "Self-organizing" doesn't mean that you're out of control and doing your
      own thing. It means that the team members themselves decide how to meet
      their goals. But the goals themselves, the resources they use, the time
      frame they have to do it, those are governed by the organization.
      Somebody's paying the bills. Just the financial issue alone is an issue,
      because if the organization doesn't like what your team is doing, they
      can pull the plug. Now, that's a harsh governance mechanism, but it's
      fairly realistic. How did the team start up? If it's a software
      development project, there must be some kind of goals you're trying to
      achieve. There <a name="idx-CHP-26-0810"></a>has <a name="idx-CHP-26-0811"></a>to be an initial vision. And setting that vision, the
      mission&mdash;that's a form of governance as well. The rights and
      responsibilities of the team, the reporting chain: that's governance.
      For example, the junior programmer might not have the same decision
      rights as the senior technical lead. That's a form of governance as
      well.</p>
<p class="docText">So, governance is given short shrift, I think, in many situations.
      It's always happening, but we don't recognize it. And it's a shame if we
      ignore it, because one of the things I see in the agile community is
      that we're so paranoid about bureaucracy and wasted time that things
      like governance will instantly be beaten up. "We don't need any
      governance; it's a waste of time!" Well, no. Bad governance can be an
      obstacle to leadership. Let's try to be effective at governance, because
      the value of governance is to help us make good decisions and go in the
      right direction. Let's keep the baby and throw out the bathwater.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, a team can be governed by the vision, by the
      goal of the project, as well as by the expertise and limitations of the
      team and the company. Now, I've personally seen plenty of software
      projects go off the rails because the project governed the vision, and
      not the other way around. I guess that's one way you can describe scope
      creep</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-26-0812"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: Yes. The vision should
      evolve over time&mdash;and rightly so, because the situation evolves, too. But
      what happens, for whatever reason, is that long before the project
      actually starts, somebody has this idea that you need to do X and
      achieve whatever goals, for whatever business reason. There's always
      this long list of opportunities that an organization has. But there's
      only so much funding, so they have to choose what they want to do, and
      hopefully do it effectively. The reason for that project really does
      direct the effort, because you really want to make sure that you're
      achieving those goals. And if the goals are changing, you want to make
      sure they're changing the right way, and you want to manage that
      evolution. You should be doing a reality check every so often, which
      doesn't happen as often as it should.</p>
<p class="docText">I ran a survey through Dr. Dobb's a year or two ago about how
      people define success, because we don't have many numbers on this. It's
      my philosophy that if <a name="idx-CHP-26-0813"></a>a project is in trouble, someone should actually say,
      "Hey, this project is in trouble!" Somebody has to make a decision about
      how to get this team out of trouble. If nobody knows how to get the team
      out of trouble, we need to cut bait now, and stop throwing good money
      after bad. Now, that's my philosophy, but I didn't know how many other
      people thought this way. So we asked. And what we found was that
      something like only 41% or 42% of respondents said that in their
      organization, if a project is in trouble, it's considered a success to
      cancel that project&mdash;which is a real shame, because if I recognize a
      project is in trouble, I want to get it out of trouble as soon as I
      possibly can. I would consider <a name="idx-CHP-26-0814"></a>stopping a project as early as possible. That's obviously
      not a good idea, but I'd rather waste half a million dollars and learn
      the hard way than waste three or four million dollars and learn the hard
      way.</p>
<p class="docText">The only way that you can actually make that work is to monitor
      what's going on, and ask these sorts of questions. Is this team still
      succeeding? Does this project still make sense? Because teams can become
      blind to that. A team can be phenomenally successful in whatever
      the scope <a name="idx-CHP-26-0815"></a>of the project is. But the environment could have changed,
      and they may not have recognized that. Whatever reasons there were
      <a name="idx-CHP-26-0816"></a>to start that project may have changed, and we need to
      stop it.</p>
<p class="docText">So, for example, in the fall of 2008, we had the financial crash.
      For a lot of financial institutions, their business environment changed
      dramatically from September to October. I'm sure that some of them put
      some projects on the shelf, because the business environment changed so
      radically that some projects no longer made sense. It's no fault of the
      development team at all. Still, why throw good money after bad?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: The idea of aligning the project to the company,
      of having somebody looking out to make sure the project we're building
      is the right project to build, reminds me of a problem that I suspect a
      lot of agile teams face. But I've never heard anyone talk about it, and
      maybe you can help shed some light on it. One of the bread-and-butter
      practices that a lot of agile teams follow&mdash;and, I think, a good one!&mdash;is
      to bring a business representative into the team. Sometimes this is
      part-time, sometimes it's even full-time. I can see that embedding a
      stakeholder or business person in the team itself can do really good
      things for communication and information sharing, and for making sure
      the scope doesn't creep in the wrong direction. Now, to be honest, I've
      never really seen this done all that well, because I've rarely come
      across stakeholders who feel that they have that kind of time, for
      better or worse</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-26-0817"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">But, for a team that does manage to embed a stakeholder
      into the team, I worry that they may run into a problem where they also
      start to be affected by that very same blindness that you just
      mentioned. If you bring the stakeholders from the business side into the
      team, and everybody suffers from the same blindness, then who's looking
      out for the project's goals to make sure they're still aligned with what
      the company needs?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: There are a couple of
      things there. Sometimes the outsiders go native. It doesn't matter who
      you're bringing into the team. If you work closely with an existing team
      enough, you'll start relating to that team, start relating a little bit
      less to where you came from, which in this case is the business side of
      things. And this can be a problem.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the risks of the "whole team" concept is <a name="idx-CHP-26-0818"></a>groupthink. The basic concept of groupthink is that if a
      group of people work together long enough&mdash;and this can be several
      months&mdash;they start to think the same way, and start to become blind to
      the same issues. Psychologists sometimes talk about this in relation to
      risky decision making. For example, you might not be willing to bet $100
      on a horse race. But if you're out with your friends, and one of them
      bets $100 on a horse, and then another bets $100 on a horse, then
      betting $100 starts to seem less risky to you. So, the entire group
      together would together make what they perceive as a very risky
      decision, but because you're in a group, suddenly that risk has gone
      down. And that sort of thing happens as well.</p>
<p class="docText">So, there are these interesting team dynamics that you have to
      watch out for. Nothing's perfect, right? And this is something that
      governance efforts have to watch out for. The challenge with
      governance&mdash;and this is the reason I think that people are bitter about
      IT governance&mdash;is that a lot of organizations facing a problem like this
      will go into "command and control" mode. The people doing governance
      will think that they're managing.</p>
<p class="docText">They'll try <a name="idx-CHP-26-0819"></a>to direct the project, and they'll get too actively
      involved, or they'll place too much of a burden on a team. They'll start
      asking the team to produce regular status reports or attend the monthly
      control board meeting, or they'll have these milestone meetings every
      couple of months to ask the team to justify what they're doing. That
      throws a lot of extra unnecessary burden on the team. Good governance
      should be about enablement and about motivation. It shouldn't be about
      command and control, and it shouldn't be a burden. Obviously, there will
      be a little overhead, but it shouldn't be too much. If it's too much,
      the governance effort becomes detrimental, and that's a very serious
      challenge.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, how do you approach that challenge? What's
      the first thing you do to make sure that you're not forcing a team to
      have to put up with detrimental governance?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: You want to automate as
      much as possible. Per Kroll and I wrote a white paper on this about a
      year and a half ago called "Lean Development Governance"; the
      philosophies there were to automate as much as possible, to make it as
      easy as possible to report accurate metrics, and for the person doing
      governance to understand that different teams are in different
      situations. The people doing governance need to be flexible, and
      understand that a team of 5 people will work differently from a team of
      50. A team building a data warehouse works differently from a team
      building a website. Your team building a website will work differently
      from my team building a website. We're different people, and we're
      different teams, even if we're building similar things with the same
      technology. And as a result, those teams need to be managed in different
      ways.</p>
<p class="docText">A very common mistake that governance people make is that they try
      to inflict the same process and the same governance structure on
      different teams, and it just doesn't work because different teams need
      to be governed in different ways. The goals might be the same, but the
      way that you reach those goals will be different. The way I like to say
      it is that you should be aiming for repeatable results, not repeatable
      processes. But that can be a challenge for the more rigid and
      bureaucratic among us.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: That's interesting to me, because when you talk
      about engineering a lot of automated solutions to deal with this stuff,
      that can actually get to be as heavyweight as writing a lot of
      documents. Creating a lot of test frameworks and putting automation
      scripts in place, and putting all the practices in place that you need
      to automate your quality activities upfront, and the engineering effort
      needed for that, seems like it can be very heavy</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-26-0820"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: That's a very good
      observation. If you're toolsmithing all of your own tools, it is quite
      heavy. This, I think, is another challenge to the agile community. Many
      agile teams rely on open source software, and for very good reason. But
      there are limits to that, and one of the limits is one of integration,
      and particularly one <a name="idx-CHP-26-0821"></a>of governance and accurate metrics reporting. You need to
      go beyond some of the agile rhetoric.</p>
<p class="docText">For example, there's an example called <a name="idx-CHP-26-0822"></a>Jazz, and if you go to <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://jazz.net"></a> you can download demo copies of it. But
      in Rational Team Concert, which sits on top of Jazz, we automate all of
      this. All of the stuff that agile teams are hand-jamming&mdash;their defect
      trend reports and their burn-down charts, whatever
      it is that they may or may not be reporting on&mdash;that they're either doing
      manually, all <a name="idx-CHP-26-0823"></a>of that gets generated automatically in real time. So,
      there's no real curtain there. But that's because it's already
      implemented.</p>
<p class="docText">If you had to implement it all yourself, it'd be a phenomenal
      amount of work. So, there's limits to some of the things we see the
      mainstream agile community doing right now. There are some challenges
      there.</p>
<p class="docText">No development team in a bank or an insurance company would think
      of developing their own compiler. That's something you buy or download
      free of charge. So, now you're starting to see better-integrated tools
      that are providing the information you need to govern effectively. But
      you definitely don't want to be hand-jamming all this and implementing
      it yourself, because that's a huge burden.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: We've been talking a lot about obstacles to
      building software, but we'd really love to end on an upbeat note. Can
      you tell us about a great team that you've worked
      on?</span><a name="idx-CHP-26-0824"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: One of the best teams I
      was ever on wasn't a software team. It was at my karate dojo. I trained
      in karate for about 10 years until an injury sidelined me, which is
      unfortunate, but that's the way it goes. There are some very interesting
      philosophies that a lot of teams can benefit from. One of the
      philosophies or rules in North American karate is the concept of belts:
      you go through a white belt, then a yellow belt, and so on, all the way
      up to black belt. And one of the rules was that somebody who's a lower
      belt, somebody who's not as experienced, can always go up to someone
      with a higher-ranking belt and ask them for help. That person is
      responsible for helping them to the best of their ability. Now, part of
      that help might be to say, "I don't know how to describe this to you,
      but this person over here can help us, so let's work on this and get
      better at it."</p>
<p class="docText">The willingness to ask for help is critical. But the willingness
      to give help is critical, too, and one of the principles of martial arts
      is that you learn more through helping and teaching than you do
      <a name="idx-CHP-26-0825"></a>by just trying to work things through by yourself. This is
      something that many people can relate to.</p>
<p class="docText">If it's just orange belts in the room at the time you can still
      work together on things, and help each other achieve what you need to
      achieve. That willingness to work with each other that I learned in
      karate, I try to apply on software teams. It's interesting to me that
      the agile community does coding katas and runs coding dojos. I think a
      fair number of people are bringing martial arts ideas into software
      development. The martial arts have been around for a long time, and
      they've figured out how to teach people. Because it's pretty much all
      voluntary: as an adult, you go to a martial arts class because you want
      to learn, or get more fit, whatever your goal is. But you're there
      because you want to get better.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It's really interesting to me that you say that.
      I've been studying another Japanese martial art, aikido, for about 10
      years. And one thing I really like about aikido training is that
      everybody always trains together. And teaching more junior people is
      considered an important part of your training, especially as you get
      more senior. One of the things that I've found over
      and over again&mdash;I didn't expect to find this, but I did&mdash;is that I
      actually learn more from teaching other people than I do from being
      taught by other people</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-26-0826"></a><a name="idx-CHP-26-0827"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">That's another thing that I think translates well to the
      programming and software world. For example, when Jenny and I wrote
      <span class="docEmphasis">Head First C#</span>, our book on teaching people to
      program, I learned a lot by figuring out how to explain some of the
      concepts to somebody new. I mean, I definitely understood, say, core
      principles of object-oriented development going into the project. But I
      really feel that figuring out how to explain to a new C# programmer why
      they care about encapsulation, or the difference between interfaces and
      abstract classes, in a way that they'll actually understand and connect
      with, brought me to a whole new level of
      understanding</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-26-0828"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">And I found that this all translates directly to my job.
      I found that as a manager, especially, when part of my job is to train
      people on my team and help them not just do their jobs but develop
      professionally, I'd learn from them, often unintentionally but sometimes
      intentionally. Sometimes someone who's only been programming for a few
      years has some really good ideas that I've never heard before. So, I
      definitely relate to what you're talking about</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: It's interesting,
      especially if you look at some of the <a name="idx-CHP-26-0829"></a>pair programming research into different combinations. If
      a novice pairs with an expert, for example, what they found is that both
      people benefit. Obviously, the novice will pick up a lot from working
      with the expert. But the expert learns from answering those questions.
      And the question might be something straightforward: "Why are you doing
      that?" Well, it's because&#8230;wait, why <span class="docEmphasis">am</span> I doing
      that? It forces you to think through some of your practices, which is an
      opportunity to improve. "This really doesn't make a lot of sense, and
      maybe I can do it better."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Wow. What you just said is almost exactly the
      same as something Jenny and I wrote about in our first book. Actually,
      I've got it right here&mdash;it's from the section that's about pair
      programming teams that have a junior member and a senior member: "Often,
      a junior team member will ask a seemingly 'na&iuml;ve' question about the
      code that turns out to identify a serious problem. This is especially
      common with problems that the senior member has been living with for so
      long that she no longer notices them. Sometimes the extent of a code
      problem only becomes clear when it is explained to somebody else." That
      sounds exactly like what you were just talking about</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">And that begs the question for me: why is it so damn
      hard to get programmers to do it? Of all the practices, agile or
      otherwise, that I've had my own teams work with and talked to other
      people about, pair programming is the one practice that I've had an
      almost impossible time getting teams to adopt. It's even harder to get
      them to do that than to start doing automated unit tests and test-driven
      development</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: I think there's sort of this intuitive notion
      that having two people on the same thing is just inherently wasteful,
      and people just don't want to do it</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: There's a lot of that.
      Also, people just aren't comfortable with it. There's something to be
      said for being at your desk by yourself, doing your own thing. It's
      interesting; pair programming's tiring. You do it
      for five or six hours, and you're exhausted, because you're actually
      working.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the things I do, and it's a bit harsh, is to really force
      the issue. My technique is that I'll bring the idea up with the team:
      here's what it's all about, here's how you do it. But it's hard. We'll
      talk it through, and talk about why it's hard. And what I'll get the
      team to agree to is to try it out for a month. We'll swap pairs on a
      regular basis&mdash;every day, you should work with someone new, not whoever
      you worked with yesterday. We're going to talk it out. We're not going
      to tolerate solo programming for that entire month. And at the end of
      the month, then we'll make the decision about whether or not we want to
      keep doing it. And what I've found is that by forcing the issue, and by
      really keeping people's noses to the grindstone, is that by the end of
      the month very few people want to go back to solo programming. But it
      takes a while. It's a "no pain, no gain" kind of deal&mdash;I'm sure there's
      other rhetoric, but sometimes you've just got to suck it up and do it.
      And pair programming is one of those things where you just have to force
      the issue for a while. Because it <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> uncomfortable
      at first. It feels strange, and for many people it's outside their
      comfort zone. So you've just got to do it. What I've found is that on
      the teams that choose to do it, very few&mdash;maybe 5%&mdash;of the people go back
      to solo programming. But it takes a month.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think that's because it's hard for
      someone to put himself in the mindset of someone who's actually doing it
      if he's never done it before?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: I think so. Pair
      programming is initially a hard thing, but there are a lot of benefits
      to it. There's an intrinsic benefit that's very hard to observe
      directly, and that's the problem. It's one of those things where it's
      easy to say, "Well, there are two people working at the same desk, so
      they're half as productive." So, it's easy to knock if you've never done
      it. But once you've experienced it, it's pretty good.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think that's something that might be a
      general rule for getting teams to accept changes? That once they've
      tried it, they won't want to go back, no matter how much whining there
      was at the beginning?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Scott</span>: The general conclusion
      I'd draw is that if there's something where there's so much discussion
      out there and so much evidence that it works, then it's worth trying.
      I'm not sure if you're at the point of your life where eating a lot of
      bran is a good thing&mdash;eventually, you'll get there, believe me! It's not
      something you want to do to begin with. But after a while, you think,
      "Eh, that's pretty good for me." So eventually, you'll need to just
      tough it out and do it.</p>
