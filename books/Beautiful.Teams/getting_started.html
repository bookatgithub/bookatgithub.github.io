<h3 id="title-IDAU3JVC" class="docSection1Title">15.2. Getting Started</h3>
<p class="docText">Early on, we had the option to grow the team, but we decided to
        wait a month until we had an iteration under our belt. This way, we
        started the learning process, building our experience. In an iteration
        or two, we could coach the new people with a lot less
        guesswork.<a name="idx-CHP-15-0402"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Johnny, now our <span class="docEmphasis">customer</span>, Alan, and I wrote
        all our <a name="idx-CHP-15-0403"></a>use cases on note cards. We wanted them to be easy to
        manipulate, just like Kent and Ron taught me at Immersion. At
        Immersion, I learned about <span class="docEmphasis">user stories</span>. To me,
        it seemed that a user story and the name of a use case were virtually
        equivalent. We considered changing our practice from use cases to user
        stories, but Johnny warned me, "If we decide to use user stories, we
        are going to have to write a justification to deviate from our
        standard process." Johnny also was concerned about the informality of
        user stories, and added, "Besides, I think that a user story is too
        light on detail. We would never get that approved."<a name="idx-CHP-15-0404"></a></p>
<p class="docText">We decided to continue using use cases; after all, it was an
        accepted BBS practice. We figured that we were going to push the
        envelope in many other areas, and uses cases seemed to be the right
        vehicle for us. We decided to pick our battles carefully and save our
        "get out of jail free" card for when we really needed it.</p>
<p class="docText">Just before we were to begin our first iteration, Johnny and I
        worked out the detailed steps for the core use cases. The core use
        cases had the highest value and the most architectural impact. We were
        ready to start iterating.</p>
<p class="docText">Looking into the future just a little: after the first
        iteration, we started considering the XP practice of automated
        <span class="docEmphasis">acceptance tests</span>. Like Kent and Ron suggested at
        Immersion, we built an application-specific testing language. We tried
        to make it readable and not too programmer-ish; the goal being that a
        domain expert could read and write the tests without being a
        programmer. After a few iterations, it became clear to us that the
        information in the use cases and the information in the acceptance
        tests was a form of duplication. Duplication is one of the wastes and
        liabilities that XP tries to prevent.<a name="idx-CHP-15-0405"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Eventually, I built a case for not detailing out the use cases
        at all. Instead, we would write the acceptance tests before the
        iteration, providing the details that were in the use cases.
        Acceptance tests would be an executable specification! And we would
        replace the use-case elaboration effort Johnny had to shoulder with
        writing acceptance tests.</p>
<p class="docText">As it turned out, this was too extreme for BBS. We kept doing
        both use cases and acceptance tests because that seemed easier than
        bucking the system yet another time. I guess that's what Jerry
        Weinberg would call becoming a pickle. Put cucumbers in with the
        pickles, and what happens? "Cucumbers get more
        pickled than brine gets cucumbered." [3] XP got a little pickled, as
        did I.</p>
<p class="docText">Let's get back to getting our first iteration started. After
        estimating a few stories, I mean use cases, Johnny chose the first
        iteration. The initial use cases described core functionality,
        functionality that encompassed the most common operations the system
        would be expected to do thousands, if not millions, of times per day.
        Alan and I got to work. Ellen, a part-timer on the team, joined in and
        worked with us from time to time. She was a senior engineer winding
        down from her last project. She was ready to go <a name="idx-CHP-15-0406"></a>Extreme with us. We agreed that all production code
        would be created using pair programming. It's good we had a third team
        member because with all the meetings that Alan got pulled into, it was
        good that I had Ellen to pair with when we could not keep Alan out of
        the meetings, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="docText">Our first iteration was a success. We delivered most of what we
        planned. Looking back, I see that this was quite an accomplishment. At
        Object Mentor, we came to know that first iteration as "<a name="idx-CHP-15-0407"></a>iteration zero." Not just because we computer geeks like
        to start counting from zero, but because so many first iterations
        accomplish <a name="idx-CHP-15-0408"></a>nothing. It was our first XP project. We did not know we
        were supposed to fail, so we delivered working core functionality
        instead.</p>
<p class="docText">This team did not fight each XP practice. As I later experienced
        as a coach, the teams desire to learn and try new things made the
        project a success. Sure, Ken Beck wrote the book, but it was our
        process.</p>
<p class="docText">We learned some of the ins and outs of test-first design and
        incremental development. Our manager, Fred, was thrilled with the
        output. "I used to get only a draft requirements spec after a month,
        but we've got working code!"</p>
<p class="docText">We had the base learning and initial code in place. It was time
        to ramp up the team.</p>
