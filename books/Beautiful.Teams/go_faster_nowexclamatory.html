<p class="docText">Nancy mentioned that the team was behind in our one-on-one. She
        said, "What are you going to do about it?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, they're behind by a week or two. What are you going to do
        to make up the time?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Nothing."</p>
<p class="docText">"What do you mean, nothing?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Nancy, the team is working as fast as they can. They are
        working only on this project. They are doing what they can. Some of
        them are working overtime already, which is not good because we still
        have six weeks left on this project."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, why don't you cut out the unit tests and reviews? That
        would free some time, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p class="docText">I was stunned. "Nancy, you are joking, right? Without the unit
        tests, we would have no testing at all. Without the unit tests, we
        have no way to know if what we're doing is good or not. You want to
        release this product in six weeks, right?"</p>
<p class="docText">Nancy nodded.</p>
<p class="docText">"Then let my team work the way they need to."</p>
<p class="docText">"But what about the code reviews? Maybe they can forget them.
        That might save some time."</p>
<p class="docText">"Nancy, it's been a long time since you
        wrote code, right?"</p>
<p class="docText">Nancy nodded.</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, it's harder now than it was for you. Did you ever write
        code that worked the first time?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Yeah, a couple of times."</p>
<p class="docText">"So, you wrote code that worked the first time, maybe five times
        in your 10 years as a developer? Were you dealing with pointers? I
        thought you were writing in assembler."</p>
<p class="docText">"Yes, it was assembler. The pointers were not like the pointers
        in C."</p>
<p class="docText">"So, why do you think that eliminating the code reviews is going
        to help us finish faster? That's just going to make it slower at the
        end, when we won't know what's wrong.</p>
<p class="docText">"Why are you asking me about this anyway? What's going on? Are
        you under pressure?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Yes. Big Cheese is telling me my job is on the line if we don't
        deliver in six weeks, not eight."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, doesn't he tell you that about every project?"</p>
<p class="docText">Nancy grinned, "Yes, he does."</p>
<p class="docText">"So, why are you believing him now?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I really want to make sure you are doing everything you
        can."</p>
<p class="docText">"Look, if Jack and Jill can stop their other project, and come
        back here and do system testing, this might <a name="idx-CHP-27-0861"></a>speed up the project. But the developers can't work any
        faster than they are.</p>
<p class="docText">"I'll tell you what. In our next team meeting, I'll ask the
        developers if they can think of something that will help them work
        faster. Whatever it is, I'll let you know, OK?"</p>
<p class="docText">"OK, but see if you can do something."</p>
