<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">LET'S SAY THAT YOU'VE
      GOT A JOB TO DO, AND YOU NEED SOFTWARE TO DO IT. AND LET'S SAY
      THAT</span> you've got two choices. The first is a brilliantly
      engineered piece of software. It never crashes, has a beautiful user
      interface, and has great technical support. It's fast, a pleasure to
      use, and inexpensive, and it runs on any operating system and
      practically any computer. But it doesn't do what you want. The second
      piece of software, on the other hand, is terrible. It's buggy, it
      crashes all the time, and it's slow. It runs only on an obscure
      operating system, and needs a very expensive and very fast machine if
      you want it to be at all usable. It's got a terrible user interface that
      makes even the simplest task a chore. But it does 20% of what you need.
      Which one do you choose?</p>
<p class="docText">Unfortunately for you, you'll end up with the poorly written piece
      of software, because it actually does something that you need it to do.
      And while this seems like a somewhat ridiculous scenario, it's actually
      not that far from the truth for a lot of us.</p>
<p class="docText">The worst possible mistakes in working with teams happen when your
      team's goals diverge. And, unfortunately, it's a lot more common than a
      lot of us realize. This shouldn't really be a huge surprise. Anyone
      who's cracked open a college textbook on software engineering has
      probably seen a chart that shows that it gets exponentially more
      expensive to fix a bug the longer it takes to realize that it's in the
      software. But most experienced programmers don't need a textbook to tell
      them this&mdash;they've almost certainly seen it firsthand.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the most common ways that software projects run into
      trouble is that people on the team are trying to solve the wrong
      problem. Over the years, we've talked to dozens and dozens of
      developers, testers, architects, project managers, and other software
      people who all universally recognize that gut-wrenching feeling that
      happens when you deliver what you think is the final product to the
      customer, only to have them say something like, "Well, that looks very
      nice, but isn't it also supposed to do &#8230; ?" We all know the feeling of
      our hearts sinking when we find out about that enormously important
      feature that nobody told us about. Is there any experienced programmer
      among us who hasn't had the thought, "I would have built it entirely
      differently if someone had told me two months ago that it was supposed
      to do <span class="docEmphasis">that</span>!"</p>
<p class="docText">If you've spent any time on an agile team, then you probably
      recognize the saying, "Embrace change." One reason that programmers on
      agile teams work well is that they keep revisiting those goals. They'll
      make sure those goals are out in front of everyone: the team will make
      sure the goals are up on a whiteboard, and they'll have meetings
      specifically to make sure they're on top of any changes. And they get
      the customers involved in the day-to-day project work, because that's
      the most effective way to make sure that everyone's aligned to the same
      goals.</p>
<p class="docText">But even though we know how much those changes can damage the
      project, it's far too easy for us, as developers, to dismiss the idea of
      setting goals at the beginning of the project. And it's even easier for
      our own customers, users, and stakeholders to send us down the wrong
      path before we even get a say in the matter.</p>
<p class="docText">Customers&mdash;the people who we're building the
      software for&mdash;are not very good at telling us what they need. They'll ask
      for solutions instead of telling you what their problems are. They'll
      ask for a smoother, faster, less smelly horse and buggy, when what they
      really want is a better vehicle that will get them from point A to point
      B. They don't know enough to ask for an automobile, and it's all too
      easy to go about building a better, more improved horse and buggy. A
      developer needs to know enough about the whole transportation problem to
      find a better solution.</p>
<p class="docText">On the other hand, we, as developers, have our own peculiar
      problems. It's very easy for us to <span class="docEmphasis">think</span> that we
      know exactly what software we're about to build. We habitually interrupt
      our customers halfway through their explanations and say, "OK, I
      understand what you want." Then, we go off into our cubicles and build
      the software that we think they need, only to find out that we
      completely misunderstood their problems. (We've done this ourselves on
      rare occasions, usually because we really wanted to work with a
      particularly cool new technology, and were basically looking for an
      excuse to play with it.)</p>
<p class="docText">So, understanding your project's goals is critically important,
      and the stories and interviews in this section show us exactly how this
      affects our teams. It doesn't matter how good the software is, or if
      it's the wrong software for the customer. One of the biggest challenges
      of working with a team is keeping everyone aligned to that goal so that
      they build the right software. And even the best teams can have
      conflicts around those goals, conflicts that can tear a team apart. But
      if you align people to those goals from the beginning, and keep everyone
      in the loop as they change&mdash;and they <span class="docEmphasis">always</span>
      change&mdash;the project is much more likely to be a success.</p>
