<h3 id="title-IDABLKVC" class="docSection1Title">27.1. How Did We Get Here?</h3>
<p class="docText">If we turn on the Way-Back machine to the beginning of the
        project, Big Cheese brought the project team together <a name="idx-CHP-27-0830"></a>and said, "I have great news. I sold a new version of
        ProcessControlApp. But it has to do these three things faster, and
        have these five new features. And, we need it in six months."</p>
<p class="docText">The project team of six developers got together and discussed
        the problem. They'd worked as a team for several years. The newest
        team member had 18 months of experience working on the product with
        the team, and the most senior developer had initiated the product four
        years before. They knew each other and how to work together.</p>
<p class="docText">ProcessControlApp had no GUI because it was integrated into a
        manufacturing line. All of the access into and out of the application
        was through the command line or through an API. ProcessControlApp did
        a visual inspection of the material on the line, made some decisions
        about the material, and commanded the line based on its decision. So,
        although there was no GUI, ProcessControlApp was a highly complex
        application, where performance (how fast could the software make the
        decision?), reliability (how much uptime did the software have?), and
        accuracy (how many false positives or negative decisions did the
        software make?) all counted.</p>
<p class="docText">For the previous two releases of ProcessControlApp, they'd all
        worked together, along with two testers and a writer. They knew how to
        work together as a team. They told the VP of software engineering they
        needed that same writer and two testers.</p>
<p class="docText">I was the SQA manager, so it was my job to assign testers to
        different projects. When I met with the engineering VP, Nancy, I
        explained I had no testers available. "But you have to give them two
        testers. They can't get the project done without them."</p>
<p class="docText">"I have no testers. Look, here's where everyone is allocated."
        We discussed the other projects and their relative priorities [1].
        Nancy agreed that I had no testers to provide. I asked about hiring
        more people, and Nancy told me I had no budget to hire more
        people.</p>
<p class="docText">I thought for a minute and suggested, "Hmm, I can't do the
        testing, and I can't give them testers. But here's what I can do for
        the team. I can be their project manager, help them see options, and
        remove obstacles so that they can get work done. Since this is a
        process control application with no GUI, this is possible. Difficult,
        but possible. Is that OK with you?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Talk to the team and see if it's OK with them."</p>
