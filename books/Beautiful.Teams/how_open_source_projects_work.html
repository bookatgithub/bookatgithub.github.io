<h3 id="title-IDAVUDSR" class="docSection1Title">21.1. How Open Source Projects Work</h3>
<p class="docText">If you've already taken part in an open source project, you can
        skip this section. If not, let me introduce the basics of how such
        projects work so that the tools discussed in this chapter will make
        sense.<a name="idx-CHP-21-0651"></a><a name="idx-CHP-21-0652"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Open source software</span><sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-21-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> is software released under a free copyright, allowing
        anyone to copy, modify, use, and redistribute the code (in either
        modified or unmodified form). Much of the software that runs the
        Internet and the World Wide Web is open source, and an increasing
        number of desktop applications are as well.<a name="idx-CHP-21-0653"></a></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-21-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> The older term <span class="docEmphasis">free software</span> is
            synonymous. There is not space here to explain why there are two
            terms for the same thing; see <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href=""></a>
            if you'd like to know more about this.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Open source programs are usually maintained by loosely organized
        coalitions of software developers. Some volunteer their time, others
        are paid by corporations in whose interests it is that the software be
        maintained. Because the participants are often spread across many time
        zones, and may never have met each other, the projects rely to an
        unusual degree on highly sophisticated <a name="idx-CHP-21-0654"></a>collaboration tools: bug trackers, email lists and
        archives, network-based chat rooms, version control repositories,
        wikis, and more. You don't have to be familiar with all these tools;
        I'll explain the ones that figure in the discussions that follow as
        they come up.</p>
<p class="docText">Each open source project must decide how to organize and govern
        itself. Usually this is resolved by informal means: projects tend to
        be started by a small group of people anyway (sometimes one person),
        and over time, as interested volunteers show up and get involved, the
        original core group realizes it would be to the project's advantage to
        invite some of those newcomers to become core maintainers, too.
        <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-21-FNOTE-2">[]</a></sup> But once a project has many contributors, it can be
        difficult to keep track of them all and to identify which ones to
        cultivate as potential core maintainers. The first tool we'll look at
        grew out of one project's need to solve this problem.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-21-FNOTE-2">[]</a></sup> You may be wondering what it means to have a "core group" of
            maintainers when open source means that anyone has the right to
            change the code. Doesn't that mean that anyyone who wants to be is
            a maintainer? Not quite. In open source, anyone is free to make a
            copy of the code and do what she wants with that copy. But when a
            group of people get together and agree to maintain one particular
            copy <span class="docEmphasis">collectively</span>, they obviously have
            control over who is and isn't in that group. Similarly, anyone who
            wants to translate the Bible is free to do so, since it's in the
            public domain, but no one can force one group of translators to
            work with another, and if two groups don't work together, the
            result will be two independent translations. In open source
            software, this situation is known as a <span class="docEmphasis">fork</span>,
            as in "fork in the road": two independent copies with increasingly
            diverging sets of modifications, growing increasingly apart over
            time. In practice, however, forks are rare: more often,
            programmers coalesce around one particular copy in order to pool
            their efforts.</p></blockquote>
