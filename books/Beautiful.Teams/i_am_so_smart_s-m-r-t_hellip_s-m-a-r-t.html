<h3 id="643999-954" class="docSection1Title">7.5. I Am So Smart: S-M-R-T &#8230; S-M-A-R-T</h3>
<p class="docText">By the time everyone returned from the Christmas break, the
        company was, as Robin used to say, "firing on all cylinders." Everyone
        was working crazy hours, especially our systems guys (who seemed to be
        building half a dozen new servers every day, never mind the normal
        tasks of installing new network appliances&mdash;the ones that didn't fall
        off the truck when being delivered, that is&mdash;and managing terabytes of
        storage) and our crack QA team, who were charged with testing each new
        piece as it was completed and came online. I was still fighting with
        both Perl extensions and Apache modules at this point, which were
        functional but still had some lingering bugs on the data reporting
        side. To me, it was an exercise in banging my head against a wall
        repeatedly: I just wanted it to be done. In all
        honesty, I was kind of jealous of Degenhardt, too: even though we had
        spec'd out the concurrency service together, he was the one who got to
        implement it. It was actually probably better that way: he did a
        killer job <a name="idx-CHP-7-0176"></a>and I had my hands full, but there was a little bit of
        longing as I struggled with Apache and Perl day after day.</p>
<p class="docText">We still touched base on it periodically, bouncing ideas off one
        another regarding how things should be implemented (or maybe it was
        just me asking him questions so that I could feel like I still knew
        what was going on!), and one of the cooler things he did&mdash;and this was
        typical BMD&mdash;was to use representative MP3 files for error conditions.
        As in, if you tripped the security sensor, you ended up being served
        an "error" MP3 in your playlist instead of the song you requested. Of
        course, they weren't just any MP3s; they were five-second clips of
        Homer Simpson! Case in point: if you were trying to play more than one
        song at once, the servers would ding you and serve up a recording of
        Homer saying: "I am so smart: S-M-R-T &#8230; S-M-A-R-T!" Brilliant!
        (Although that audio clip will forever be embedded in my brain as a
        result.)</p>
<p class="docText">The funniest part, however, was that when it came time to test
        the system, QA was beat up and tired enough that they just came to him
        and said, "We don't understand. The server keeps playing the same song
        over and over again, and it's just this guy speaking &#8230;."</p>
<p class="docText">D'oh!</p>
<p class="docText">Miscommunications aside, development was moving right along. Of
        course, there were minor blips, like the fact that we moved our
        servers to a <span class="docEmphasis">brand-spanking new</span> data center a
        week before the release, but this was all part of the excitement,
        right? Right &#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">Well, OK, there were still other minor difficulties. About a
        week before the scheduled January 11 release, Michael was given his
        first test drive of the system and he absolutely, positively lost his
        collective shit. "Who is responsible for this???" In a flash, the VP
        of engineering, the director of web design, and just about everyone
        involved in the decision-making process had been herded into Michael's
        office. You can guess what the problem was:
        <span class="docEmphasis">JavaScript</span>!!! This was the darker side of
        <a name="idx-CHP-7-0177"></a>MP3.com's "take initiative" mentality: it was all fine
        and good until you did something wrong or got on Michael's bad side.
        This was a shame, but it was the way it was: you went from working
        your ass off, following your muse, riding high and on your game,
        invulnerable, the chosen one, to &#8230; nothing. And you were powerless to
        do anything. <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-7-FNOTE-6">[]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-7-FNOTE-6">[]</a></sup> Quite the Catch-22 when you think of it: either you reach
            for the sun, Icarus-style, or you go nowhere. Yet there's always
            the risk of flying too high. I was among those who didn't reach:
            when my manager said to me, "We were thinking about you in a
            management position &#8230; ." I essentially responded with a "Who, me?"
            Probably not the best answer if you're looking to move up in the
            world.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Even with these issues and non-issues, however, the My.MP3.com
        service launched with very few issues. We went live just after
        midnight January 12, 2000, one day after we were supposed to release
        the site. The biggest issue we encountered was that only about half
        the servers were actually displaying the new
        content when we first pushed the site live, but before too long
        everything was going smooth as silk.</p>
<p class="docText">And the company? Well, the folks who were there at least, which
        was most of engineering, were ecstatic. There was beer and champagne,
        and people standing around in case they were needed, almost paralyzed
        in wonderment at what the future was about to bring.</p>
