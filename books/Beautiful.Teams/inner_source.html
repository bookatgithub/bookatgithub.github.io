<p class="docText">It has always amazed us that some <a name="idx-CHP-8-0199"></a>of the largest, most successful open <a name="idx-CHP-8-0200"></a>source projects like Linux, Firefox, and Apache release
        high-quality software under conditions that would cause most teams to
        crash and burn. They have large (sometimes huge) teams that are
        distributed all over the world and that rely on a lot of the work to
        be done by unpaid or undercompensated volunteers: programmers,
        testers, and other team members. That's why we wanted to talk to Auke

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: You've spent a lot of time
      looking at how open source projects work, and how companies can learn
      from that. How did that start?</span><a name="idx-CHP-8-0201"></a><a name="idx-CHP-8-0202"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: I started work in the
      research department at a large European multinational. I was working at
      one of the laboratories in the software architecture group, where most
      were focused on the architectural aspects of building software.</p>
<p class="docText">I recognized that there are a number of spectacular successes in
      open source but also a huge number of complete failures. For instance,
      Apache beat the big players on the web server market&mdash;IBM and
      Microsoft&mdash;despite those trying very hard to win at the time, in an
      effort to gain control of the web standards. At the same time, the vast
      majority of projects on open source development sites are dormant, one
      person efforts that haven't gone anywhere. In other words, there is
      something to learn from open source and it is not trivial.</p>
<p class="docText">The company I worked for was and is good in software architectures
      for software intensive product families, but could learn a lot from open
      source communities about software processes, in particular on how to
      collaborate across organizational boundaries. I studied open source
      software development and worked on how to deploy key aspects of open
      source development inside a company scope. I then went on to a product
      division where we rolled out my <a name="idx-CHP-8-0203"></a>inner source ideas and introduced a new development
      environment, CollabNet, to enable this inner source development. After
      two years rolling out those ideas, I was ready for a new challenge and
      joined CollabNet itself to do similar things for other
      organizations.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Can you tell us a little about one of the
      projects you studied? Maybe one where you saw team-related problems that
      they had to overcome?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: One of the projects which
      I studied in quite a bit of detail was the <a name="idx-CHP-8-0204"></a>KMail project, which is a mail reader under the KDE
      desktop environment. That was an impressive project with some 20 people,
      some interesting characters that had some run-ins with each other where
      they didn't quite agree. For example, one wanted to be project lead, and
      the rest didn't quite agree with that. It was interesting to see how
      they handled such a conflict.</p>
<p class="docText">It was also interesting to see how they handled development. And
      at some point, they had separate work that they started linking in. They
      wanted to enable users to encrypt messages. They used a standard
      encryption implementation, and made an interface to make sure that you
      can actually hook into it. There I recognized how the team was working
      together with other teams. And they have various ways of
      collaborating.</p>
<p class="docText">I studied the projects from the outside, not actually
      participating in the teams. And I came up with a set of what I
      considered the key aspects of what makes an open source project
      successful. And the next step, of course, was to roll that out within a
      real production environment in an enterprise.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: It sounds like you looked at
      how the people interacted with each other, and not just at the software
      they built. What do you think makes open source team members work
      together the way they do?</span><a name="idx-CHP-8-0205"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: What you see in open
      source is that people always go through certain evolutions. They
      typically don't start as a developer in an open source project. Nine out
      of 10 people start out using the software as is, and then at some point
      some of them start tweaking a bit with it, and then they become expert
      users, and then some of them go on to start contributing to the project,
      and then they evolve to become a developer. And what you see in
      successful projects is that they treat the people in a way to help and
      stimulate that evolution. So, you will always see that in a successful
      open source project, it's very easy for people to submit defect reports.
      They make it very easy&mdash;they help people if they run into issues, and
      spend time helping them figure out what the issue is. Both because they
      consider it in their own best interest and because it enables this
      evolution, to evolve from user to expert user to contributor to
      developer.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: That's interesting, because a lot of people have
      to approach software projects without understanding the domain of the
      problem that they're solving. You're saying one of the things that helps
      open source projects be successful is that they know the software as a
      user before they're actually involved in making changes to
      it.</span><a name="idx-CHP-8-0206"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: Yes. What I've seen by
      far the most is that people start using it first. And then they start
      contributing to it, and then they start developing it. And, of course,
      there are orders of magnitudes of difference. Typically tens of
      developers, hundreds if not thousands of contributors, and then tens of
      thousands or hundreds of thousands of users.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So let's say you're in a corporate environment,
      where you don't have that kind of ability for the developers to start
      off as users. Is there anything you can do to get at least some of the
      benefit of what you're talking about? Because that seems like a
      fundamental difference between a lot of open source projects and the
      sort of projects you'll be assigned if you're a professional developer
      in a company.</span><a name="idx-CHP-8-0207"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: Well, so I saw two sides
      to it, and you see this in the enterprise as well. One side of open
      source is the software engineering, and what the key aspects of open
      development are. Number one, you get <a name="idx-CHP-8-0208"></a>openness, and there's a number of things you can do to
      make development open. One is, of course, to make it easy to see all of
      the development efforts, and in an enterprise everything currently
      defaults to not being accessible. So, you don't get to somebody else's
      project, even if you're in the same company, in the same department.
      Information is not accessible unless you have a specific need for it and
      explicitly arranged to get access to it.</p>
<p class="docText">If I'm in a team, and you want to start using this component that
      I'm building, it's quite likely that you'll need to adapt it to use it.
      For me to make it easy for you to do that, I could make regular
      snapshots that I verified build and passed some level of testing, to
      save you and other potential contributors time in
      getting up to speed. In other words, I am making it more open by making
      it easier to access whatever I'm building. And by that I'm stimulating a
      lot <a name="idx-CHP-8-0209"></a>of people to start reusing.</p>
<p class="docText">So one side is software engineering, and the other side is
      "<a name="idx-CHP-8-0210"></a>community governance," if you will. And those two, you
      have to play correctly to get a successful open <a name="idx-CHP-8-0211"></a>source project. Nine out of 10 enterprises only do the
      software engineering, and management covers what is done through
      "community governance" in open source.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Let's say somebody's reading this right now and
      thinking to themselves, "Wow, the way you describe a 'closed' enterprise
      is exactly what I see at work every day, and I would love to get my
      company to have more of an open source model." But they have no idea
      where to start. What would you tell them? What advice would you give
      them? How do you get from point A to point B&mdash;what steps would you
      take?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: That company I worked for
      is a good sample case. Everything around deciding who works on what, and
      all the project management, all the software strategy, road mapping,
      requirements management, commitments made to customers, that just stays
      in place as it has always been. But the real engineering approach, that
      starts to change fundamentally.</p>
<p class="docText">There are a couple of things that you need to do. I identified
      three key aspects. One is openness, or ease of access to all information
      relevant to development. That means source code, tracking,
      documentation, and developer communication. In addition, it means making
      it easy to get to the information. So, keep it in a central, easy to
      access location and not require people to jump through three hoops of
      burning fire before they get to the information.</p>
<p class="docText">Second, we introduced a clearly defined ownership and control: the
      team developing and maintaining a component owns and controls it while
      another team adapting it to their needs owns the patch. This is standard
      in open source but ownership and control of components is commonly not
      clearly defined in enterprise development projects, especially on the
      border of two teams collaborating.</p>
<p class="docText">Third, with the relevant information and assets accessible and
      ownership and control defined, we stimulated teams to start adapting, or
      patching, another team's component rather than working around and
      writing glue code to make it fit. Those are the three engineering
      aspects that you can start rolling out.</p>
<p class="docText">At our company, that was about 120 developers split across two
      locations that built a product. Basically, what they did was developed
      lots of components that were reused across multiple products. These 120
      people were building the components. And then there were about 350
      people around it working on product teams, actually building end
      products out of it. So, when we got there to introduce it, we gradually
      rolled out those key aspects, opening up access to all parts of the
      development, defining ownership and control clearly, and stimulating a
      patching approach, combined with a whole lot of "evangelizing" the
      different groups involved. It needs to be an evolution, gradually making
      more information available while educating teams on the collaboration
      model, before getting one or two teams to start collaborating in that
      model. They then become an example for others.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And how did they respond
      when you first talked to them?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: Well, there was a lot
      <a name="idx-CHP-8-0212"></a>of <a name="idx-CHP-8-0213"></a>politics. This product family was <a name="idx-CHP-8-0214"></a>forced, in a sense, by the executive management that said
      that this was good for the division, so we have to force this through.
      There had to be some level of force applied to make sure that anything
      happens. But the price you pay is the people inside those teams&mdash;the ones
      that are being forced to start introducing the common components built
      by another team instead of using their own implementation&mdash;are not very
      happy that this is forced upon them. They would have wanted to have that
      choice entirely themselves. But, of course, they never would have taken
      that choice. So, there's always a bit of a chicken and egg problem: they
      have to apply some force, and that gets a lot of negative
      responses.</p>
<p class="docText">So, when I first started these things, there were a lot of
      negative responses, basically because the product teams didn't trust the
      product family teams.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, tension between teams was already thin when
      you started?</span><a name="idx-CHP-8-0215"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: Yes. For instance, the
      product family program had made commitments to the product teams. And in
      the product teams, the minute I started talking to them, even though I
      was an outsider&mdash;I wasn't part of the product family either&mdash;their instant
      knee-jerk reaction was, "OK, so now that the product family wants to
      introduce an open method so that they no longer have to support us, they
      can just break commitments, and we have to fix it ourselves."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: How did you convince them otherwise? How did you
      get around that, knock down that resistance?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: There was a whole lot of
      talking and explaining how this model works. The commitments were not
      changed in any way, shape, or form. In this case, the teams having tried
      to collaborate in a closed model for years had been slow to pick up the
      pace with this. There were other guys that were new to this product
      family that had just been acquired, and they didn't have the history.
      And there we found a good entry point, where they started to work with
      the product family in this open fashion. So there was one part to go
      through it, to get somebody else to demonstrate it, and then they would
      start seeing it in the other team as well.</p>
<p class="docText">Initially, the product teams didn't respond much and primarily
      just observed the initiative, how we were going through it. The initial
      main focus was to start opening up the whole <a name="idx-CHP-8-0216"></a>development. First we made the <a name="idx-CHP-8-0217"></a>source code read-only available inside this community.
      Then, we set up a mailing list on which everybody could ask questions,
      making the communication lines accessible. Up until that point,
      everybody had to ask questions to the "support team." This was a group
      that had a difficult job: they were basically in between a rock and a
      hard place. They received questions, and then they had to go look for
      somebody in the platform team&mdash;that team of 120 people&mdash;to find the person
      who's the expert on it, and then get the answer and get it back. So,
      they're the intermediaries, and there were always lots of details lost
      in translation. And, of course, the result is that the support didn't
      work so well.</p>
<p class="docText">A key observation that enterprise development
      can learn from open source development is that you typically cannot
      reuse somebody else's component without adapting it. Nine out <a name="idx-CHP-8-0218"></a>of 10 cases, you need to adapt it to your needs.
      <a name="idx-CHP-8-0219"></a>And that's what they ran into here as well. The common
      components fit maybe 80%, never 100%. They had a lot of pain. If they
      asked questions, they'd come to the support team who didn't have the
      answer themselves. They'd have to go look for it, and often just
      couldn't find it. So, the product teams were extremely frustrated. They
      were forced on board, and then had the problem of getting it to work
      without a decent support level.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: But it's not enough to just install mailing
      lists, right? A lot of companies have mailing lists that aren't all that
      effective.</span><a name="idx-CHP-8-0220"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: By simply introducing
      mailing lists, the support team still had the responsibilities
      organizationally, so initially it didn't change anything. But a number
      of more senior developers, I got them to subscribe to the list and they
      started answering questions. And before you know it, the support group
      became obsolete. Basically. they could start doing other things&mdash;they
      could go to development work, rather than trying to find answers to
      questions. There was no longer somebody in the middle. Now everybody
      could start communicating correctly. The product team asked a question,
      they got an answer much quicker, a much better answer because there was
      no issue with this lost-in-translation part, where you were
      communicating with a third person that just never worked so well. In
      turn, this took away a lot of the distrust and misunderstanding between
      the teams. In addition, it brought our <a name="idx-CHP-8-0221"></a>inner source initiative a lot of credibility because they
      noticed a tangible improvement that was clearly connected to inner
      source.</p>
<p class="docText">The problem with many generic collaboration initiatives in large
      companies is that it is generic, not domain-specific. This inevitably
      ends up with enthusiastic people publishing tons of information, but
      without much focus and not easy to find. The difference with this
      initiative is that this is very focused around the particular set of
      common components and the development and maintenance of those. All
      people in the community are using, adapting, or developing the
      components. That focus makes the difference. It is one thing to be able
      to talk, but you also need something to talk about.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That's great! Once you got the senior guys to
      play ball, you were able to take this support group and make their jobs
      more satisfying, and give them much more important, real work to do that
      would be better for the whole company.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: Yes. That made a huge,
      direct impact. It's a very tiny thing to do. It's really not rocket
      science to introduce a mailing list and to make source code available.
      But it had a huge impact and built a lot of credibility.</p>
<p class="docText">In the meantime, I kept doing this evangelizing thing, where I
      kept reiterating the same key aspects and the value it provided to the
      person I was talking to. The other thing that I did was that I gave it a
      name&mdash;the "inner source" initiative&mdash;that turned out to be a good
      buzzword. What always happens is that when other people hear about it,
      initially they don't understand it at all. They just hear the term, and
      they repeat the term without knowing what other
      people are talking about. But it serves a purpose, to have a name like
      that. Because then once they start talking about it, then at some point
      they also start getting it. Just giving it a name makes a difference
      there as well.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: What made you start the inner source
      project?</span><a name="idx-CHP-8-0222"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: I started inner source
      because I knew open source delivered a number <a name="idx-CHP-8-0223"></a>of spectacular successes and a huge number of failures. In
      other words, there is something to learn and it is not trivial.</p>
<p class="docText">There are three <a name="idx-CHP-8-0224"></a>key aspects that in my view make the difference between
      successful and unsuccessful projects. The first is easy access and
      openness: making all development-related information easy to access,
      like using mailing lists for communication, making source code and
      tracking accessible, and providing snapshot builds to make it easy for
      somebody else to adapt and tinker with your component. The second is a
      clearly defined <a name="idx-CHP-8-0225"></a>ownership and control of the component and the patches on
      a component: making it clear who's responsible for what. A component's
      owner controls what goes into his component. A team adapting a component
      controls their patch and decides whether they want to offer it to the
      component owner, and the component owner decides whether to accept it
      into his component, effectively transferring ownership of the patch. And
      the third is that open source projects default to patching instead of
      workarounds.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That seems like a big change from how most
      companies do their work. How did you get there?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: To deploy the approach, I
      did three things in parallel. First, I gradually opened up access to the
      development assets. So, I started by introducing the mailing lists, then
      making the source available, then providing snapshot builds, and so on.
      Second, I had ongoing, almost relentless evangelizing: with great
      regularity I took the time to visit key people throughout all teams to
      reiterate how the approach should work and what it will bring them and
      to actively seek their feedback. And third, I actively supported the
      first teams that adapted or patched another team's component.</p>
<p class="docText">An additional challenge that is currently common in enterprises is
      the need to replace their existing development infrastructure with a
      next generation infrastructure that enables <a name="idx-CHP-8-0226"></a>collaboration. We had to replace the legacy
      infrastructure, IBM Rational, with a next generation, CollabNet, to
      enable the development community to collaborate across organizational
      boundaries and locations in an easy, secure manner. The previous
      generation infrastructures hampers <a name="idx-CHP-8-0227"></a>collaboration (understandably so&mdash;they date back to a time
      in which this was not a requirement and they have not been designed to
      facilitate that).</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And you came up with the name "inner
      source."</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: That worked very well,
      just giving it a name. I did all of the rounds within the company's
      internal conferences, where every single conference&mdash;whether it was just
      the research department or the whole of the company&mdash;telling the story
      <a name="idx-CHP-8-0228"></a>of inner source was creating a buzz within the company.
      And it's a huge company, so that was a lot of work, creating
      a buzz and getting visibility. That worked very well. And <a name="idx-CHP-8-0229"></a>of course, every chance I got I talked about it, and
      talked to especially those product teams around the product family
      program. Doing that for about a year or so, that started paying off.
      They started crediting the <a name="idx-CHP-8-0230"></a>inner source initiative with that positive influence. And
      then they started to take it seriously.</p>
<p class="docText">In the meantime, we also introduced much more <a name="idx-CHP-8-0231"></a>openness. We started by making all the source code
      available, but then there are next steps to be taken as well. We also
      started making the communication open&mdash;not just the mailing list for
      support, but also for developers. So, all of the development discussions
      also started being on a mailing list. If you're on a product team, now
      you can follow the discussion the developers have. We made the tracking
      information much more accessible. And we introduced something that we
      called <a name="idx-CHP-8-0232"></a>snapshot builds. That had been quite a battle as well with
      the product family team, because it's considerable work to provide a
      weekly snapshot build, or a biweekly one. Basically, you build a version
      of the whole set of common components to make it easy for the people
      around the product teams to work with and adapt a very recent version of
      the common components, in turn making it more likely for a patch to make
      it back into the main line. That's what we pushed through as well. And
      once that started being part of the standard process, once we had that
      automated, it also made a big impact because it made it easier for
      people to start adapting and, with that, using common components and
      increase the chance of a patch being accepted back into the main
      line.</p>
<p class="docText">Another thing we added was to write some key <a name="idx-CHP-8-0233"></a>documentation. Really successful open source projects
      always had three distinct <a name="idx-CHP-8-0234"></a>levels of documentation. They call it different things at
      times, or organize it differently, but they had three distinct levels.
      One is a README: what is the project about, and who's involved. The
      second level is how you start using it: how you install it, what are the
      runtime dependencies. It doesn't explain it in extraordinary detail. It
      just says, "This is how you typically start using this." And the third
      level is contributor information: how you build new versions of the
      software yourself, what kind of dependencies you need, and how you
      contribute something. Note that this fits the three distinct types of
      people involved in a community: users, contributors, and committers. The
      README helps people decide if they want to become users, the install
      information helps people to become users, and the contributor
      information helps a user become a contributor.</p>
<p class="docText">That's what we see in successful open source projects, and we
      copied it inside the enterprise. And again, that made a big difference.
      For instance, when I first arrived with the teams, I took a standard
      development machine from that same department, and tried but couldn't
      get it to build. Which meant a developer at a product team would most
      likely not be able to get it to build either&mdash;there was clearly
      information missing. I had to ask three different developers before I
      got it working. We worked out a short document that clearly defined the
      runtime and build-time dependencies and outlined how to build and run.
      It all goes back to making it <span class="docEmphasis">easy</span> to use and adapt
      to your needs.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, making your company more
      open changed the way the teams did their work. But did it have any real
      effect on the way they designed their software?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: There is a fundamental
      difference between open source and the enterprise. In my opinion, open
      source actually found out how to properly reuse software, while
      enterprises are still learning it. What you see in the enterprise is
      that they try to design for reuse. Theoretically, that is great, but
      typically you don't know and cannot foresee exactly how software will be
      reused. The only thing you really know for certain when you start
      building software is that it's going to be different than you think, and
      it's going to be basically used differently and work differently than
      you had initially envisioned.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, designing for reuse isn't always a great
      thing?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: It's not really a very
      suitable approach for software development. What you typically do in
      open source is that you start by building something for one use first.
      Then, somebody else takes it and starts modifying to their needs. And he
      can reuse it. And once you've done that&mdash;use and reuse&mdash;you know what the
      commonality is, and you can refactor out the common
      functionality.</p>
<p class="docText">That pattern you see quite a lot. Design for reuse is too static.
      It doesn't work that way and is a very poor fit. It may be something to
      strive for, but is not feasible in the foreseeable future. Use-use-reuse
      is a much better fit.</p>
<p class="docText">So, you basically build software for one case first. And you do
      this in the enterprise as well. At the company, they first built a
      certain algorithm or a certain feature in one product. Then they started
      evolving so they could use it in other products as well. To do this, you
      needed a much more open process to actually enable this evolution. And
      that's what we essentially did with inner source.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, you can't design for reuse? That seems a
      little drastic.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auke</span>: You can still design for
      reuse, of course. But my thesis is that whatever you're designing for,
      it's always a moving target, so it's never going to be a good fit. And
      that's also in part because while you're building and designing it,
      you're actually learning much more about it, and that leads to changing
      it as well. In essence, open source and inner source make it very easy
      to pick up something that fits closely but not entirely and adapt it for
      your own needs.</p>
<p class="docText">What a lot of enterprises have today is just closed source so that
      if you work on some software, I can't see anything of it. If I ask you
      for it, you'll send some installable binaries. You might send the source
      code, but you'll only send one version of the source code, and it's
      probably a stable release that's half a year old. So, I'm not going to
      touch that, because if I start touching it, I'm on my own. I can't feed
      this back to you because it's so outdated, so you won't take the time to
      incorporate it in your software, and I can't get to the leading edge
      easily.</p>
