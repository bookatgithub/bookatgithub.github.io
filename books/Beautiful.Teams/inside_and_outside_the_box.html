<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Patricia Ensworth</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">OUR STORY TAKES PLACE IN NEW YORK CITY. AS
      WITH MOST NEW YORK DRAMAS, THE PLOT REVOLVES</span> around real
      estate.</p>
<p class="docText">The main character is an office building in Lower Manhattan, a
      bland 12-story box constructed soon after World War II whose afternoon
      sunlight was eclipsed a quarter century later by the towers of the World
      Trade Center. The building has the honor of being the only authentic,
      intact, and unadulterated element of this pseudomemoir. Lawyers and
      colleagues please take note: all else (the company, the people, the
      events, the narrator) is a collage of facts which individually are true
      but collectively are fictional.</p>
<p class="docText">I first laid eyes on the building during my job interview at
      Pharaoh Investment Guides, Inc. I was applying for a position as a
      <a name="idx-CHP-29-0898"></a>software tester, and as soon as I walked in the door, I
      liked the feel of the place. Although Pharaoh was a world-class
      publishing company specializing in financial news and analysis, an
      international dynamo with offices around the globe, its headquarters
      seemed serene and friendly. The outside of the building might have been
      plain, but the inside was tastefully decorated, the lobby resplendent
      with gilt and marble architectural detail. People smiled and greeted
      each other in the hallways like residents of a small town.</p>
<p class="docText">The hiring manager, Jacob, was a thin,
      scholarly, nervous man who supervised the development on Pharaoh's
      book-formatting system.</p>
<p class="docText">"We don't have any full-time testers now," he admitted. "We hired
      a guy last year, but after a few months he decided he wanted to be a
      developer instead. Mostly our end users and clients have been doing the
      testing. I can't give you the details unless you come on board, but
      they've missed a few things that came very close to putting us out of
      business. We need somebody to come in and help us implement a more
      structured approach."</p>
<p class="docText">He squinted at my resume. "So&#8230;you have a master's degree in
      anthropology. Did you get involved with computers on an archeological
      dig or something?"</p>
<p class="docText">I explained that I had studied the structure and function of
      cultural systems with a focus on business activities. During graduate
      school I had earned money by writing <a name="idx-CHP-29-0899"></a>software documentation, and then by testing software. I
      discovered that I had a knack for writing test cases based upon an
      analysis of how human beings used the software as a tool to communicate
      within their own cultural systems. I was currently employed by a global
      financial services firm to run usability tests on software that had been
      developed in the United States and would be deployed in its
      international offices. However, there had been a reorganization, and I
      didn't like my new boss.</p>
<p class="docText">To my surprise and delight, Pharaoh offered me the job. I had
      gotten along well with Jacob and was looking forward to working for him,
      but the Friday before the Monday I was supposed to start, he called me
      with some disturbing news.</p>
<p class="docText">"Sorry about this, but I'm leaving. I got a great offer from an
      Internet start-up in Silicon Valley. Today is my last day. Don't
      worry&mdash;you'll do fine here."</p>
<p class="docText">On Monday morning, the person who came to pick me up at the
      reception desk was an elegant, statuesque African-American woman about
      my own age. She introduced herself as Barbara, the project manager for
      the editorial systems. I followed her into an elevator and up to her
      area on the 6th floor, where I met the PMs for the other applications.
      Louise, a plump, grandmotherly, former human resources manager, looked
      after the HR systems amid a forest of lovingly tended plants. The PM for
      all internal and external web-based applications was Caitlin, whose
      tight skirt and low-cut blouse, stiletto heels, long manicured
      fingernails, and glamorous haircut made me wonder by what path she had
      arrived in the realm of software engineering. The fourth PM was Nick,
      and he worked on the production systems that fed the publications to the
      printers and websites. Nick told me that he had served in the Air Force
      during the first Gulf War&mdash;a fact corroborated by his erect posture, his
      clean-cut appearance, and his respectful demeanor.</p>
<p class="docText">From this informal PMO Gang of Four, I learned that in addition to
      the systems they worked with, there were a few others whose development
      teams got along without any project manager: the financial systems, the
      sales systems, and the internal reporting systems. Pharaoh did not
      follow a defined methodology for project management or software
      engineering. The project managers' role was limited to coordinating
      resources, monitoring budgets, and filling out
      status reports. The real power resided with the executive director-level
      development managers to whom the project managers and developers all
      reported.</p>
<p class="docText">"So, who am I reporting to?" I finally asked.</p>
<p class="docText">There was an awkward silence.</p>
<p class="docText">"Jacob hired me," I went on. "He said he was lead developer on the
      <a name="idx-CHP-29-0900"></a>software that formats the content for the books. Is that
      editorial or production?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Production," Nick replied. "But there has been a reorganization.
      The ED who was development manager for internal reporting was promoted
      to managing director of systems development. All the EDs now report to
      him. Did you meet Dave?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Probably," I said, trying to recall all the people who had
      interviewed me during my three visits to Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="docText">"Dave thinks there is a greater need for testing on the sales
      systems," Barbara said. "But the ED who is dev manager for those systems
      doesn't agree. And there is no PM in that area."</p>
<p class="docText">"So who <span class="docEmphasis">am</span> I reporting to?" I asked
      again.</p>
<p class="docText">"The dev manager for sales systems," Caitlin smirked. "His name is
      Scott."</p>
<p class="docText">Sensing the onset of an anxiety attack, I forced myself to take
      several slow, deep breaths.</p>
<p class="docText">"Let me get this straight," I said. "My new boss is a development
      manager I've never met who doesn't think he needs a software
      tester."</p>
<p class="docText">Louise patted my hand. "It's only temporary. Things will get
      sorted out, you'll see."</p>
<p class="docText">Nestled under Barbara's protective wing, I was taken around and
      introduced or reintroduced to various members of the systems development
      group, and then delivered to my new manager's doorstep. Scott's lair was
      located midway along a corridor of identical offices, but it stood out
      from the others because it was dim. Its occupant had unscrewed the
      fluorescent bulbs in the ceiling, substituting a stylish, high-tech
      halogen lamp on his desk and a Tiffany-shaded living room lamp on the
      credenza. An Indian mask hung on one wall&mdash;Tlingit or Haida, I
      guessed&mdash;across from some framed underwater photos. The room smelled of
      stale cigarette smoke.</p>
<p class="docText">Scott himself stood out from the other denizens of software
      development in that he seemed dazzlingly overdressed: suit pants with a
      sharp crease, business shirt, tie, cufflinks, shoes polished to a glossy
      shine. At the time, I jumped to the conclusion that he must have been in
      costume for a presentation to senior management, but I soon found out
      that it was his everyday attire. He seemed to be in his mid-30s, average
      build, fit, with thick, longish brown hair, brown eyes, and a space
      between his front teeth. He was handsome, but not my type.</p>
<p class="docText">I sat down in the chair opposite his desk
      with my left hand on my knee to display my wedding ring. He opened the
      credenza and took out a notepad. Before he closed the door I spotted a
      pack of cigarettes and a half-full bottle of vodka.</p>
<p class="docText">We regarded each other in silence for a moment. Eventually he
      bared his teeth in a sort of smile, though his eyes remained
      unfriendly.</p>
<p class="docText">"So&#8230;you're our new scapegoat," he said.</p>
<p class="docText">It was an inauspicious beginning, but things did indeed gradually
      get sorted out. After Scott ignored me for a couple of weeks, hoping I'd
      go away, Dave (the managing director) intervened. Though I would
      continue to be responsible for testing the sales systems, he reassigned
      me to report to Nick the project manager, and he told Scott bluntly to
      change his attitude.</p>
<p class="docText">Scott managed the development of three sales applications: a
      content management database for the sales force, a database of marketing
      analytics, and an order fulfillment system. As an entry-level developer
      several years earlier, he had designed and built all three based upon
      requirements given to him by a friend in the marketing department. The
      applications had been very successful, and the business sponsor had been
      promoted to vice president of sales and marketing. Scott had been
      promoted, too. Each application now employed its own lead developer and
      a couple of junior developers.</p>
<p class="docText">However, Scott was in way over his head. He had been an excellent
      developer, but during his ascent to the ED position, he never had the
      time or inclination to learn about <a name="idx-CHP-29-0901"></a>software engineering or project management. The high rate
      of failures and defects in his systems was the result not of shoddy
      code, but of chaotic development processes. His stellar reputation was
      based upon the fact that he would do anything to please his user
      community, including developing a unique version of the application for
      a single individual and personally installing it on that user's
      computer.</p>
<p class="docText">It didn't take long for me to realize that Scott knew he had
      crawled out on a dangerously weak limb and was worried that it would
      break underneath him. If he fell from his lofty ED perch, his wealthy,
      prominent family who had been disgusted by his decision to play around
      with computers rather than go to law school would be able to gloat.
      Also, everyone he worked with was aware that he drank enough beer at
      lunch and vodka at his desk to qualify as a borderline alcoholic.</p>
<p class="docText">Fundamentally, I liked Scott. I thought he was smart, hardworking,
      creative, and honest. Nick encouraged me to address the process issues
      plaguing the sales system. But I couldn't get through the fortress of
      Scott's defenses with my test strategy or defect metrics, and my
      patience finally wore out. One day when he came back woozy after lunch,
      I confronted him.</p>
<p class="docText">"Scott, I wish I could convince you that we're both on the same
      side," I told him. "I'm not here to spy on you for Dave, or criticize
      you, or undermine you. I'm supposed to be making you and your team look
      good. Like a coach, or an editor. I really do want to help."</p>
<p class="docText">Perhaps Scott sensed that I was on the verge
      of quitting and worried about Dave's reaction, or perhaps he felt he had
      nothing to lose by changing course. Whatever the reason, after that day
      we were no longer adversaries and instead became colleagues.</p>
<p class="docText">Ironically, I was now in over my head, too. I knew how to create,
      execute, and report on tests&mdash;but the <a name="idx-CHP-29-0902"></a>software engineering and project management process
      improvements demanded knowledge I did not already possess. I bought
      books, and my fourth-grade daughter and I studied together in the
      evening. Nick supported my training requests and Dave approved the
      budget. My husband put in extra hours for housework and child care while
      I took classes and attended conferences.</p>
<p class="docText">Over the next few months we made slow but noticeable progress.
      Working closely with the eight sales systems developers, Scott and I
      tackled configuration management, version control, change management,
      and defect tracking methods. It was a struggle, but there were many
      moments of humor in between the fights, and we grew to respect each
      other's judgment. I felt like a physical therapist whose patient finally
      starts doing the necessary exercises on his own, and the improvements
      showed in the declining defect rates. Our most contentious episodes
      involved the concepts of code freeze and feature freeze. Nick was very
      helpful in my crusade against scope creep: he was firm and unflappable,
      and had the kind of mature perspective on day-to-day crises that
      probably comes from surviving in an actual combat zone.</p>
<p class="docText">Other ED development managers began to take an interest. I was
      asked to help hire and train testers for their systems. Within a
      three-month period, Irene took on the financial systems (accounts
      payable, accounts receivable, billing, cash management), Randall joined
      the operations team (editorial, production, internal reporting, legal,
      HR), and Felipe signed on to the web development juggernaut. Louise the
      project manager was reassigned from HR to financials, and Irene reported
      to her. Randall reported to Barbara, Felipe reported to Caitlin, and I
      continued to report to Nick. Though on the organization chart the PMs
      and testers were all dispersed among development groups supporting
      different lines of business, in practice, Barbara was team captain of
      the PMs and I became team captain of the testers.</p>
<p class="docText">It was an interesting and enjoyable time. All the new testers
      brought in fresh ideas and approaches, and since both Irene and Felipe
      came from well-known software vendors their expectations helped raise
      the bar for standards across the entire group. Dave permitted every
      development team to establish its own practices, so there were no
      serious turf battles.</p>
<p class="docText">Our office building fostered a sense of community. There was a
      cafeteria&mdash;its food wasn't great, but it provided a neutral and
      comfortable place to get together for purposes ranging from impromptu
      discussions with developers to inter-team Scrabble tournaments. The
      fitness center in the basement enabled us to sweat out stress and
      exchange a few words with end users. The library was a welcome sanctuary
      from the hubbub around the cubicles for anyone who needed peace and
      quiet to read, write, or think. Another popular hideout was a vast,
      empty two-story storage space on the ground floor that had once housed a
      bank branch. Though it lay behind a heavy locked
      door, everyone knew the security code for the buttons&mdash;as well as the
      unwritten code about not interrupting or disclosing anything illicit
      that went on in there.</p>
<p class="docText">Yes, things were going well, productivity and morale were
      high&#8230;until Scott's girlfriend broke up with him.</p>
<p class="docText">Suddenly, Scott was morose and irritable, and began taking longer
      liquid lunches. He and I had never talked about our personal lives much,
      so I heard the news from Randall, who had become Scott's workout buddy
      at the fitness center. The lead developers on the sales applications
      complained to me that Scott had begun radically revising their
      <a name="idx-CHP-29-0903"></a>software, as if by immersing himself in coding again he
      could distract himself from his troubles.</p>
<p class="docText">One Thursday evening, the entire systems development group was
      invited to a party at Windows on the World celebrating a major release
      of Pharaoh's public website. It was fun, and the sunset view of the
      harbor was spectacular, but I had to leave while the party was in full
      swing because I needed to get home and relieve my babysitter.</p>
<p class="docText">The following day Scott was absent, our cubicle area was eerily
      quiet, and everyone in our group seemed tired, cranky, and hunkered
      down. Assuming that the average blood-alcohol level was still in the
      hangover zone, I went about my business and cleaned out my email
      folders.</p>
<p class="docText">But on Monday Scott's office was empty&mdash;as in vacant, cleaned out,
      devoid of all personal possessions. Even the fluorescent bulbs overhead
      were back on.</p>
<p class="docText">I found Anupam, the lead developer for the marketing analytics
      application, and asked him what happened. He shook his head, drew his
      finger across his throat, shrugged, and resumed typing.</p>
<p class="docText">My search for Nick brought me to the cafeteria, where he and
      Caitlin were finishing their breakfast. Without waiting to be invited I
      pulled up a chair.</p>
<p class="docText">"Hi there! Do either of you have any idea&mdash;"</p>
<p class="docText">"Would this be about Scott's untimely departure?" Nick
      inquired.</p>
<p class="docText">"Yes, it would."</p>
<p class="docText">Caitlin laughed. "You missed quite a scene at the party."</p>
<p class="docText">"Scott got totally shitfaced," Nick said. "He grabbed Dave in a
      headlock and started insulting him."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, I suppose physically attacking your boss could be grounds
      for termination," I said. "Did Scott complain about Dave's
      management?"</p>
<p class="docText">Caitlin laughed louder. "Not quite. He called Dave a pansy and
      said his only qualification for his current job was the fact that he's
      having an affair with Bob Wheeler."</p>
<p class="docText">"Wheeler? The head of the Latin American region? But he's married,
      and so is Dave."</p>
<p class="docText">Caitlin stopped laughing. She and Nick
      exchanged a world-weary glance, and then both of them looked at me
      pityingly.</p>
<p class="docText">I blushed, feeling like a kid who has been invited to sit at the
      grownups' table and then knocks over a burning candle.</p>
<p class="docText">"But this&#8230;this is incredible," I stammered.</p>
<p class="docText">"It gets better!" Nick said brightly. "Scott wouldn't let go, and
      Dave started to pass out, so Paul stepped up and punched him hard enough
      that he sailed backward into a table. Scott crawled away under his own
      power, but I hear he broke a few ribs. Dave's neck is sprained."</p>
<p class="docText">"Wow. And I thought I was having an exciting evening helping my
      daughter glue pictures onto poster board for her science
      project."</p>
<p class="docText">It was pretty hard to focus that day. Nick advised me to just keep
      on doing what I had been doing until the smoke cleared. I met with
      Anupam and the two other lead developers on the sales systems for a
      routine status update. Late in the afternoon, I received a call from
      Dave's chief of staff summoning me to his office at once.</p>
<p class="docText">The corner office Dave occupied was three times as large as any
      ED's office. I had never entered it before, and it seemed like a long
      way from the door past the couch and conference table to the chairs in
      front of his desk. A quick scan of the room turned up no family pictures
      or personal decorations except for a framed photo of a beagle. At Dave's
      gesture I sat down and squinted through the afternoon sunlight that
      shone directly into my eyes.</p>
<p class="docText">Dave was a small man in a large leather executive chair, and he
      was wearing an orthopedic collar around his neck. He had slender hands,
      delicate features, and fine blond hair gelled into a fixed flat plate. I
      had spoken with him a few times, but we had never engaged in a
      conversation of any length or substance. Now when he spoke to me his
      voice was so low and mild that I needed to lean forward to hear his
      words.</p>
<p class="docText">"You know, <a name="idx-CHP-29-0904"></a>software testing is considered an overhead cost," he began
      with a pleasant smile. "Sometimes, it's hard to demonstrate the value of
      it to the business. Quality assurance initiatives are always the first
      to go during budget cuts."</p>
<p class="docText">"I understand," I said. In fact, I was thoroughly confused because
      his words and his facial expression seemed contradictory.</p>
<p class="docText">Based upon these preliminary remarks, I assumed I was about to be
      laid off. However, the opposite happened: a promotion. Dave informed me
      that he wanted me to lead an official QA group. I would report directly
      to him. The testers would report 50% to their ED development managers
      and 50% to me.</p>
<p class="docText">In other organizational changes, Anupam the marketing analytics
      developer would replace Scott as development manager for the sales
      systems. A new project manager and a replacement tester for the sales
      systems would be hired. Following the same model as the QA group,
      Barbara was being promoted to lead a new Project Management
      Office.</p>
<p class="docText">The PMs would report 50% to their ED
      development managers and 50% to her. Dave expected Barbara and me to
      collaborate in implementing process improvements for project management
      and <a name="idx-CHP-29-0905"></a>software engineering across the group.</p>
<p class="docText">As Dave described my new role, I felt excited and honored but also
      a bit apprehensive. Reporting to him, I sensed, would be very different
      from reporting to Nick. Dave had no background in software engineering
      whatsoever. He was an MBA whose involvement as a "power user" of the
      internal financial reporting systems had persuaded the chief information
      officer that he would do a good job supervising the software
      development. At the ED development manager level he had surpassed his
      peers in delivering functionality on time and in controlling costs&mdash;but
      also in staff turnover.</p>
<p class="docText">It was a big shake-up. The development managers were reluctant to
      share the supervision of their testers and PMs with another manager. Our
      former peers felt awkward about reporting to Barbara and me. We were
      concerned about the matrix reporting relationship, and wondered how we
      would negotiate with the development managers about setting the PMs' and
      testers' priorities.</p>
<p class="docText">Among the new obligations Barbara and I acquired was attending
      Dave's biweekly status meetings for his direct reports. Before our first
      appearance, Dave asked each of us to prepare a presentation about our
      objectives and strategies. My anxiety over this debut performance
      reached the point where I needed to carry around a paper bag to breathe
      into when I started feeling dizzy. I knew exactly what I wanted to say,
      and I rehearsed it thoroughly with my family's patient coaching, but the
      idea of trying to persuade an entire group of development managers at
      once gave me terrible stage fright.</p>
<p class="docText">At the status meeting, I sat down at the conference table for the
      first time with EDs I knew only by reputation. In addition to Dave, his
      chief of staff, Barbara, and Anupam, there were four new colleagues I
      would soon be dealing with on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="docText">The ED for the financial systems, Mark, was a loose-limbed,
      easygoing, cheerful VB developer and RUP aficionado. At 35, he looked 10
      years younger. He had married his high school sweetheart immediately
      after college, and they had already produced three kids. Outside of
      work, his favorite pastime was leading his son's Boy Scout troop. He
      could always be counted upon to make generous contributions to whatever
      charity anyone was collecting for.</p>
<p class="docText">Glowering beside him was Paul, the ED for web development and the
      hulk who had broken Scott's ribs. A burly, overweight, but muscular
      powder keg of simmering resentment, he lived alone inside a den of
      electronic musical instruments and disassembled computers. In a brief
      hiatus from writing C++ code he had accidentally fathered an
      illegitimate child whose mother frequently sent him subpoenas. His spare
      time was devoted to riding his Harley in Adirondack Park. He was also
      the group's senior drug dealer.</p>
<p class="docText">Across the table sat Zvi, ED for the operations systems. Zvi was
      in his early 50s and had been around since Pharaoh's mainframe days. He
      was an Orthodox Jew who always dressed in a shapeless black suit and
      threadbare white open-collared shirt. He wore thick wire-rimmed
      glasses that made his eyes seem unnaturally large. As far as anyone
      knew, Zvi did not have any extracurricular hobbies because he lived with
      his wife and six children in Rockland County and had a two-hour commute
      each way. Zvi could sit absolutely still for an extraordinarily long
      time, and he was a very attentive listener. People from all the
      development teams who had difficult technical and political problems
      dropped by Zvi's office to ask his advice.</p>
<p class="docText">The fourth person I was formally introduced to that morning was
      Carol Chu. Unlike other managers who were referred to simply by their
      first names, everyone always said "Carol Chu" when talking about the ED
      for database development. Carol stood 4 feet 8 inches tall in her
      running shoes, and she was nearly always smiling. Born and raised in
      Shanghai, she had earned a Ph.D. in mathematics at Cal Tech. Her husband
      was a professor of physics and their 10-year-old son was a chess
      champion. It was said of her that within the terabytes of data stored on
      Pharaoh's servers, she knew the location of every pointer in every index
      at all times. Although she frequently sent email messages between 2:00
      and 5:00 a.m., she treated her staff kindly, like a large extended
      family, and she never missed an opportunity to celebrate their
      birthdays.</p>
<p class="docText">Following some chitchat about the Mets' dismal performance and the
      new falafel restaurant that had opened down the block, Dave called the
      meeting to order. He welcomed Anupam, Barbara, and me to the team, then
      his chief of staff distributed the agenda. It was Dave's first day
      without the orthopedic collar, and he made a lame joke about not
      sticking his neck out too far.</p>
<p class="docText">The first item on the agenda was a team realignment. Dave said he
      wanted Li, the lead developer on the contact management database, to
      switch roles with Rachel, the lead developer on the HR system.</p>
<p class="docText">"But we're just a few weeks away from a major rollout," Anupam
      protested. "Li has been working on this release for almost six
      months."</p>
<p class="docText">"Rachel also," Zvi said. "It's her first release since I promoted
      her. She's very excited and proud of her work. She'll be unhappy if she
      has to move now."</p>
<p class="docText">"But that's exactly my point," Dave said. "We don't want any of
      our developers to get too personally attached to their code or to a
      particular user community. This development group is a team, and I want
      every player to be prepared to rotate positions as I see fit."</p>
<p class="docText">In the silence that followed this speech, I glanced around the
      table, and from the body language I got the feeling that Dave the MD was
      not well liked by the EDs who reported to him.</p>
<p class="docText">My presentation went fine, though in truth it seemed nobody was
      paying very close attention. Afterward, there were a few polite
      questions, and Dave smiled at me, so I counted it a success and breathed
      easier.</p>
<p class="docText">But the job turned out to be much harder than I anticipated. If my
      process engineering efforts with Scott and the sales systems team had
      made me feel like a physical therapist, now I felt
      more like a community organizer. Apart from paying my salary, Dave
      provided very little support to me&mdash;and no incentives or penalties for
      the EDs to cooperate with me in achieving the QA goals. He evidently
      expected me to negotiate with each team and come up with standards and
      procedures that everyone could agree upon.</p>
<p class="docText">It was slow going, particularly when the EDs used the discussions
      to enact their turf battles. The testers who reported to me had their
      own agendas and aspirations. Yet we inched forward. We decided it was
      not feasible for all applications to use the same documents or follow
      the same methodology. In the end, we settled upon templates and
      checklists with mandatory and optional components for requirements
      definition, test planning, test execution, test results reporting,
      defect tracking, change control, version control, and configuration
      management.</p>
<p class="docText">Barbara was in a similar situation with her Project Management
      Office. In some respects, she had more clout because Dave's boss, the
      CIO, and the influential business sponsors of our <a name="idx-CHP-29-0906"></a>software wanted more insight into our group's development
      activities. In essence, they hoped to better understand how and where
      and why their money was being spent. Her first step was the introduction
      of a mandatory Scope Document for all new projects, along with a review
      process that determined funding, resourcing, and scheduling. When that
      innovation proved successful, it was followed by templates and
      checklists for the Work Breakdown Structure, Gantt Chart, Responsibility
      Matrix, Risk Matrix, Integrated Project Plan, and Closing Report.</p>
<p class="docText">After almost a year, Anupam, Barbara, and I were all promoted.
      Anupam became an ED, and Barbara and I rose to the rank of director. I
      got stock options and an interior office with a door.</p>
<p class="docText">Barbara and I celebrated with a shopping spree. It was the
      beginning of the holiday season, and I had discovered that our office
      building had a basement-level passage into the subway that continued to
      the underground concourse of the World Trade Center. We liked the WTC
      mall because its low ceilings gave it a cozy atmosphere. It offered a
      wide range of stores, from the mundane (shoe repair, photo processing,
      pharmacy) to the glamorous (clothing, electronics, jewelry). Best of
      all, it was a place to stroll around in bad weather. I bought a cocktail
      dress, Barbara bought some fancy boots, and we both bought necklaces for
      our daughters.</p>
<p class="docText">The economy was booming. Pharaoh's business was expanding rapidly.
      In mid-February, after the bonus checks had been handed out, Dave
      announced that to keep up with the demand for new functionality in our
      software, we would begin outsourcing maintenance. The plan envisioned
      that within a year, a third of our group's total headcount would
      comprise developers and testers who were employed by a vendor.
      Initially, these outsourced resources would be located here in our
      Pharaoh headquarters building, but eventually, they might be located at
      the vendor's facility elsewhere in the United States or offshore. No
      Pharaoh employees would lose their jobs.</p>
<p class="docText">There followed an intense round of vendor presentations, strategic
      sourcing meetings, and briefings by consultants. It seemed as though
      many of the important decisions were being made by
      procurement specialists and lawyers who knew very little about
      <a name="idx-CHP-29-0907"></a>software engineering. Anupam lobbied heavily for an Indian
      firm, but in the end our CIO selected Quogue Consulting based upon
      reviews in Gartner and Forrester reports and conversations with people
      in his own professional network.</p>
<p class="docText">A new face appeared at Dave's biweekly direct reports meeting.
      Frank, the service delivery manager for Quogue, was a weather-beaten man
      in his 40s with a jet black brush crew cut and a tic in his jaw. His
      forearms, biceps, and chest had the overinflated look of a serious
      weightlifter. During the meeting, he sat hunched over, taut like a
      coiled spring. We learned that Frank had been with Quogue for five
      years. Prior to that, he had served in the Navy, had worked as an
      operations manager on a rubber plantation in Malaysia, and had
      supervised the staff aboard a cruise ship. When the meeting adjourned,
      and we stood to go, I saw that around his neck he wore a medallion in
      the shape of a gargoyle.</p>
<p class="docText">On our way out he intercepted Barbara and me.</p>
<p class="docText">"Ladies." He was smiling, but his tone seemed more appropriate for
      a sailor in a brothel than a gentleman at a reception.</p>
<p class="docText">"Welcome," I said. "We look forward to working with you."</p>
<p class="docText">"I wanted to tell you that on my last engagement my team achieved
      CMM Level 3. I'd be glad to share our lessons learned with you if you're
      interested."</p>
<p class="docText">The arrogance and condescension in his voice irked me, but Barbara
      had the opposite reaction.</p>
<p class="docText">"That's great! Thank you. I'm sure we can learn a lot from your
      experience," she beamed.</p>
<p class="docText">The Quogue invasion commenced right away. My staff testers were
      redeployed to the applications with the largest product backlog of new
      functionality, while outsourced resources were brought in for changes to
      the more stable legacy systems. My tester for the sales systems had quit
      to go back to school, and Frank replaced her with Rafiq. Alex became the
      tester for the accounts payable and accounts receivable systems. Natalya
      joined the production systems team.</p>
<p class="docText">My involvement in the hiring process for these testers was: zero.
      The EDs and lead developers were likewise excluded from the recruitment
      of Quogue programmers. Following the "staff augmentation" model, Frank
      wanted us to provide job specifications and let him deliver warm bodies.
      He also insisted on managing the outsourced resources' workflow, so in
      the beginning, he attended all development team meetings and got copies
      of all emails regarding tasks to which his people were assigned. Partly
      this was because Quogue had its own internal tracking procedures, but it
      also seemed that he was looking for opportunities to point out our
      group's weaknesses to Dave so that he could make a sales pitch on how he
      could do things better and thereby expand Quogue's engagement. In
      particular, the lead developers considered Frank a nuisance, and they
      resented his obstructive behavior as gatekeeper when they were trying to
      integrate the outsourced resources into their projects and teams.</p>
<p class="docText">Meanwhile, Pharaoh's business continued
      growing. Soon it became evident that the data architecture implemented
      when the company was one-third its present size no longer adequately
      supported its operations and would seriously undermine future expansion.
      As much as everyone hated the idea of IT root canal surgery, we were
      compelled to redesign the central data warehouse and modify all the
      upstream and downstream systems. Just thinking about it made all the EDs
      break into a sweat. Our first requirements gathering and test planning
      meetings featured mood swings from hysteria to despair, followed by a
      mass updating of resumes.</p>
<p class="docText">On the bright side, it was an opportunity for me to lead a very
      large, mission-critical, cross-functional <a name="idx-CHP-29-0908"></a>testing project, and I was excited about the challenge. To
      ensure that the project management approach and the testing strategy
      aligned with the Quogue internal processes, Barbara and I began meeting
      regularly with Natalya and coordinating our teams' efforts.</p>
<p class="docText">Our most memorable meeting took place at lunchtime on a beautiful
      day in July&mdash;one of those rare summer days in New York when the humidity
      is low, the temperature is mild, the air is clean, and an ocean breeze
      reminds everyone that the city is a seaport. Unable to bear the thought
      of staying indoors, we got some food to go from the cafeteria and ate it
      by the sculpture in the World Trade Center plaza.</p>
<p class="docText">Natalya was slightly older than Barbara and I, perhaps in her
      early 40s. She had two children, a daughter who was a freshman in high
      school and a son in seventh grade. She was short and stocky, with a
      broad face, prominent eyes, and curly auburn hair. Originally from the
      Ukraine, she spoke heavily accented but fluent English. She lived with
      her family in Brooklyn and was in the process of buying a house on
      Staten Island. Her automated regression tests were the most compact and
      effective I'd ever seen.</p>
<p class="docText">Under the influence of the fine weather, we disposed of our
      business matters quickly and moved on to personal topics. We chatted
      about our daughters, our work/life balance or lack thereof, our
      difficulties with the public schools. Eventually I asked Natalya why she
      had left the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="docText">"I am from Chernobyl," she replied.</p>
<p class="docText">It took a moment for the implications of this fact to sink
      in.</p>
<p class="docText">"Were you evacuated?" Barbara asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"After a while. For many days we stayed. The government pretended
      nothing had happened. We found out the truth from the BBC radio. We left
      with one suitcase each and did not return."</p>
<p class="docText">"That must have been dreadful," I said. "And your health&#8230;?"</p>
<p class="docText">"So far so good. Many of our old neighbors have grown cancers. I
      do not care so much for myself, but I worry always about my
      children."</p>
<p class="docText">Soberly we pondered the helplessness of mothers in the face of the
      world's evils.</p>
<p class="docText">All of a sudden Natalya grinned and pointed
      at a stage on the west side of the plaza. "Oh, look! There is going to
      be a band now!"</p>
<p class="docText">At lunchtime in the summer, the World Trade Center often presented
      a band: one day for jazz, one for rock, one for oldies, one for country.
      As a tall woman in a cowboy hat shouldered her electric guitar and
      strolled up to the microphone, I surmised today was country. Sure
      enough, soon she was belting out a rousing, twangy anthem accompanied by
      a bass player, keyboardist, and drummer. In front of the stage a man in
      a turban, an Asian woman, two Latino teenagers, and an elderly white
      couple began to dance. Others followed&mdash;some tentatively, some
      zestfully&mdash;but all happily.</p>
<p class="docText">"I like the music," Natalya said. "I have never heard this kind
      before."</p>
<p class="docText">"Usually I'm more of a jazz person," I said, "but it's really
      catchy."</p>
<p class="docText">"It makes me nervous," Barbara said.</p>
<p class="docText">"Why?" Natalya asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, my people are from North Carolina, and when we heard this
      kind of music we used to cross to the other side of the road as a
      precaution."</p>
<p class="docText">"Why?" Natalya asked again.</p>
<p class="docText">"Because&#8230;" The music got louder. "Oh, I'll explain later."</p>
<p class="docText">The next song was about a woman who gets fed up with her life,
      packs her bags, stuffs them in the trunk of her car, and drives off down
      the open road fearlessly. It was irresistible, and together the three of
      us joined in the dancing.</p>
<p class="docText">After Labor Day, when the back-to-school mood had begun to settle
      in, and the Quogue outsourced resources were productively contributing
      to their teams' projects, and the database reengineering initiative was
      ticking off milestones on their project plan, the Pharaoh chief
      operations officer announced a large-scale simultaneous musical-chairs
      internal move that affected every department except IT. As the company
      expanded, employees had been doubling up inside offices and carving
      workspaces out of every spare nook and cranny. The Facilities manager
      hoped to address this problem by reshuffling everyone into smaller but
      more ergonomic quarters. The Quogue people, who had been scattered at
      random throughout the building, were to be housed inside the old bank
      branch storage space. The IT group was being spared because the
      architect had taken one look at our electricity and cabling requirements
      and pronounced us Not Worth The Trouble, but nonetheless, we realized
      that the chaos among our end users would have a destabilizing effect on
      our project plans.</p>
<p class="docText">At Dave's status meeting immediately following the move, all the
      EDs reported delays and problems on their projects. However, two weeks
      later the situation remained unsatisfactory. The metrics I had gathered
      and developers I had questioned indicated that the Quogue outsourced
      resources were responsible for most of the issues.</p>
<p class="docText">"There has been some disruption," Frank
      agreed cheerfully. "But the new space is much quieter. It has larger
      desks and better chairs. From where I sit I can see everyone and keep
      track of what they are doing. We're going through a period of
      adjustment, and I expect we'll be back on course soon."</p>
<p class="docText">This confident prediction unfortunately proved overly optimistic.
      Deadlines were missed. Defect rates soared. The Quogue people, formerly
      admired for their exemplary attendance records, called in sick much more
      often. Frank stared at his shoes when he walked around the
      hallways.</p>
<p class="docText">Since the initiation of the project, the database reengineering
      status meeting had been held every Wednesday afternoon in our group's
      largest conference room. Representatives from all the upstream and
      downstream application teams summarized their progress and described any
      issues they had encountered. The database developers discussed changes
      they were incorporating in the next version they planned to install on
      the QA server. Testers and project managers also attended the meeting to
      stay informed. As a time commitment, it was long, boring, and
      necessary.</p>
<p class="docText">Six weeks after the big move, during this Wednesday meeting,
      Natalya distributed some documents that were covered with dark smudges.
      As it happened, at the end of the meeting everyone else bolted, and she
      and I were left alone at the conference table while we packed up.</p>
<p class="docText">Casually, I pointed out the smudges on her papers.</p>
<p class="docText">"Does the printer in your new space need maintenance?" I
      asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"No, it is the soot."</p>
<p class="docText">"What soot?"</p>
<p class="docText">She clapped her hand over her mouth and looked horrified. Shaking
      her head, acting disoriented, she started to rise from her chair.</p>
<p class="docText">"Nothing. It is nothing," she said vehemently.</p>
<p class="docText">"No, wait. What soot? What's the matter? Why are you
      upset?"</p>
<p class="docText">To my astonishment she sank back into her seat, covered her face
      with her hands, and began weeping.</p>
<p class="docText">And so the story came out. The ancient HVAC system in the bank
      branch area had not been cleaned before the new office furniture was
      installed. When it was finally turned on, after everyone had moved in,
      decades of accumulated gunk started raining down. Every morning, the
      Quogue people needed to spend at least half an hour cleaning a thick
      layer of soot off their desks, monitors, and chairs. By the end of the
      day, the soot had built up again. Papers had to be kept inside
      drawers.</p>
<p class="docText">"Everyone is coughing," Natalya sobbed. "Vikram's asthma is very
      bad, and Olga has bronchitis."</p>
<p class="docText">"How could Facilities get away with this?" I
      said. "It must be an OSHA violation."</p>
<p class="docText">"What is OSHA?"</p>
<p class="docText">I gave her a brief overview of the Occupational Safety and Health
      Administration, American labor law, and worker protection rights. She
      seemed skeptical.</p>
<p class="docText">"These principles are very nice, but they apply only to citizens,"
      she informed me.</p>
<p class="docText">"That's not true. Where did you get that idea? Look, we can fix
      this. I'll talk to Dave and we'll set up a meeting with
      Facilities."</p>
<p class="docText">"No, no, please don't!" she wailed. "I'll lose my job. I'll have
      to pay back $50,000. We just bought our house&#8230;."</p>
<p class="docText">"Natalya, what are you talking about?" Listening to her fearful
      visions, I wondered whether the nuclear power plant accident had made
      her paranoid.</p>
<p class="docText">But no: it turned out she had good reason to be afraid. She
      explained that the Quogue employment contract was based on a two-year
      "probation." If an employee were terminated during that period, he or
      she would be obliged to repay the entire amount of wages received to
      date. Immigrants also risked the loss of their Green Card sponsor and
      possibly deportation. Frank had forbidden the Quogue people to complain
      about their new workspace, and had made it clear that anyone who did
      would be fired.</p>
<p class="docText">When Natalya finished speaking she leaned back in her chair,
      exhausted. Her eyes were dry and she gazed at me with resignation. Never
      before had I experienced the emotional weight of an adult putting her
      fate in my hands.</p>
<p class="docText">"OK," I said. "I get it. This conversation never happened. But we
      are going to fix the problem."</p>
<p class="docText">I went back to my office, shut the door, and looked for some music
      to help me think. In my pile of CDs I found one I'd bought recently by
      the country music band we had heard on the World Trade Center plaza. To
      the accompaniment of their rousing songs, I called Barbara.</p>
<p class="docText">"Have you ever visited the bank space since Quogue moved in?" I
      asked her.</p>
<p class="docText">"No, their people come to us for meetings. It's always been that
      way, even before the move. Why?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, it occurred to me maybe the reason they've got adjustment
      problems in the new space is that they never had a housewarming
      party."</p>
<p class="docText">She laughed. "I didn't know you were so superstitious."</p>
<p class="docText">"I thought it might be a nice team-building gesture to surprise
      them with some breakfast goodies tomorrow morning. You want to join the
      party?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure, what can I bring?"</p>
<p class="docText">At 8:00 a.m. we arrived outside the locked
      door bearing doughnuts, bagels, croissants, juice, and a camera. I
      punched in the security code, but it no longer worked.</p>
<p class="docText">"That's odd," Barbara said. "Did you get an email about changing
      the code?"</p>
<p class="docText">At that moment, Rafiq came up behind us and let us in. He looked
      pleased to see us at first, then apprehensive.</p>
<p class="docText">We strolled along a short hallway into an open area surrounding a
      copy machine and set our boxes and cartons down on top of a filing
      cabinet.</p>
<p class="docText">"Good morning Quoggies!" I called out. "Breakfast is
      served!"</p>
<p class="docText">Heads popped up above cubicle walls.</p>
<p class="docText">"Holy Mother of God," Barbara gasped. "It's filthy in
      here!"</p>
<p class="docText">The soot was thick enough to write a person's name across the
      desks and cabinets. Rolls of paper towels stood sentry at each cluster
      of cubicles. Many of the Quogue people wore black sweaters and shawls to
      protect their clothes, and hats or scarves on their heads. A fine black
      snow wafted down from the HVAC vents overhead.</p>
<p class="docText">"Looks like some problem with the ventilation," I observed.</p>
<p class="docText">Barbara brushed soot off her yellow silk shirt. "Where's that
      camera?"</p>
<p class="docText">Frank came bounding out of his glass-walled office and tried to
      stand in front of the camera.</p>
<p class="docText">"Ladies! Nice of you to visit. Thanks for the food."</p>
<p class="docText">Barbara stepped around him and began taking pictures. I noticed
      that the vent inside his office was covered with a makeshift cheesecloth
      filter.</p>
<p class="docText">"What does Facilities have to say about this air-quality
      situation?" I asked him.</p>
<p class="docText">"They're working on it. They're looking for a special kind of
      contractor to come in and clean the ducts."</p>
<p class="docText">"Have you spoken to Dave about it?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Yeah, he told me to keep following up with Facilities." He
      shrugged. "I've seen worse."</p>
<p class="docText">"I can imagine."</p>
<p class="docText">The pictures did not do justice to the scene, so Barbara and I
      took it upon ourselves to spread the word. We spoke to every development
      manager and lead developer who had outsourced resources on their team,
      and most of them made the time to visit the Quogue workspace. I put an
      item on the agenda for Dave's next status meeting. I was confident he
      would recognize the urgency of the problem, and I was well prepared for
      the discussion with several alternative suggestions.</p>
<p class="docText">The initial results were disappointing, to say the least.</p>
<p class="docText">"Dave, I believe there is a relationship
      between the air-quality issues in the Quogue workspace and the decline
      in key performance indicators for the engagement," I said when it was my
      turn to speak. "I'd like to recommend that we escalate the&mdash;"</p>
<p class="docText">"What do you think?" Dave asked Frank.</p>
<p class="docText">"I don't really see a connection," Frank said, "although it would
      be nice to get those ducts cleaned."</p>
<p class="docText">"This is a matter for Facilities," Dave told me. "Frank is
      handling it."</p>
<p class="docText">"I understand, and I know he has been diligent, but it
      seems&mdash;"</p>
<p class="docText">Dave raised his finger to cut me off.</p>
<p class="docText">"In the future," he said sternly, "I would like you to remember
      that your quality assurance role is limited to <a name="idx-CHP-29-0909"></a>software."</p>
<p class="docText">I looked around the table for support and encountered a wall of
      blank faces. In my imagination I heard a sickening thump as my career
      hit the rocks.</p>
<p class="docText">After the meeting, I was on my way to the ladies' room to sulk
      when Mark grabbed my arm.</p>
<p class="docText">"Hang in there," he said. "This was only Round One."</p>
<p class="docText">Behind him, Zvi nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="docText">Round Two consisted of a four-pronged under-the-radar publicity
      campaign. Following Barbara's script, the project managers for all
      applications that employed Quogue outsourced resources arranged meetings
      with their business sponsors and described the negative effect the
      environmental problem was having on the development process. Nick, whose
      PM portfolio included the legal systems, was dispatched on a mission to
      review the Quogue contract and to inquire about whether OSHA rules
      covered vendor employees working on Pharaoh property. Carol invited the
      CIO to a birthday party in her group, then lured him away for a glimpse
      of the Quogue workspace. On the pretext of acquiring a Ping-Pong table
      for the fitness center, Mark visited the Facilities manager and
      questioned him about the plan to clean the ducts.</p>
<p class="docText">Dave was not pleased to see the air-quality item on the agenda
      again for his next status meeting. This time it was Mark who had added
      it, so I was out of the line of fire.</p>
<p class="docText">"I'm not sure why we're still talking about this," Frank said.
      "Many of the adjustment issues are being resolved, and the engagement
      metrics have improved."</p>
<p class="docText">He had a point. Relieved that someone was finally paying attention
      to their plight, the Quogue people had recovered some of their earlier
      commitment to Pharaoh projects. Unfortunately, this did not help their
      cause.</p>
<p class="docText">"We're still talking about it because it is a disgrace," Mark
      retorted.</p>
<p class="docText">Dave told Frank that he was excused from the
      meeting. After Frank had gone, he faced Mark angrily.</p>
<p class="docText">"The moral context you're projecting on this situation is out of
      scope," he said. "Facilities has indicated that if we want the ducts
      cleaned we have to pay for it, and it is not in our budget."</p>
<p class="docText">"We should not force anyone to work in such an unhealthy
      environment," Mark said.</p>
<p class="docText">"Who's forcing them?" Paul said. "It's a good steady job. If they
      don't like it they can leave."</p>
<p class="docText">"They can't leave," I said. "They have no choice. They're like
      indentured servants."</p>
<p class="docText">"Everyone has a choice," Paul growled. "We make our choices and we
      live with the consequences."</p>
<p class="docText">"How long is the Quogue contract?" Anupam asked. "If we outsource
      to India instead, we won't have to worry about American laws and
      standards."</p>
<p class="docText">Zvi reached out his hands, palms up. "It was a mistake. The
      architect, the Facilities manager&#8230;they forgot, we forgot&#8230;who knows; it's
      done. It needs to be fixed. Let's get all the parties together and
      figure out a solution, and then we'll see who pays."</p>
<p class="docText">"Zvi is correct." Carol Chu was not smiling. "But the systems
      development budget should not pay. Our CIO should push back."</p>
<p class="docText">"Believe me, our CIO is not going to push back." Dave sighed.
      "Look, we're dealing with contingent labor here. We brought them in to
      reduce costs. It's not like this is a meatpacking plant."</p>
<p class="docText">Being a novice in an ongoing tournament of management politics, I
      assumed we eco-crusaders were checkmated. Carol Chu assured me that the
      game was not over yet. The sooty ducts in the Quogue workspace had
      become hot gossip throughout Pharaoh headquarters. A groundswell of
      popular sympathy for our outsourced resources was causing ripples in
      high places.</p>
<p class="docText">The participants in Round Three were senior executives attending
      an off-site strategic planning meeting: the chief operating officer, the
      chief information officer, and the general counsel. Whether they were
      motivated by a sense of justice or by a fear of contract disputes and
      embarrassing leaks to the media, they decided that the problem was
      serious enough to warrant immediate attention. As soon as they returned
      from their retreat, the COO replaced the Facilities manager and hired a
      contracting firm that specialized in HVAC systems. The general counsel
      opened negotiations with the architect in charge of the renovation over
      liability for the duct cleaning costs. The CIO directed a writer from
      corporate communications to draft an article for the weekly company
      intranet bulletin honoring Dave for his humanistic principles and his
      ability to combine fiscal responsibility with a concern for all his
      workers' health and welfare.</p>
<p class="docText">Quogue Consulting's management expressed its
      displeasure with Frank's behavior during this episode by summoning him
      to their headquarters for several days of interrogation, penance, and
      remedial training.</p>
<p class="docText">During Frank's absence, I got an email from Rafiq requesting that
      I come to the Quogue workspace to look at some test results on his
      computer.</p>
<p class="docText">The former bank branch space was now immaculate. On two
      consecutive weekends, the contractors had scrubbed out the decades'
      accumulation of filth. No soot was falling from the vents. Morning
      sunshine gleamed off surfaces that were as clean as the night before.
      The Quogue people had shed their protective layers of dark
      clothing.</p>
<p class="docText">It turned out that the test results were a ruse, and what awaited
      me was a kind of surprise party. With their boss away, the developers
      and testers had assembled around the copy machine. Rafiq led me over to
      the group. Shyly, Natalya handed me an envelope containing a card. On
      the front it said, "Thank You." On the inside everyone had signed their
      name. Later, when I showed the card to my unimpressed adolescent
      daughter, I tried to explain to her that the most meaningful
      achievements of one's career can't always be articulated on a
      resume.</p>
<p class="docText">And so the sick part of our building was healed. Life went back to
      normal for both Pharaoh employees and Quogue outsourced resources. We
      completed the database reengineering project&mdash;not on time, nor within
      budget, but the business was satisfied with the result, and we felt we
      had laid a solid technological foundation for the future.</p>
<p class="docText">Yet the future for our building and our people was to be anything
      but solid and normal. On September 11, 2001, the terrorist attacks on
      the World Trade Center dropped fragments of airplanes and human bodies
      on our roof and enveloped our neighborhood in a toxic cloud.</p>
<p class="docText">For the next week, all was chaos and confusion, and nobody did
      much work. The following week, we were back in business at an IT
      disaster recovery site across the Hudson River in Jersey City.</p>
<p class="docText">From our conference room window, we could see the burning rubble
      and a corner of our building. Our group was set up in a huge open area,
      like a trading floor but with fewer screens per workstation. None of our
      employees had been killed in the attack, but everyone knew someone who
      had lost someone. Our new Facilities manager, a healthy 43-year-old, had
      died suddenly of a heart attack September 15 while inspecting the damage
      to our building.</p>
<p class="docText">During that time, all of us were not quite sane.</p>
<p class="docText">At Dave's first status meeting, we watched the hellish smoke rise
      from the pit while we discussed absence codes for the PMO's project
      tracking database.</p>
<p class="docText">"Should we code last week as sick days?" Frank asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"I think personal days makes more sense," Carol Chu
      replied.</p>
<p class="docText">"But then they'll be deducted from each
      employee's reserve," Barbara pointed out.</p>
<p class="docText">"The HR system and the timesheet system will be affected," I
      said.</p>
<p class="docText">"Isn't there a category for absences outside your control, like
      snow days?" Zvi proposed.</p>
<p class="docText">"What about overtime?" Paul asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"Speaking of overtime," Mark said, "I want to make sure that
      Natalya gets some recognition for what she's doing."</p>
<p class="docText">"We're <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> doing more than is humanly
      possible," Dave snapped.</p>
<p class="docText">"That's true," Zvi said, "but Natalya is running a hotel. She has
      eight developers sleeping on her floor&mdash;ours and Quogue's."</p>
<p class="docText">"Why?" Frank asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"The developers live downwind in Brooklyn," Mark explained. "Her
      house is on Staten Island. It's upwind of the smoke."</p>
<p class="docText">"We've never tracked overtime," Dave said, "and we're not going to
      start now."</p>
<p class="docText">A roar and a series of loud crashes interrupted our debate. Due to
      our twitchy reflexes, the entire management team around the conference
      table leaped up to investigate. We discovered that in the lounge area a
      man was assaulting a vending machine.</p>
<p class="docText">It was Dominic, a Java developer on the accounts payable system.
      Bald, round-faced, middle-aged, and built like a wrestler, in a frenzy
      of rage he was smashing the machine with a metal folding chair and
      throwing in a few vicious kicks for good measure.</p>
<p class="docText">"<span class="docEmphasis">Give me my fucking money back! I want a candy
      bar</span>!" he howled.</p>
<p class="docText">Mark shook his head sadly.</p>
<p class="docText">"Poor Dominic. His uncle is a firefighter. He told me that since
      last week he's gone to seven funerals."</p>
<p class="docText">The other people who had been in or near the lounge had withdrawn,
      forming a semicircle at a safe distance.</p>
<p class="docText">Dominic wheeled around and glared at them.</p>
<p class="docText">"<span class="docEmphasis">It ate my last dollar bill</span>!"</p>
<p class="docText">The bystanders took a step backward, afraid that he would hurl the
      chair in their direction.</p>
<p class="docText">"I'll call Security," Barbara said.</p>
<p class="docText">"No, don't," said Paul. "He's got enough problems already."</p>
<p class="docText">"Let me see what I can do," Mark said.</p>
<p class="docText">But before Mark could move, Natalya emerged
      from the cluster of people and calmly walked right up to Dominic.</p>
<p class="docText">"<span class="docEmphasis">I'M SO ANGRY</span>!" he shouted at her in a tone
      that made me flinch.</p>
<p class="docText">But not her. She reached out and touched his cheek.</p>
<p class="docText">"Yes," she said. "Of course you're angry. It's not fair."</p>
<p class="docText">It was like popping a blister. Immediately Dominic's fury began to
      evaporate. He put down the chair. After a moment he glanced around and
      seemed startled by the mayhem he had created.</p>
<p class="docText">"Come," she said.</p>
<p class="docText">She led him to the couch in the lounge and sat down next to him,
      putting her arm around his shoulder. He rested his elbows on his knees
      and buried his face in his hands, a picture of devastation.</p>
<p class="docText">That evening I ran into Natalya at the elevator when we were both
      leaving. As we waited, we compared notes about how our kids were coping.
      We agreed that teenagers were unlikely to disclose their feelings to
      their parents and needed careful observation.</p>
<p class="docText">"You know, I've been meaning to ask you something," I said. "How
      does this disaster compare with the Chernobyl accident?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Oh, they are completely different." She smiled ruefully and shook
      her head. "In Chernobyl, the government pretended everything was fine,
      and the news told us nothing. We had no idea what was going on. Here the
      news tells you everything. I am very glad to be living in a country
      where the government does not lie to the people."</p>
<p class="docText">We moved back into our office building at the end of October.
      Pharaoh was one of the first major businesses to resume operations
      within the military security zone. The same contracting firm that had
      cleaned the HVAC ducts in the Quogue work area was hired to do a much
      bigger job of scrubbing, decontaminating, and filtering. Despite the
      acrid odor of burning flesh and other unknown elements that gagged us
      every time we stepped outside, the air in our neighborhood was declared
      safe by the EPA.</p>
<p class="docText">Inevitably, we moved on. A year later, I left Pharaoh to become a
      consultant and teacher. Anupam finally succeeded in convincing senior IT
      management that outsourcing offshore was a good idea. When Quogue
      Consulting's contract expired, an Indian firm took over their projects
      and moved the jobs to Bangalore. The engagement grew rapidly, and this
      time there were many layoffs among Pharaoh employees.</p>
<p class="docText">Most of my former colleagues continued their careers in publishing
      and financial services IT. Scott moved to Australia and started a
      business organizing scuba diving trips to the Great Barrier Reef. After
      his divorce, Dave took a very senior job at a major consulting company
      advising its clients on how to cut costs by moving work offshore.</p>
<p class="docText">Barbara became the PMO director at a company
      that designs and manufactures several high-end brands of
      clothing.</p>
<p class="docText">Our office building no longer exists. Having survived terrorism,
      it fell victim to the Manhattan real estate market. It has been
      demolished, and in its place are now luxury condos.</p>
<p class="docText">The one person I'm sorry to have lost touch with is Natalya. I
      think of her often, especially when the curriculum in the business
      school classes I teach focuses on teamwork. I hope one day some social
      networking website will help us reconnect. I want to know how she and
      her family are doing. I'd also like to ask her that elevator question
      again and find out whether she still has the same faith.</p>
