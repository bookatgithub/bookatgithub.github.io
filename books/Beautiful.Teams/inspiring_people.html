<p class="docText">Keoki Andrus is an expert on improving the way teams work
        together. We first heard of him from a talk that he gave on
        performance and potential when he was head of operations at Intuit. He
        has some great ideas about how to take somewhat lofty concepts like
        "vision" and "potential" and turn them into practical, real-world
        techniques for improving the way teams run. Andrew sat down with Keoki
        to talk about this.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, how did you come to know
      about software teams?</span><a name="idx-CHP-6-0106"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: Well, I've been in the
      software industry for 20 years. I started at Microsoft, and I worked on
      the first versions of Word. I worked with one of the project managers
      for Office, too, when we converted it from a bundle to a suite. After
      that, I worked as an executive for years, running product management at
      Novell in project management and strategy.</p>
<p class="docText">This became a family joke with my wife. We would always start the
      engagement with a discussion of "What should we be doing with our
      product?" And almost always, within a few days, it became a discussion
      of "How do I run my company? My <a name="idx-CHP-6-0107"></a>people aren't happy. How do we solve these problems?" And
      it's always because of the way the organization runs, and the
      cohesiveness of the organization&mdash;those things have a huge impact on the
      success.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Where did you really cut your teeth on getting
      teams working?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: I worked at Intuit for a
      while. I ran a company, and I was called in there. The Orem, Utah, site
      was a site that they had opened up six years previously, and it was
      really failing. When I talked to Intuit, they had kind of made up their
      minds that they were going to shut it down, they just didn't have the
      productivity. "Morale is low, and if we don't get it turned around we're
      gonna have to close it. So, you're our last chance. Why don't you give
      it a try?" Well, I worked with that site and we turned it around from a
      low-morale, low-productivity kind of a scattered organization into one
      of the best performing group of engineers in the company. We doubled the
      size of the site. Some people got promoted, some people had to leave,
      but it ended up being pretty successful.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That's pretty impressive. How did you do
      it?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: The first thing I did
      was that I went and just sat down with each individual in the site and
      tried to get a pulse from them&mdash;what they saw as some of the
      difficulties.</p>
<p class="docText">I had two objectives in doing that. The first objective was that I
      really did want to understand them, and what was going on from their
      perspective. The second thing I wanted to do was help them to understand
      that I truly cared. Because my doming hypothesis is that if people don't
      believe you care, they're not going to care about what you say.</p>
<p class="docText">I discovered pretty quickly that there was a lot of discontent.
      The team had several individuals who had very high potential and could
      really become high performers, but they were fractured. These people had
      a strong need for human connection, for good working relationships, but
      they had been peeled off one by one to work on projects as part of a
      remote team.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, some people can do that very well. But for people who need a
      day-to-day high degree of interpersonal connectivity with others that
      they're working with, that doesn't work so well. I noticed these people;
      they were leaders at the site and they were well respected, but they
      were grumpasaurs.</p>
<p class="docText">First I tried to tell them, "You've got to
      knock that off," but they just couldn't hear that message. Then I
      noticed that one of the managers at the site that I was managing was
      well respected by everybody. In fact, I would go beyond well respected.
      I would say he was loved by everybody.</p>
<p class="docText">And I grew to feel the same way, and I still think of him
      extremely highly. He's one of those fantastic human beings of high
      integrity, but he was getting the crud kicked out of him by upper
      <a name="idx-CHP-6-0108"></a>management because of the way his <a name="idx-CHP-6-0109"></a>people were acting. So, I pulled aside the leader among
      all the high-potential low performers and I said, "Here's the deal. You
      can be a superstar, but you're frustrated by some of the things going
      on." He agreed. So I said, "Did you know that your actions are hurting
      your manager?"</p>
<p class="docText">That stunned him, because he loved this guy and he didn't want to
      hurt him. So I sat down with him and I kind of went through his career
      possibilities and who he was.</p>
<p class="docText">By this point, he knew I really cared about him, because I hadn't
      pistol-whipped him even though he'd been pretty open about some things
      he wasn't happy with.</p>
<p class="docText">So, I went to his remote managers, and I worked out a transition
      plan for him to get back on a local team. They were happy to get rid of
      him, because he was so unhappy. So he saw that coming. He could see that
      I was going to bat for him, and once we got to that point, I sat down
      with him and I went point by point through each of the strengths that I
      saw that he had.</p>
<p class="docText">I said, "You know, when you add all these up, you are destined to
      be a superstar, but this need to be a curmudgeon, to be disruptive in
      this negative way, is killing you. Could we just throttle that back a
      bit? I know it's you, to be able to say these things that other people
      don't say. You're funny and you love to show that off. But could you
      just kind of keep that around here with the boys? Could we just not do
      that when we're on the phone with people at corporate?" And he turned
      around!</p>
<p class="docText">Then there was the manager. I had to help him to start to see how
      he could manage his people. I'd been told by the vice president about
      that manager, "You're probably going to have to let this guy go. He's
      got a lot of potential, but right now he's just dead wood, and we can't
      figure out a way to get him to work successfully."</p>
<p class="docText">So, I went and met the guy, and I went through his life with him.
      Then I talked to the VP and said, "You know what, this guy is a
      superstar. He's not marketing very well, but he's a superstar. He's just
      got a few adjustments to the way he interacts with others that he's got
      to change." So I talked to him just like I talked to the developer.
      Basically, I said, "Here's why you're great, here's the stuff that's
      holding you back. Let's work together on not advertising that one thing
      so much, and we'll shore up a couple of these areas and get you where
      you need to be."</p>
<p class="docText">He started working on that. Six months later, the site was really
      moving forward.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds like you started
      with a good team that had all of the right technical skills, but were
      being held back by that "soft" stuff that software people like us hate
      to think about. And it sounds like you approached the problem by
      knocking down communication barriers&mdash;helping them talk to other people
      better, advertise their strong points, tone down their weaker points in
      front of outside people. Is that how you operate? Starting with
      communication issues?</span><a name="idx-CHP-6-0110"></a><a name="idx-CHP-6-0111"></a><a name="idx-CHP-6-0112"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: I'm a one-on-one
      communicator, and I love to be with somebody face to face. I don't do as
      well on the phone. With that manager, it was actually kind of funny,
      because at first the vice president basically said, "Why haven't you
      fired him? This guy's a loser. You need to get a new manager in there."
      I had to tell him, "You know, I really think he's got some great
      qualities and great capabilities and we need to invest in bringing those
      out." That vice president actually told me, "You're the first person in
      six years to ever say anything positive about this guy to me. Are you
      sure?"</p>
<p class="docText">Later that year, I got my review, and my review was really good.
      But part of the review said, "It's so amazing how much you've managed to
      accomplish, seeing that you have to work with people like this guy and
      others who aren't very talented." I found that offensive, because I
      thought these guys were amazing.</p>
<p class="docText">So, every time they did something good, I made sure it was
      genuinely good. It wasn't just marketing. These people were really
      genuinely good, but nobody knew. So I started making sure that proper
      credit was given to them when they did something good. And after a while
      people started talking about that same manager and saying, "He's
      phenomenal."</p>
<p class="docText">And then the next year, a funny thing happened. I got my review&mdash;it
      cracks me up, because my review said, "Yes, your site was fantastic. But
      what do you expect, when you have an amazing manager like this running
      the place for you?" I sure wasn't going to say anything, right? Because
      that was what I was trying to do for him. But I thought that was
      hilarious.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, what did you learn from all of that? Is
      there some core principle that you took away from all of
      it?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: One thing that I
      realized was that, going back to the beginning, these people had no
      <a name="idx-CHP-6-0113"></a>vision. They just saw themselves as working at a job.
      Nobody sees their own greatness or their own potential. So I sprang some
      visions.</p>
<p class="docText">The first vision was that this would be the greatest engineering
      group in the company: that people would look to us as the vanguards, the
      trendsetters, the ones who were always on the edge of doing the
      greatest, most innovative things. We would be the group that you go to
      when you have a hard task.</p>
<p class="docText">Up until now, they were the street cleaners, the garbage men.
      "Somebody's got to code this. We'll throw it over to them." And I
      thought, "We've got to change that." And one of the things that I
      observed was that every engineer there really was talented. They were
      really talented, but the problem was that each one of them had their own
      method for software development.</p>
<p class="docText">They all had their own way of doing things,
      writing code. They all were good at it, and they all understood each
      other's methods well enough to get along with each other and adjust on
      the fly. But if anybody new came into the group, they couldn't
      comprehend it. So the organization had no ability whatsoever to
      scale.</p>
<p class="docText">If you were an old-timer, great. If not, you can't swim with these
      guys. And from an outsider's perspective, if you're working with them
      you can't even talk the same language as them, even though you're a
      software guy. So, I brought in a group on software <a name="idx-CHP-6-0114"></a>process, and we implemented a very hardcore process, which
      everybody whined at me about.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I've been there, gone down the same process
      road. You must have run into some resistance from the team, because they
      didn't want to change the way they built the software</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: They were all saying
      things like, "This is terrible, it's so hard." I said, "You know what,
      guys? We're about scaling. We are about creating an organization that
      delivers super-high quality on time, and you guys are capable of doing
      it. I know this is miserable." I knew that these guys would want to
      monkey around, and that they'd rebel. I also knew that no process fits
      everything, and that there's always some part of a process that's
      stupid.</p>
<p class="docText">And I have a philosophy that I live by. Everybody that works with
      me knows this; it's on the wall: "If stupid enters the room, you have a
      moral duty to shoot it, no matter who's escorting it."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Did people take that idea seriously? Even if it
      was your idea that they thought was stupid?</span><a name="idx-CHP-6-0115"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: People who work with me
      know that. If I'm escorting it, shoot it. I don't have any problem with
      that whatsoever. I will laugh if you point out how dumb I am. There's no
      ego with that.</p>
<p class="docText">What I wanted to do was get them to just give the new way of doing
      things a try, because everybody had this resistance of change. I was
      hard-nosed at the beginning: "We will do everything in the process, no
      matter how stupid it seems." The response was "Ugh." But at this point,
      they trusted me some, because the site was now getting creditability,
      good things were happening, they were getting treated well, they were
      enjoying their work, and they were sitting there going, "Well, Keoki's
      done these other things. Maybe this is OK, too, but it seems
      stupid."</p>
<p class="docText">So, they trusted me enough to do it. I said, "Guys, just hang on.
      Run with it for a while, and then when we find the stupid, and when
      we're sure that it's stupid and don't just think that it's going to be
      stupid, we'll change it." I got them to run with it for a few months.
      There were a couple parts of it where they said, "I don't get it" or "I
      know MIT came up with this, but it's dumb."</p>
<p class="docText">I'd say, "Well, let's talk about why it's dumb. Is it dumb because
      you just don't like it, or is it dumb because it doesn't fit our
      circumstances? If you can explain to me why it doesn't fit
      our system, our particular circumstances, then we'll change it." We
      implemented a few changes, which actually helped the
      organization.</p>
<p class="docText">We got better at the process. At the same time, they realized I
      live by my philosophy, that I wasn't going to make them do stupid things
      just because that was the way it is. We got through that phase, and then
      we started delivering.</p>
<p class="docText">Compared to everybody, the other development organization, we were
      on time. And our quality was insanely high; it was like a couple of
      quantum levels above everybody else's.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That's a pretty impressive result. But it
      strikes me that you didn't do anything magical&mdash;a lot of it sounds like
      common sense. You mentioned that you had sprung several visions. What
      did you do next?</span><a name="idx-CHP-6-0116"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: The next part of the
      vision was, "Well, we have to be the greatest." Well, what do the great
      engineers do? They innovate. So, we launched a program of trying to
      really think outside the box, to figure out how do we innovate.</p>
<p class="docText">We started creating patents. In the first year that we started
      this program, where we really put emphasis on innovating to create new
      intellectual property, we only represented one-half of one percent of
      all the engineers at the company, and we innovated like seven or eight
      percent&mdash;we had seven or eight percent of all the patents.</p>
<p class="docText">In the next year, we had 16 or 17 percent of all the patents in
      the company.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That's a huge jump. What did you do? Mandatory
      weekly brainstorming sessions?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: One way I accomplished
      that was I did very little screening on <a name="idx-CHP-6-0117"></a>people-submitted ideas. I wanted the ideas, I wanted them
      to flow, not to criticize. Then, later, we'd let the screening people at
      the company screen out some ideas, and say these are the ones we're
      interested in.</p>
<p class="docText">And it was funny, because I got an email once from legal, and they
      said, "You know, we need to talk about what appropriate patent idea
      submissions are and which ones are or aren't appropriate." And then
      somebody got a hold of them and said, "Shut up! He's the only guy doing
      what we actually want him to do." And I got a nice, polite little email:
      "Never mind, we don't need to talk about that."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I still want to know how you got that level of
      innovation, because sometimes innovation seems, well, almost mysterious
      to me. Where do ideas come from? I know we want to talk about teams, but
      it seems to me that those two things aren't unrelated. How do you get a
      team of people to come up with good ideas? How do you improve, how do
      you help people innovate in groups?</span><a name="idx-CHP-6-0118"></a><a name="idx-CHP-6-0119"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: There's a general
      process of leadership which is key to all of us. The first thing is to
      establish a vision that everybody believes in passionately, and that's a
      process of inclusion and ownership. Then the second thing is the how. If
      people own the vision, they will internally create passion that creates
      the innovative juices.</p>
<p class="docText">When we discuss these things within the team,
      I don't come up with all my own ideas. I socialize them into the group.
      We negotiate until we get to the point where everybody's passionate. I
      brought up this thing with the patents with them, and they got turned on
      about it, because it was part of our vision for being great and putting
      our site on the map.</p>
<p class="docText">Once that happened, then whenever we'd be in meetings, somebody
      would have an idea, someone would always ask the question, "Is that
      patentable?" And <a name="idx-CHP-6-0120"></a>people would start talking about it: "Wait a minute; that
      could be patentable." After a while, I would go around the office&mdash;one
      guy had on his whiteboard a big thing just listing all the ideas that
      were active in the group.</p>
<p class="docText">It became part of the culture to figure out how we could innovate.
      People got excited because there was always a question: "Is that
      patentable?" and you've got to follow up on that. It was all part of the
      vision, how the team saw themselves. If you set a vision, you've got to
      follow up on what's important, and when people see it, if they have that
      personal passion, they really will create spontaneously.</p>
<p class="docText">The other thing is that I had to create some urgency. For example,
      there was this one engineer, a really brilliant database guy, and he
      never wanted to overstate what he can do. Like many engineers, he said,
      "I don't want to promise what I can't deliver." It took me over a year
      for these guys to realize that I would not chew them up for being bold,
      for learning something new that changed their schedule.</p>
<p class="docText">Man, be bold. That's a rule. If we learn something new, well,
      we're smart guys. We know that we learned something new, and that
      changes what we thought. Only imbeciles chew people out for not having
      known everything that they would yet learn.</p>
<p class="docText">Yet, engineers always get punished, because everybody wants a
      schedule from them. Well, I don't play that game. These people started
      to get that. This engineer, he never wanted to promise what he couldn't
      deliver. When I realized that, I figured, "I got his number."</p>
<p class="docText">He'd come into my office and he would say, "You know, we can't
      solve this problem. It can't be done." And I would look at him and I
      would say, "Jeff, you are one of the most brilliant engineers I've ever
      known in my life. I just have a real hard time hearing the words 'it
      can't be done' coming out of the mouth of one of the most brilliant
      engineers of all time.</p>
<p class="docText">"Tell you what, Jeff, you go back to your cube, and you figure it
      out, and at three o'clock, you come back and tell me what the answer
      is." He'd just look at me and say, "I just told you it's
      impossible."</p>
<p class="docText">"I know, for any normal engineer, it would be impossible, but
      you're not a normal engineer. You are one of the best." Now, you can't
      do this sort of thing if you're not sincere. If you don't have a close,
      intimate relationship with people, where they know you really mean it,
      then they can tell it's all bull.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: But you had that sort of
      relationship with this engineer, so he trusted you and believed you when
      you told him that, right?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>:<a name="idx-CHP-6-0121"></a> Right. He knew I respected him. I've done this so many
      times with him, and it's only him, right, because you've got to know
      every person individually. He'd say, "Oh, I hate it when you do this to
      me."</p>
<p class="docText">Every single time, within two hours either he'd burst <a name="idx-CHP-6-0122"></a>into my office going, "I got it!" or I'd walk by his
      cubicle and he'd say, "Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here!"
      Because he had that brilliance, and I just had to put him in a position
      where he was challenged, where he felt personally motivated to tap into
      it.</p>
<p class="docText">It worked because he knew I wouldn't chew him out. Because I'd
      say, "If you can't figure it out by that time, then nobody can, but I
      think you can." And he never wanted to let me down.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds like you started with a real solid
      group of engineers. You had some top-level talent, a team that had the
      potential to do really good work that was just held back by personality,
      communication, and vision problems. And it sounds like one important way
      you got it all to work was that you figured out what makes each person
      tick, and you gave him exactly that</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: I had another engineer&mdash;I
      hope to get to work with him again. He's a god. He finishes his work
      ahead of schedule with great quality, then goes around the rest of the
      team and helps them solve their problems, and then he goes outside the
      team and fixes everybody else's problems.</p>
<p class="docText">This guy, his thing is play. He will not turn on unless he's in
      the state of play. He loved to play foosball and other games. Now, some
      <a name="idx-CHP-6-0123"></a>people say, "Well, you're not working, you're not doing a
      good job." I say "bull." You have to tap into what turns on the
      creativity for the person so that they are operating in a state of
      passion.</p>
<p class="docText">Man, he loved to play foosball. And we had a thing in the group.
      There's two guys on each side on foosball. So if someone needed a game,
      they'd walk out and you yell, "Three," indicating that number four's
      already been taken. Somebody else yells, "Two," meaning we need two
      more, and then somebody else yells, "One," and then some gal says, "I'm
      in!" and we've got all four now.</p>
<p class="docText">You'd go play a game, and then you go back to your desk. Well,
      some people would say that's stupid. "You're encouraging people not to
      work!" But I detected that for many people, if you took 10 minutes and
      went and played a game, they would go back to their desk with this kind
      of creative, passionate energy from the competition and solve
      problems.</p>
<p class="docText">So I sat down with Jason, that brilliant engineer, one day, and I
      said, "Jason, tell me about how your mind works. You play games all day
      long, but you're the most productive engineer I've ever encountered in
      my career. What is the connection between play and performing at this
      super-high level?"</p>
<p class="docText">And he said, "It's just what I need to clear
      my mind. I get these problems, and if I play for a little bit, I go back
      and I can solve them." And I said, "Jason, here's the deal. I don't know
      if I'll say this for everybody, but if you ever feel the need to play, I
      want you to play, because if that's what it takes to get this kind of
      amazing performance, you should play as much as you need to."</p>
<p class="docText">And he never let me down. So, that was part of your answer to how
      do you get that creativity going. You have to find what turns on passion
      for each individual and then bring them in as a leader into that state
      of play.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: You keep using, it really strikes me, you keep
      using words like </span> respect, passion, creativity,
      <span class="docEmphasis">even</span> love. <span class="docEmphasis">Plenty of people talk about
      respect and creativity when they talk about motivation, but I rarely
      hear people talk about motivation in the language of emotion. But it
      sounds like you use respect and love as management tools, the way
      engineers use engineering terms. They're almost like jargon&mdash;in the
      positive sense of the word </span> jargon. <span class="docEmphasis">When you use
      the word <span class="docEmphasis">love</span>, you're not using it in the
      wishy-washy Hallmark sort of way. It really has a technical meaning, and
      it turns into an important tool to help a team gel. How did you get to
      that point?</span><a name="idx-CHP-6-0124"></a><a name="idx-CHP-6-0125"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: So first of all, I
      discovered early in my career, I'm good at observing. Engineers like to
      think of themselves more like Spock than anybody else. "I am logical.
      That is all I do."</p>
<p class="docText">So, I started observing how engineers would respond when somebody
      criticized their code. And sometimes I'd actually think, "I got a
      2-year-old here. This person is incredibly emotional." The more I
      watched engineers, the more I realized they were as emotional&mdash;if not
      more emotional&mdash;than everybody else, and that emotion was a big part of
      their craft. They just got really good at kind of structuring the way
      they communicated.</p>
<p class="docText">I realized that they need an emotional outlet and connections,
      just like everybody else. So that was the first thing I figured
      out.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I'm wondering if this ties back to something
      else you mentioned that I wanted to ask more about: when you're coming
      up with ideas, having an overarching vision. You seem to use vision to
      improve performance in a real, measurable way to improve engineering, in
      a way that people who would otherwise not be inclined to use that term
      can respect</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-6-0126"></a><a name="idx-CHP-6-0127"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">And it strikes me that the word "vision" is another one
      of those words that hardcore engineers and developers might not use. It
      probably sounds like business-speak, management-ese jargon. Might not&mdash;I
      know I haven't gotten it in the past</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Personally, it took me a long time to get any traction
      with the concept of a vision for a project, or for a team. I know that
      vision has a lot to do with figuring out who you're building the project
      for, with really meeting their needs, and with understanding what
      problem it is that you're solving. But just hearing you talk about it,
      I'm wondering if maybe there's a more visceral definition for vision.
      Can you help me understand the idea behind vision,
      something that might help somebody who's looking to really come up with
      better ideas, or to improve the way their projects are
      run?</span><a name="idx-CHP-6-0128"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: Sure, I can address
      that. <a name="idx-CHP-6-0129"></a>Vision is typically botched.</p>
<p class="docText">And the way it's botched is like this: "Our vision is to become
      the number one provider of telecommunications equipment in the market."
      Or: "Our vision is that we're not building buggy whips anymore, we're
      building horse motivation tools." We come up with visions that are
      sterile.</p>
<p class="docText">If you want <a name="idx-CHP-6-0130"></a>people to act with power, you have to tap into their
      <a name="idx-CHP-6-0131"></a>emotions. Emotion is where <a name="idx-CHP-6-0132"></a>creativity comes from. It's the source of innovation, and
      of long working hours, and all the other things that you want out of
      people. It doesn't come from holding a gun to their heads. And boring
      doesn't work. So, how do you get a vision that evokes that?</p>
<p class="docText">If the people on the team can't see it in their minds, it's not a
      good vision. So you have to be a little bit of a televangelist in the
      way you paint the picture of the vision.</p>
<p class="docText">Let me give you an example of a vision I had. And I think you
      should have vision all the time. So, my sons have been in show choirs.
      Do you know what show choirs are?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: No</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: Show choirs are kind of
      like Broadway for high school. And these choirs sing, and at the same
      time, they dance&mdash;they do almost drill team at the same time. It's quite
      amazing. My second son is a national champion, and my first son was
      picked as the best male performer. We were going to go on this trip to
      Branson, Missouri, with his group.</p>
<p class="docText">I live in Utah, and it's a 30-hour bus ride. We could do a plane,
      but people wanted to go as cheap as we could. And they went to the
      adults and they said, "We need some parents to volunteer to sit on the
      bus with these teenagers for 30 hours each direction." And parents
      signed up, but everybody had this attitude of like, "Well, we have to do
      it. I'll be swimming in a stew of fatigue, estrogen, and testosterone
      for 30 hours. Oh, it's gonna be awful."</p>
<p class="docText">And I thought about this and I said, "I'm going on this thing.
      What am I going to do? Am I going to just sit for 30 hours each
      direction and then just be miserable that I'm stuck with a bunch of
      teenagers? No, I need a vision." OK, well, what kind of vision could go
      along with this?</p>
<p class="docText">And I started thinking about it, and I said, "Wait a minute, these
      kids are going out and doing something that's one of the great
      opportunities in their young lives: to discover their potential. So wait
      a minute. I'm a guy who's totally into leadership and helping people
      discover their potential. Is there anything I could do?"</p>
<p class="docText">I thought, these kids don't know how to do any of that. What if I
      made it my goal to make this one of the crowning moments of at least
      some of their lives? It could be that thing that they looked back upon
      and think, "That was the time that I really felt my potential. That I
      really touched greatness for a moment."</p>
<p class="docText">That changed my job for the trip: it wasn't to
      babysit these kids for 30 hours each direction and while they're at the
      hotel. My job was to find every moment I can to show them a little way
      to tap into their own greatness. That was what the <a name="idx-CHP-6-0133"></a>vision was for.</p>
<p class="docText">And as a result, just having that <a name="idx-CHP-6-0134"></a>vision and looking for it every moment of that trip&mdash;well,
      first of all, the bus rides were a breeze for me. But second of all, I
      was able to take leaders aside, one by one, when I could see that they
      were at a moment where they didn't know what to do, and show them a
      little bit about greatness. And as a result, they actually accomplished
      amazing things, and it was a great experience in their lives. I'm still
      friends with those same teenagers.</p>
<p class="docText">I shared that with you just to kind of give you the picture of how
      simple a vision can be, and how mundane it can be. What I mean is, it
      can be associated with something so mundane, but I hope that the way I
      told it to you gave you that visceral feeling, where you thought, "Wow,
      I wish I was on that bus with those kids." And that's what a great
      vision does. It makes you feel like, "I want to be part of that." Even
      something as boring as being on a bus for 30 hours with
      adolescents.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I've definitely heard about projects and
      thought, "Man, I wish I could have been on that team." It's probably
      because they had a good vision. I saw an interview once with some video
      game developers from one of my favorite video games, and I thought
      that</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">You know, one of the things that I've written about, and
      something that I've read many times from other people, is when you start
      on a project, you want to get it started out right. You want to avoid
      problems down the road. And everyone&mdash;including Jenny and me, in our own
      books&mdash;says that one thing you really need to do is lay out the vision in
      the beginning of the project. But I never really had a good litmus test
      to be able to tell you that a particular vision is good. And maybe
      you've just given us the answer. A good litmus test of whether you have
      a good vision may be that just hearing it makes you want to be a part of
      the project</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-6-0135"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: Exactly. And the same
      thing works on teams when you're recruiting. I always get the people I
      recruit, because when I recruit them, I don't do the boring song of
      "Here's what your duties will be." On my team, everybody is on their way
      to somewhere in their career, and it's unique for each person. I talk to
      them about that.</p>
<p class="docText">My goal as a leader is to find where that right place is for them,
      that they agree with, and craft a vision of where they're going. Then,
      my job is to help them get there in the context of them doing good work
      for the team. I'll teach them leadership. I'll teach them anything that
      they want to learn so that they can go where they want to be.</p>
<p class="docText">I'll give my recruits examples of how I do that with people, and
      then I say, "Now go talk to the members of my team. And you can ask them
      anything you want. Ask any member of my team." I'll let them talk to
      people already on my team, and they'll say, "Yeah, he's completely
      dedicated not to just my career, but to me as a person."</p>
<p class="docText">They always come back and say, "I've never encountered a job like
      that, and I would give anything to be in a team like that." And so, I
      always win.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Wow, I've done a lot of
      hiring over the years, and I've never done anything like that. Let's say
      I want that for my team, I want that for my company. I want my teams to
      work that way. I can see what it will look like in the end, but how do I
      get there? What's my first step in getting from where I am now? You told
      a story of how you started with a team that had a lot of potential, and
      you turned them around. Let's say I've got a team, and I know they have
      a lot of potential. How do I turn them around? How do I get them from
      point A to point B?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: OK, so one thing is you
      can call me up, and I'll come out and help them. I do this for a living,
      you know.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: (Laughter.)</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: But I do love doing
      this. The process of developing skills is a process of first recognizing
      that you need the skill, then learning the skill, and then processing
      it. Then, to actually get to a master, you need the tutorage of a
      master.</p>
<p class="docText">And you can add that as much as you can in the book, but you
      really do need coaching to become great at something. Now, having said
      that, here's the good news. <a name="idx-CHP-6-0136"></a>People are hungry to actually be cared <a name="idx-CHP-6-0137"></a>about. Think about that for a minute. You want to be
      understood, right? Everybody does. Everybody wants to feel important.
      It's universal.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, if you just try to do this by turning to your team and
      saying, "Oh, yes, I will do this now. I don't feel anything, but I'm
      going to do it," then forget it, you're just a pointy-haired
      boss.</p>
<p class="docText">But if you sincerely just reach out and start with trying to get
      to know your people as human beings, with the mindset of trying to
      understand who they are and what's important to them, trying to be a
      facilitator of their vision or helping them to create a vision, people
      will respond exponentially to being treated with care and compassion,
      because they've been dying for it.</p>
<p class="docText">They're starving to death. Imagine the old clich&eacute; of the man who's
      dying of thirst in the desert. How much will he pay for a drink of
      water? Well, people are starving to death in virtually every job,
      looking to actually be treated like a human being.</p>
<p class="docText">I've never encountered anybody, except people with borderline
      personality disorder, who don't want to be understood. Some people will
      say they don't, but just watch their behavior and you'll realize they
      do.</p>
<p class="docText">And that's what I have found as a leader that I often do with
      people is just sit down and go, "Oh, you know what, you missed it. Let's
      talk about how to succeed with it." And I know that that wasn't the
      greatest answer, but you can't magically jump to it, but you can have
      great results just by trying.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So how does that work in practice? If I were
      bringing you on board, say, to help me improve the way I ran my own
      team? Right now our team is me and Jenny&mdash;we're working on a book
      called</span> Beautiful Teams. <span class="docEmphasis">We're leading a team of
      about three dozen people who are experts at building software, and we're
      all working toward this one goal of writing a book
      that's both informative and interesting. What's the first thing you'd do
      for us?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: I'd ask you to tell me
      more about yourself, you and Jenny. I feel like I hardly know much about
      you. So tell me&mdash;right now.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Right now?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: Sure. What do you do?
      What's your vision? Who are you?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: OK. Well, basically, Jenny and I started writing
      books for O'Reilly a few years ago. We had a lot of fun writing two
      books in their Head First series, writing one on project management and
      one on learning C#</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Before that, we wrote our book on software engineering
      and project management. To be honest, it's really a book on quality, on
      making software better and software projects run better&mdash;we kind of
      realized at the time that our goal was to make the world a little bit
      better by helping people build better software. And that's really what
      we do: we help people build better software. It's why we write books and
      speak at conferences, and it's why we've done so much consulting over
      the years</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-6-0138"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">That's actually why we've spent so much of our careers
      targeting project managers. One thing we figured out early on was that
      project managers are an underused, under-respected resource that can
      really help build better software. If a project manager takes the time
      to understand how software is built, he can do amazing things for his
      team. So I guess that's our vision: we want to give people the tools
      they need to build better software, or maybe to help them solve the
      problems that are keeping them from building better
      software</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">And other than that, I've spent a lot of my life first
      building software and then leading teams that build software. Jenny
      spent a lot of her life first testing software and then leading and
      managing teams that build software. I don't use the word brilliant all
      that often, but she's a brilliant quality engineer. Before I met her, I
      felt that software testing was a kind of "black art," something you're
      kind of born with, or maybe just feel your way through. It wasn't until
      I worked with Jenny, back in the '90s, that I realized that software
      testing is a real engineering discipline in its own right. You can
      understand it, you can make it transparent, and you can get a team to do
      it. And she does it brilliantly. I'd deliver software to her that I
      thought was done, and she'd find so many bugs that I couldn't believe I
      was willing to let it out the door. But more than that, working together
      we figured out how to keep a lot of those bugs from getting into the
      software in the first place. Doing that really made me really realize
      the art of quality, of building better software, as well as the
      science</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: There's a certain way
      that that type of QA person thinks and what motivates them, and if you
      got it, you got it. I was a QA engineer at Microsoft when I started out,
      and I've known some of the people I think like you're describing.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Jenny was the first real QA engineer I met who
      really understood quality, really got it on a deep level. Not just on a
      "let's make this software not crash" level, but really understanding
      it's about how software works, how software meets the users' needs.
      It's about software conforming to
      requirements&mdash;getting back to the real definition of quality. And that's
      what motivates her&mdash;it's what motivates me, too</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Quality's also about process&mdash;but process is more than
      just getting people to do things in a certain, repeatable way. It's more
      than that. It's about changing the way an organization breathes and
      grows, it's about changing the way people actually act and, hopefully,
      how they think about their jobs</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-6-0139"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">We were working together for a few years at a small
      financial software company and, through a lot of trial and error, we
      were lucky enough to be working at a company that was small enough and
      inexperienced enough to let two relatively young, inexperienced people
      change&mdash;completely change&mdash;the way they build software</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">And we got some really good results. We also made a lot
      of mistakes along the way. And it was really good for both of us. I kind
      of feel really privileged to have been able to make such mistakes. And
      we dedicated a lot of our career to understanding mistakes,
      understanding why projects fail</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-6-0140"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: I actually have my top
      10 list of how you create passion, and one of the biggest ones is
      <a name="idx-CHP-6-0141"></a>celebrating mistakes.</p>
<p class="docText">The one talent that virtually every person in the world feels like
      they have that is unique to them and they feel a moral obligation to
      share is the talent of <a name="idx-CHP-6-0142"></a>criticism. "<span class="docEmphasis">I</span> am the one who can find
      what's wrong with this, and since I can, I must tell you what's bad. I
      feel obligated." And we're all conditioned: we all hate it, right, but
      we all are good at it.</p>
<p class="docText">But the thing is, have you ever been in a situation where you've
      been, say, in a meeting, and something bad has happened? Now, that may
      mean anything. Say we shipped the software, and there's a crashing bug
      in it, and it's terrible.</p>
<p class="docText">We're sitting around talking about it, and somebody says, "We need
      to have a postmortem on this so we can figure out what happened." And
      then these words come out: "So that it never happens again." Have you
      ever heard that?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Yes, of course. Most of us
      have</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: OK, let me ask you this
      question then. Can any <a name="idx-CHP-6-0143"></a>success happen in the absence of risk?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That's a good question. Probably not, I
      suppose</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: You will get a zero rate
      of return if you have zero risk, because there's no risk, so why should
      you be compensated? No success ever happened without the presence of
      risk. But what is risk? Risk is the chance that something bad will
      happen. Do you buy that?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Absolutely</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: OK, so if no success can
      happen without risk, and risk means that something bad can happen, then
      if you set out to make an environment where risk goes to zero, what else
      are you driving to zero? The probability of success.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I never thought about it
      that way, but it does follow</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keoki</span>: So it isn't bad to say,
      "You know, we may not have assessed our risk correctly, and we may have
      exercised poor judgment in something we did. Let's see if we can learn
      what we might have screwed up on so that we can be more informed in the
      future."</p>
<p class="docText">But the next thing that happens is that once you figure out what
      went wrong, you go after the person who made the mistake. And everybody
      else sees it; the head rolls down the hallway and gets put on the city
      gates. Everybody learns, "Don't make a mistake." And it's in the very
      act of creating that stress, that stress of not making a mistake, that
      you create the situation where nobody will take a risk.</p>
<p class="docText">Instead, what you must do to create that passion environment is
      when a mistake is made, you say, "OK, what was the mistake? OK, well, we
      did that. Good job. Now we know not to do that. Now we are going to be
      more sensitive to that in the future." You can even give the person a
      reward.</p>
<p class="docText">Now what happens? It creates an environment where people don't
      feel afraid to try something that could be risky. You want to encourage
      people. Now, if people take risks, and a reasonable person in possession
      of the facts can see that a decision was made that was clearly not
      thoughtful, then sure, they should get it right in the teeth for that.
      But nobody thinks that's unreasonable.</p>
<p class="docText">But if they were making a reasonable decision that just turned out
      bad, that just means they took a risk, which means there's a probability
      of something bad happening. And guess what? Sometimes that's the way it
      comes out. And if you don't freak out, but rather embrace it, then
      people feel at ease to take chances. And when they take chances, they
      innovate, and that's where greatness happens.</p>
<p class="docText">And that's why often, companies that are successful start out
      taking a big chance. They get their success, and they spend the rest of
      their corporate lives trying to drive success to zero, because they're
      afraid of losing what they have. And the very act of trying to not lose
      guarantees failure.</p>
