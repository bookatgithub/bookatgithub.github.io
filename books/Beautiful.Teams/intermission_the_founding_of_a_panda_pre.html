<p class="docText">Two months after the rollout of the My.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0184"></a>MP3.com service, it was finally time for the engineering
        department to move to its new building. For months now we had
        patiently waited as Randy Blumhagen, our facilities manager, worked
        his magic, and we were not disappointed. Walking into the building you
        were immediately confronted with a sweeping, curved stairway leading
        to the second floor (the first floor was still gutted and under
        construction at this point), black and blood-red carpet with sweeping
        flame designs awaiting as you crested into a 30 x 60-foot open space
        strewn with stylish furniture&mdash;gentle curves and overstated arms and
        backs&mdash;all designed to match a high-ceilinged, warehousey feel, bounded
        by a row of offices framed up on either side. To your right and left
        were groupings of chairs, couches, and tables&mdash;gathering places for
        "open room" meetings&mdash;with castle turret rounded walls and windows
        overlooking the 805 on one side and the identical "non-engineering"
        building on the other, parking lot filled with shiny cars.</p>
<p class="docText">All in all, the space was more a huge, high-industrial-ceilinged
        warehouse that happened to have a ring of offices on the outer,
        window-facing edge and what looked like a row of two or three shipping
        containers placed end to end&mdash;set about four feet from the outer
        ring of offices and with a half-length football
        field between them. There was another bank of offices, but they were
        dwarfed by the space, which was <span class="docEmphasis">huge</span>. And
        stylish: the offices were beautiful and yet modern, with designs that
        varied by row, some with fishbowl pop-out windows, others
        cave-like.</p>
<p class="docText">I ended up in the row of offices whose outer wall was
        translucent corrugated plastic, opaque enough so that you couldn't see
        through it but allowing some ambient light from the windows to seep
        in, and sharing an office with two other programmers: GK Parish-Philp
        and David Dudas, which, of course, is a story unto itself. You see, as
        the months in cubicle land went from one to the next, it seems that
        the occasional disquiet or minor complaints had been met with the
        reassurance that "once engineering moved into its own space, things
        would change" and the rules would be different. Everything from noise
        issues&mdash;whether talking or quiet music&mdash;to people not wearing shoes was
        met with this perfectly reasonable mantra that allowed everyone to
        (sometimes begrudgingly) get back to work, assured that before too
        long everything would be OK. I suspect that some of these even
        affected the way the space eventually turned out, as I'm not sure we
        would have ended up with offices had it not been for the squeaky wheel
        who was so easily disturbed, which is a testament to the appreciation
        that management had for the engineering staff. These good feelings
        continued as we were asked to pick office mates&mdash;whomever we wanted&mdash;and
        the like.</p>
<p class="docText">But by the time we were getting ready to move in, some of these
        promises seemed to fade away in people's minds: situations had
        changed, "issues" had been forgotten, and, well, any previous
        statements made no longer applied. One issue that came up was that of
        office mates. We had long been promised that we could share an office
        with whomever we liked, but now there were rumblings that managers
        wanted all of their reports sitting together. There didn't seem to be
        any logic behind this, other than it being a control issue and the
        preference of a particular manager or two, but again, the overarching
        management style of "keep the engineers happy" shone through, with (I
        believe) David McCollum going to management and saying, "This is what
        these guys want. Let them sit together. It's more important for the
        work environment to be good than for people to sit with their groups."
        And so it was. And needless to say, the cross-pollination ended up
        being a good thing as well, because it meant that the different
        groups&mdash;applications development, systems, web development&mdash;all had a
        slightly better understanding of who was working on what, and how some
        of the different pieces came together.</p>
