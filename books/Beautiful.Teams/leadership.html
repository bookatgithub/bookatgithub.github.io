<p class="docText">Tim O'Reilly started the company that became O'Reilly Media, Inc.,
      which published this book (and our others, as well). We've always
      personally admired him and the company that he founded, not just for his
      impact on the publishing industry, but also for his impact on the larger
      world of software and software development. We've worked with people
      from almost every part of O'Reilly for years, and we recognize a great
      team when we see it. We wanted to talk to Tim to hear his ideas about
      how he built his team and continues to bring out the best in
      them.</p>
</td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: One thing we noticed when we
    started putting together this book was that everyone seems to have a
    slightly different definition of "team." And it turned out that some of
    the stories we included talk about that question explicitly: whether a
    team is always people who are together temporarily to build some specific
    project, or whether a team can be a group of people who've never
    met</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: We kind of pulled a fast one and just left it open
    to interpretation. So how do you define a team</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: My own experiences are
    around running <a name="idx-CHP-1-0001"></a>a company. Yes, there are team experiences in that. But most
    of the reflections I have are around the broader question of how you exert
    leadership. Let me start at the top, with a few thoughts about leadership
    and management, which are part of the whole team thing. I'm not quite sure
    where the boundaries are.</p>
<p class="docText">There are two quotes I want to start you off with. One is from
    Harold Geneen, who was the guy who started ITT, which was really the first
    modern conglomerate. And he said, "The skill of management is achieving
    your objectives through the efforts of others." So, that's kind of an
    interesting perspective. And the question is of the different styles of
    doing that, where some of them are very directive. This is the classic
    "manager"&mdash;the idea of somebody who figures out what needs to be done, and
    who needs to do it, and builds the teams with the roles, and so on.</p>
<p class="docText">While I completely subscribe to the concept, because the skill of
    management is indeed achieving your objectives through the effort of
    others, I have always worked with the framing of another quote, which is
    actually about writing. It's from Edwin Schlossberg, who wrote a magazine
    article I read early in my career, and it's probably one of the seminal
    things that took root in my brain. He said, "The skill of writing is to
    create a context in which other people can think."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, can you think of how you apply that
    idea&mdash;"creating a context in which other people can think"&mdash;to software
    teams</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: I'll make an observation
    here, and it relates to something I call the architecture of
    participation. In 1998, we did a book called <span class="docEmphasis">Open
    Sources</span>, and we did interviews for some of the people who
    produced their essays on open source. And I don't think it made it into
    the final book, but there's something that Linus Torvalds said in an
    interview that stuck with me: "I couldn't have done what I did with Linux
    for Windows, even if I'd had the Windows source code. It just wasn't
    architected that way." And it really set off a chain of thinking in my
    mind about the architecture of open source projects, and how they're
    designed to allow that sort of free-form improvisation. Because there are
    rules that are laid down.<a name="idx-CHP-1-0002"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It's funny to hear Linus talk about not being able
    to do something&mdash;it's a good reminder that SourceForge.net is littered with
    open source projects that never went anywhere</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: I think one of the reasons
    why certain projects fail is because they're mixing and matching from the
    wrong systems. We have to have a system that has a fundamental <a name="idx-CHP-1-0003"></a>characteristic that there are small
    pieces that people <span class="docEmphasis">can</span> work on independently. I think
    this is why, for example, people have said that they'll do books as Wikis,
    and it hasn't really taken off. Why not? Because a book is a fairly large,
    complex thing with a single narrative thread. Wikipedia is a set of pages,
    and the atomic unit of content is something that a single individual can
    make a plausible promise at, and other people can update and tweak. And
    the whole is the sum of many, many such small parts. I think, for example,
    that there are certain types of works that lend themselves to that kind of
    collaborative activity&mdash;being more free-form precisely because they're
    designed in such a way that the pieces fit together.</p>
<p class="docText">Unix is designed a little more like a set of LEGOs, where the design
    principles are that you have these "innies" and "outies" and they snap
    together. Thinking about pipes and filters and all of those kinds of
    things&mdash;that people can write completely independent utilities with the
    knowledge that they just fit. Most programs read standard in and wrote
    standard out, and there were a few simple rules.</p>
<p class="docText">Similarly, every atomic piece has a manpage. I've always thought, if
    I were given a choice between Windows with <a name="idx-CHP-1-0004"></a>open source code under, say, the GPL, versus Windows with a
    manpage for every little bit of code, what you could swap out and what you
    could change. Yes, you'd have the license issue, but the license wouldn't
    be sufficient. On the other hand, the manpages <span class="docEmphasis">would</span>
    be sufficient, although you'd be violating a few people's
    copyrights.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, what you're saying is that a key to running a
    good project&mdash;open source or otherwise&mdash;is to break it down into pieces that
    people can understand</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: What I'm saying is that
    there's a framework in which you organize people's creativity. And there's
    a whole bunch of principles there. Let me give you a concrete story. Back
    in 1998, when I organized what came to be called the Open Source Summit, I
    had this plausible story about what was happening in the industry. There
    were other people talking about it, notably Eric Raymond, who'd written
    <span class="docEmphasis">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</span>. I'd done the Perl
    conference the year before. We were all thinking about a bunch of things
    in parallel. Netscape had just open sourced their browser, so there was a
    lot of ferment. And I noticed something: the iconic story that was being
    put out by Eric Raymond and others left out the whole BSD world. It was
    all about Linux; it was all about GPL'd software; it was all about the
    ideals of free software.</p>
<p class="docText">Meanwhile, there was this whole other tradition that I looked at.
    And I looked at it and said, "Wow, that tradition has actually had more
    impact." So, for example, I'd go around and say to people, "Tell me the
    top five programs on the Internet." They'd scratch their heads. And I'd
    say, "Number one: BIND, the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon. Every one of
    you has a website that's depending on that program that's maintained by
    this long-haired programmer in Redwood City. Number two, either sendmail
    or Apache. Seventy-five percent of Net email is routed by sendmail." You
    went down the list, and it was all Berkeley software. People weren't
    seeing that story.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-1-0005"></a><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: I remember that at the
    time, there was a lot of controversy around choosing an open source
    license, <a name="idx-CHP-1-0006"></a>GPL versus BSD. It sounds like you found a way to rise above
    that and bring everyone together. How did that happen</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: I brought together all the
    GPL people and all the Berkeley people, and I said, "We have to find out
    what we have in common. We have to tell a story. We have a press
    conference at five o'clock. I don't know what we're going to tell them,
    but we're going to tell 'em something at five." I had a plausible idea
    that there was something really interesting going on here. But I didn't
    know that in the course of that day, wrestling through the issues, what
    that group of 20 people would do. Eric came in and said, "Well, we had
    this meeting a couple weeks ago, and Christine Peterson proposed this new
    name, 'Open Source'." Michael Tiemann of Cygnus says, "Well, we've been
    thinking about this, too. You know; the problem of the name 'free
    software'." And Linus Torvalds said, "I didn't realize that 'free' had two
    meanings in English." And Michael Tiemann says, "Well, we've been using
    the term 'sourceware'."</p>
<p class="docText">So we had a vote. And we said, "We're all going to agree on one
    name, and we're all going to start using it." We voted on "sourceware"
    versus "open source," and "open source" won. We had the press conference
    at five, and the rest is history.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That's interesting, since Jenny and I have written
    about how setting artificial deadlines can have negative consequences for
    teams. It seems like it really helped you guys</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: A lot of what happened was
    that we brought together a very short-term group of people. I had a sense
    that there was something there, but didn't quite know what form it would
    take or ought to take. But I knew I wanted to make something happen. So
    one of the team principles is that creating an artificial deadline&mdash;"We've
    got a press conference at five o'clock, guys"&mdash;can be a pretty powerful
    tool. Now, a lot of companies and a lot of people really misuse that. I've
    seen situations where project managers lie to their teams about deadlines,
    trying to create an artificial sense of urgency. That violates
    trust.</p>
<p class="docText">But when you do it right, identifying that sense of urgency can be
    really good. It's a little bit like what Alexander Pope said about writing
    poetry in rhyming couplets: that the narrow aperture makes creativity
    shoot out like water from a fountain.</p>
<p class="docText">In terms of teams, the other thing that I would just really observe
    is the power of having people with complementary strengths. Right now at
    O'Reilly, I have a very strong chief operating officer, who makes a huge
    difference. We're kind of two halves of a coin. I'm the big-scale
    storytelling, and I spend much less time on internal minutiae of the
    business, which frees me up to do a lot more with that. She's all over the
    day-to-day running of the business, and doing a better job of it than when
    I was trying to do both jobs. Understanding complementary strengths is
    really critical.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I've got a question. A while back, Jenny and I
    wrote a piece for ONLamp called "What Corporate Projects Should Learn from
    Open Source." And subsequently, we've done a talk called "What Makes Open
    Source Work." And what we focused on is the practices
    they use, because that's been our "thing" in the past. You've been talking
    a lot about the team, the personalities, complementary strengths, how to
    work with the people. But one of the things we've found is that if you
    look at the most successful open source projects that we all know and
    love&mdash;like Apache, Linux, Emacs&mdash;you find a lot of great practices. The
    developers, the programmers, the people on the projects voluntarily adopt
    practices that, if they faced in the office, they'd find stifling, even
    though they're the same practices. Practices like adopting a very strict
    build and release process, continuous integration, test-driven
    development</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-1-0007"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Lots and lots of code reviews. We've actually been
    tasked with putting those same practices in place in corporate
    environments and gotten lots of pushback from the very same people. So why
    do you think that is</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: Well, let me put it this
    way. Anyone who's ridden a horse knows that the secret of success is to
    have the horse think that it's doing what it wants. So, I think that when
    people feel like somebody else is telling them what to do, there's going
    to be resistance. If they think it's what they themselves want, then they
    sign right up.</p>
<p class="docText">Lao Tzu said this 2,500 years ago: when the best leader leads, the
    people say we did it ourselves.</p>
<p class="docText">When some people create something really wonderful with an aesthetic
    vision, it seems really obvious. Now that we have the iPod, how could you
    imagine not having touch-screen devices? I remember the first time I
    picked up the Kindle. I started stroking the screen and nothing happened,
    and it was like, "What's wrong?" Now the Kindle has its own pieces of
    truth in it, so to speak&mdash;like the EVDO connectivity, where you go, "Yes,
    that's how it's supposed to work."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I think it's interesting that you're talking about
    how a product's supposed to work. Most of the discussions I've had about
    open source are about things like the GPL versus the BSD license versus
    Creative Commons, and I think people tend to get a little bogged down in
    those details. But you're talking about open source software as a unique
    way of realizing a vision, and I've never actually thought of it that
    way</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: Well, you have to realize
    that people always get hung up on licensing as critical to open source.
    And while it is certainly important, I think as you guys have suggested
    here, the practices are much, much more important. When I think about what
    we've done in our business, first of all books have always been
    user-contributed. Most of our products are created by people who don't
    work for us. We have to put out a plausible idea of something we want to
    get done. We have to find someone who says, "Yeah, that's a good idea, I
    want that, too." We give them coaching, we bring in a host of other people
    to review their work inside the company and outside. We have to impose a
    management system, although it's often very loose. There are a lot of
    different ways to do it, which is one of the reasons I love Larry Wall's
    Perl slogan, "There's more than one way to do it." Because I don't think
    there's any one answer.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Especially not in
    Perl</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: Yes. And take the book
    <span class="docEmphasis">Programming Perl</span>. I could spend six months remaking
    this book to be the kind of book I'd write. Or, I could say, "Wow, it's
    really good just the way it is." Even though it's not the kind of book I'd
    have done myself. So I blessed it and sent it through.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember this one book we published. It's really unfortunate
    because the editor was really fixated on making it into a different kind
    of book, so she spent two years working with the authors to somehow teach
    them, force them, cajole them into doing something other than what they
    were originally imagining. She just couldn't let go. So I said, "There's a
    book here, but it's a different one than you're imagining." What these
    guys had done was written a whole bunch of disconnected pieces. I said,
    "All you have to do now is tell the story of the book so that this makes
    sense."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: I've had a lot of people on my teams tell me
    that</span> Programming Perl <span class="docEmphasis">is one of the best programming
    books ever written. You had an expectation of what the book was going to
    be, but what you were given turned out to be different&mdash;and
    better</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: That's sort of another piece
    to all of this. How do you find what's true in what you're given? I think
    this is almost the root of <a name="idx-CHP-1-0008"></a>intelligence that draws everything else. There are different
    kinds of intelligence. One kind is essentially algorithmic and
    manipulative: you're given all of this data, and you're good at
    manipulating it. You see people who seem like they're really bright in
    some sense, but they're really dumb in other ways. Like they don't see
    things that are obvious, they don't have any common sense. Then you see
    somebody else, and they're not that good at symbol manipulation, can't
    spell, and can't do math. But they're geniuses at looking at a situation
    and understanding what's really going on. And the smartest people have
    both of those qualities. They can look at the world fresh; they can look
    at something and say, "Wow, I see what this can be."</p>
<p class="docText">So, going back to that other book, the editor had all of this
    training, all of these ideas about how a book should look, and what should
    be happening here. And that got in the way of her being able to see the
    material with fresh eyes and understand that the process could be better
    by just helping the authors to do what they wanted anyway.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Do you think that an editor&mdash;or any team leader,
    really&mdash;should try not to have a strong hand in pushing the authors (or the
    team) toward a specific goal</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: Most of my experience is
    very much being a leader, not necessarily being a team member. A great
    deal of it comes from directing people, and I try to direct them in such a
    way that I have as little to do as possible. A lot of that requires seeing
    people's strengths, seeing a situation and saying, "Here's what we can
    make of it."</p>
<p class="docText">It's a kind of pattern recognition, which is going back to how I
    think about the process of editing. It's a little bit like what
    Michelangelo used to say about making a statue; that it's about finding
    the image that's hidden in the stone. I think editing a book is like that.
    <a name="idx-CHP-1-0009"></a>Leading a project is like that. When I started telling the
    story about Web 2.0, it was looking at a bunch of data and uncovering the
    statue that was hidden in the stone. Same thing when I told
    the story about open source. I think that <a name="idx-CHP-1-0010"></a>leading your team is like that also. How do you get a group
    of people to achieve their potential? By seeing who they are, and what
    they can accomplish.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think it's possible to have a great team
    that doesn't have a great leader? That has more of a collective
    leadership</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-1-0011"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: Yes, it is possible. But
    here's the thing. Take <a name="idx-CHP-1-0012"></a>Apache, because I think Apache is the great example of that.
    Tim Berners-Lee laid down the blueprint. He said, "I've created this idea
    for this hypertext server, this hypertext client." And the genius of
    Apache was in embracing the constraints. I still remember back in the
    mid-'90s, this moment where Netscape had added this, <a name="idx-CHP-1-0013"></a>Microsoft had added that, and everyone was saying, "Apache
    seems to be standing still. They aren't adding all these features. They
    aren't keeping up!" And the guys at Apache said, "Yup. What we do is a
    hypertext server, and we have this nice extension mechanism where people
    who want to do something else can add it on."</p>
<p class="docText">And that goes back to that architecture of participation. They
    didn't build this big, conglomerate, complex application. They kept to a
    pure vision. The vision did actually come from a visionary leader; it just
    wasn't part of Apache. Apache came from a group of people who were
    abandoned by the NCSA server team when they all went to found Netscape.
    And there were a bunch of customers, so they said, "We have to maintain
    this, and keep it going." What was wonderful about that kind of team was
    that they accepted the constraints that were laid down by the design of
    the <a name="idx-CHP-1-0014"></a>system. They didn't try to show off their ego or their
    creativity.</p>
<p class="docText">I think a lot of the work done by the IETF (the Internet Engineering
    Task Force) in the early years did the same thing. There were some
    wonderful principles laid down, and people really honored them. If you
    read some of John Postel's stuff in the TCP RFC about the robustness
    principle, it sounds like something out of the Bible, for Christ's sake!
    "Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from
    others." Literally, that's what it says.</p>
<p class="docText">The point is that if you have the system architected right, you have
    a better chance of <a name="idx-CHP-1-0015"></a>success for teams. You don't want teams that are dependent
    on a single vision or leader, because if you lose your leader, the whole
    team goes "pop."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Speaking of things going "pop," can you think of
    anything from your past where things didn't go so well? Maybe a disaster
    or two that maybe you learned something important from</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: There are probably quite a
    few disasters over the years, some of them which were turned into
    successes after the fact.</p>
<p class="docText">These aren't disasters, but they are <a name="idx-CHP-1-0016"></a>failures&mdash;they're choices, going back to an aspect of
    leadership. Things can go wrong. Look at what happened here with
    <a name="idx-CHP-1-0017"></a>Yahoo! and Microsoft. Everybody's out there saying that they
    can't make up their minds whether Jerry Yang or Steve Ballmer is the
    bigger loser, because there was a badly mismanaged process without a clear
    vision of what was the right thing to do. But we might end up looking back
    and saying, "Wow, Jerry <a name="idx-CHP-1-0018"></a>was brilliant. He kept Yahoo! independent, and then he had a
    strategy that pulled his hat out of the fire." Can you imagine? Just like
    you look back at the early history of the PC, at the deal that Bill Gates
    had cut with IBM. What if IBM had been the sharp dealer? We'd have a very
    different history. So we don't really know.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Right, what we think of as a set-in-stone success
    now might not even have seemed like a wise choice at the time. You make a
    series of choices, and the chips fall where they may. Is that how you see
    your own successes and failures</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: I see in those kinds of
    moments the impact of choices. At O'Reilly, we did the first web portal.
    We did GNN, the Global Network Navigator, the pre-Yahoo!, the original
    portal of Internet sites. I was focused and I did not want to give up
    control of my company, so we sold GNN to AOL. I did reason correctly that
    unless I wanted to give up control of my company and take on investors, I
    wouldn't be able to keep up with the growth of the Internet. I'd read this
    wonderful book called <span class="docEmphasis">Marketing High Technology</span> by
    William Davidow (Free Press), an early venture capitalist. He said that
    it's simple math. Dominating a market means being more than half the
    market, and growing faster than the market as a whole. I looked at the
    Internet and said, "We can't do that, a private company that's completely
    self-funded. With the way that the Internet's exploding, there's no way we
    won't get marginalized. We have to either take in money or sell." So I
    sold. It was a big inexperience premium, so to speak. Jerry and David took
    in venture money, and went on to create a multibillion-dollar company
    despite the recent travails. I think, from a purely financial point of
    view, they did much better than we did. That being said, I was clear what
    my personal goals were: to keep an independent company where I could do
    what I wanted, and I've been doing it ever since.</p>
<p class="docText">I guess the point I'd make is that failure and success are relative
    to what you're trying to accomplish. If we'd been a venture-backed
    start-up, my decision would have been a disastrous failure. As a
    self-funded entrepreneur who was making my own choices, it was my choice
    to make or not. What I'm trying to get at here is that it's really
    important not to second-guess a "failure," because a failure may be a
    choice.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: But don't you need to have some sort of final
    accounting? In the end, a project either succeeds or it fails,
    right</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: We have this idea that's
    very binary, that it's failure or success. We're trying to choose from a
    set of alternative futures. There's no best, there's just choice.</p>
<p class="docText">I think we've lost in many cases, both in business and in the design
    of software&mdash;the design of any work product, really&mdash;the importance of the
    aesthetic. Wallace Stevens wrote a book of essays called <span class="docEmphasis">The
    Necessary Angel</span> (Vintage). In it, one of the points he made was
    that we have the idea that choice matters. He had a poem called "Notes
    towards a Supreme Fiction." He had the idea that perhaps God was a fiction
    that we can all believe in. The goal in religion or even in science is to
    create an aesthetic vision that we can each believe in. You're trying to
    enroll people.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-1-0019"></a><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I can hear a reader who
    works in a corporate environment building a database application reading
    that and thinking, "There's no aesthetic in what I'm
    doing."</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: And I would say, "Go look at
    Steve <a name="idx-CHP-1-0020"></a>Jobs." That'd be my answer&mdash;he's a testament to the power of
    the aesthetic. He made a set of choices. For many, they feel that
    <a name="idx-CHP-1-0021"></a>Apple screwed up because they didn't go with the dominant
    paradigm. They followed their own way, and their own <a name="idx-CHP-1-0022"></a>aesthetic vision. Each time, he's been able to come back
    again and again because he has a compelling vision that he's been able to
    sell to people. People talk about the "Steve Jobs reality distortion
    field"&mdash;that's what it's all about. He can create a compelling vision that
    other people sign up for.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember one of my key employees laughing at me, saying, "I'd have
    a meeting with you, and I'd go away, and I've said 'yes' to all these
    things you've said. Then I go away and think, 'I don't actually believe
    all that stuff!'" I was able to persuade her. And that goes back to what
    may be an interesting observation. I remember when my company got beyond
    about fifty people. There was this moment when I really had to change how
    I worked, because I really had this experience in the early years of the
    company where I held people in my "reality distortion field," so to
    speak&mdash;everybody in the company at the same time. It was a small enough
    group and we were all working closely together.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember when I was in high school I used to sneak out at night in
    my father's car. So he wouldn't be able to hear, I'd have to push it out
    of the driveway and down the block before I started the engine. So I'd be
    pushing the car, and there'd be this feeling that you're pushing on this
    thing, and you're pushing and pushing, and gradually it starts to
    accelerate. I had that feeling with the people in the company&mdash;"Wow, this
    thing is just too heavy." So I had to let go. Then, I would talk to a few
    people at a time. You'd set people free to go do their thing, and then
    you'd check in.</p>
<p class="docText">There's a science fiction book I read early in my career that was
    very influential, a book called <span class="docEmphasis">Rissa Kerguelen</span> by F.
    M. Busby (Berkeley). Not that many people have read it. One of the key
    concepts that many people have played with over the years, particularly in
    the '50s and '60s (this book was written in the '70s), was the idea of
    time dilation. As you get close to the speed of light, one of the
    Einsteinian paradoxes is that the inertial frame is different and time
    goes much more slowly for the person traveling at high speed. Many science
    fiction stories would involve people going off and coming back, and
    everybody's very old. So this book, <span class="docEmphasis">Rissa Kerguelen</span>,
    had three parts, and one of them was called "The Long View." It was about
    how you do planning when you're about to go on an interstellar voyage, and
    you're going to show up 15 years later by planetary time. The idea is that
    you have to set something in motion, and then meet up with it. And I think
    there's something very powerful in that image, the fact that the things we
    were talking about earlier&mdash;the architecture of various systems&mdash;that's a
    way you set something in motion. And you can rendezvous with it, and find
    if it's developed in the way you expected. That was how I began to think
    about what I had to do in the company. I had to set things in motion and
    then go meet up with them.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: How did your team initially
    react when you started pulling away</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: There are definitely cycles
    where people feel their own oats. They want to be the leader, and they
    want to take things in a different direction. And I think one thing about
    being a good leader is to know when somebody has the chops to do that. I'm
    a Celtics fan, and I remember there was a great story from the Larry Bird
    era. It was crunch time at the end of a basketball game&mdash;this was when K.
    C. Jones was coach. They'd come to the huddle, and Larry says, "Just give
    me the ball and everybody get out of the way." And K. C. says, "Larry, I'm
    the coach, so shut up! OK, everybody? Let's get Larry the ball, and
    everybody get out of the way."</p>
<p class="docText">So, sometimes people move ahead, and your job as coach or leader is
    to say, "Yeah, they're right, give it to them." I've had that relationship
    with Dale Dougherty a lot. Dale is actually responsible for a big part of
    O'Reilly's success. A great many things that are attributed to me, he
    played a major role in. He was the guy who originally got us into the
    World Wide Web. He was the guy who came up with the name "Web 2.0." He's
    currently the publisher of <span class="docEmphasis">MAKE Magazine</span>. It kind of
    feels like a dance in which he goes off and does his own thing, and then
    it comes back together. Sometimes it feels like a sibling relationship,
    where we're struggling over who's driving the bus. Other times we're
    really in harmony. You want people who will argue with you. You want
    people who have their own vision.</p>
<p class="docText">When you have a vision of something that is true&mdash;and I don't know
    what true means, if it's absolute truth or just aesthetic truth. When
    things just work, when you hear that perfect chord in music, when you see
    the line in a drawing or the curve of stone in a statue, and you go,
    "Beauty is truth, and truth beauty, that is all ye know on earth, and all
    ye need to know"&mdash;you know, the Keats line&mdash;that's how things come together.
    For me, the essence of getting people to work together is to have an
    aesthetic vision that you can get them to sign up for. Where you build a
    shared vision of the truth that you're building, where you've expressed an
    ideal. Because then you set people free to pursue that ideal on their
    own.</p>
