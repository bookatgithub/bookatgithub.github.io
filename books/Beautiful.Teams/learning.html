<h3 id="title-IDASWKVC" class="docSection1Title">15.5. Learning</h3>
<p class="docText">Paul and Alex were fairly new employees at BBS, with one or two
        years of experience, if I remember correctly. I got to spend the most
        time with them. The senior people kept getting pulled into meetings,
        so the three of us had plenty of time to work. Being the seasoned
        journeyman, it was like having two apprentices. We worked day to day,
        incrementally developing. Like I mentioned earlier, I was at BBS only
        every other week, on average. So on Fridays, we would plan the next
        week's work.<a name="idx-CHP-15-0411"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Paul and Alex were great. They always got everything done that
        we planned on doing. The code was well tested and it delivered the
        desired functionality. As their mentor, I reviewed their work when I
        returned the following Monday. They always got the code to work, but
        they usually put some code in the wrong place. What I was detecting
        was something that Martin Fowler calls "<a name="idx-CHP-15-0412"></a>feature envy" [4].</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-15-0413"></a>Code problems now have names! Fowler and Beck did a fine
        job naming and describing a small catalog of "code smells." Feature
        envy was where one class was doing the job of another class. There
        were others: long method, large class, long parameter list, lazy
        class, and shotgun surgery, to name a few. Just having the name for
        some undesirable code quality helped us detect problems early and keep
        the code clean.</p>
<p class="docText">So, Alex and Paul would leave these small code problems around,
        but it was no big deal; Monday became refactoring day. We had the
        tests, so it was easy and low-risk to move the envious code to its
        proper home. It was a learning experience. I would never have known to
        call it <span class="docEmphasis">feature envy</span> before XP. Paul and Alex
        could have been defensive about their work, but the learning spirit
        avoided hurt feelings. They also taught me plenty during our pairing
        sessions.</p>
<p class="docText">After a few cycles of this, it became a game. Paul and Alex
        would get the work done, and start hunting for code smells. On Monday
        mornings, I would come in, get a coffee, and find
        them. Paul would say, "James, we got all the tests passing, but there
        are a few things you are not going to like." They were building skill
        in the first step to being successful refactorers! They had to find
        and identify code smells. They did not always know how to solve the
        smells, but they learned how to recognize the problems. Awareness is
        the first step toward change.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-15-0414"></a>Pair <a name="idx-CHP-15-0415"></a>programming really helped break <a name="idx-CHP-15-0416"></a>down communication barriers. When you sit next to
        someone for a few hours you reveal your own strengths and weaknesses.
        It's a two-way street. With the right people and the right attitude,
        learning happens and trust grows. Our team atmosphere was such that it
        was safe to make mistakes and to learn.</p>
