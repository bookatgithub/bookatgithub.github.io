<p class="docText">By Friday, it was clear that Fred was struggling with the
        performance enhancement. He hadn't made any progress yet. Tim had just
        finished his feature work, <a name="idx-CHP-27-0862"></a>and was ready to work with Fred. I sent my status report
        to the team and the higher-level status report to Nancy and Big
        Cheese. I was reviewing everyone's tasks to see whether we could
        rearrange anything to help Fred. I was pretty sure he needed Dan's
        help, too, to see other options.</p>
<p class="docText">Big Cheese arrived at my office, and said, "I need to talk to
        you now, Johanna." Big Cheese strode in and stood over my
        shoulder.</p>
<p class="docText">I glanced up at him, and said, "OK, let me just save what I'm
        doing."</p>
<p class="docText">"No. Stop doing that and listen to me."</p>
<p class="docText">I turned around, and asked, "What's the problem?" I motioned to
        my visitor chair. He shook his head.</p>
<p class="docText">"I have no problem. You, however, have a big problem. Stop those
        code reviews. They're slowing down the project." Big Cheese shook his
        finger in my face.</p>
<p class="docText">"But then we won't know where the bugs are. We need the code
        reviews."</p>
<p class="docText">Big Cheese stood yet closer to me. He shouted, "Stop them or
        I'll fire you." By now his face was red.</p>
<p class="docText">I stood up. "You'll fire me for doing the right thing?" Big
        Cheese wasn't a tall man, but I'm not tall either. I came up to his
        shoulder. But that was better than sitting down, at gut-height. Big
        Cheese took one step back.</p>
<p class="docText">"In this case, the right thing is to finish the project as fast
        as possible. Stop those code reviews. I expect to see more progress
        next week."</p>
<p class="docText">Big Cheese left my office. I took a deep breath and walked over
        to Nancy's office, but Big Cheese was already there, screaming at her.
        I decided to wait to talk to her.</p>
