<p class="docText">Every project has its lone wolf, who, for reasons unknown to
        most of the team, appears to not want to be part of the team, lacking
        bedside manners. We had one of those, an extremely smart and talented
        person who had no patience for the "normal" people. He was extremely
        fast and constantly surprised us with his innovation. We remember that
        he got the Forms Management package to speed up performance by a
        factor of 4 or 5 because he just dug around into Unix until he found a
        few obscure interface calls. All that was said to him was that the
        package was running too slowly for many. He grumbled about how they
        should appreciate what they had, walked away, and came back two days
        later, all smiles and with a new version that ran four or five times
        faster &#8230; and we didn't even know that he was working on it.</p>
<p class="docText">But his aloofness turned out to be very <a name="idx-CHP-17-0517"></a>difficult for many. It bothered the team; we wanted to
        bring him in, we felt it would really improve team collaboration since
        he was one of the most knowledgeable in the group. We don't know
        exactly what caused the change, but one of the members of the team, a
        smart lady with degrees in both music and computer science and with
        great wit, became his friend and broke through his glass shell. We
        think after that, he started trusting and actually enjoying some
        members of the team. Life in the project became so much better after
        that. The lesson here is that if people care and take their time, ways
        can be found to include everyone.</p>
