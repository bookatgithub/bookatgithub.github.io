<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">We started this book by
        interviewing Tim O'Reilly because we felt that he covered a wide range
        of topics that we'd delve into later on. One of the things that Tim
        did was draw a parallel between teams of developers and how groups of
        musicians work together. That piqued our interest, and we wanted to
        dig a little deeper.</span></p>
</td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: I have to say that my
      greatest weakness as a team leader, to be quite honest, has always been
      that I've always taken what's available and tried to make something of
      it, rather than an engineering approach&mdash;we need one of these, and one of
      these, and one of these&mdash;and building something out of nothing.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: That's actually my question. As you were talking,
      one of the things you said really resonated with me. The traditional way
      to handle deciding what you're going to build is getting everybody to
      agree on that up front. It sounds like you're more interested in the
      discovery process, allowing people to come to whatever truth comes from
      the experience. How do you reconcile that?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: Well, yes and no. It's a
      good question. It's so paradoxical, because it sounds like when you say
      whatever truth comes from the experience&mdash;that sounds very California and
      New Age. When I say, "uncover the statue in the stone," it's really
      there. There's not more than one. Well, maybe there's a couple, but it's
      not like any old thing works. It's not like you can just go with the
      flow and do what you feel. There's an aesthetic vision that drives the
      process.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, the leader has to carry that
      vision?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: Yes, absolutely. You have
      to know what you're going for. And what you're doing is going back to
      the idea of humming a tune and getting other people to follow it. Well,
      there is an idea there of harmony. There is an idea there because there
      is a tune, and somebody can be off-key. It's not like everyone can go
      hum their own tune. This is the tune. Find it, converge. And that's the
      skill in bringing a creative team together.</p>
<p class="docText">Going back to the analogy of humming the tune, and having people
      learn to play it on their own instruments: if people are accomplished
      musicians, they can do that. Then they can actually start to elaborate
      on the tune, they can build on what you've done. But it starts what in
      open source what Eric Raymond calls a "plausible promise." There is an
      aesthetic vision there where people say, "Yeah, I get it, I want to be
      part of that." Then they can express their own creativity. And if you've
      done it right, you haven't overspecified, you haven't told people what
      to do or how to do it. You've just given them a vision of where you're
      going, and they find their own way there.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: OK, I've got a question. There are definitely
      some really skilled, really amazing band leaders. Like, say, Count
      Basie, who's famous for not using as much sheet music and charts, and
      really having musicians who work exactly like that. But I'm sure history
      is littered with the names of bands we don't know with people who tried
      to work like that and weren't able to. And that's
      one thing that we've seen a lot in software projects specifically.
      You'll have really talented people, and a leader who's really smart and
      talented, yet the team has a lot of trouble getting software out the
      door</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: And a lot of what I've
      done in my career has been to tell stories that help people to organize
      their own activity. So, I'm a very non-directive leader or manager. In
      fact, I often joke that I'm kind of like the title character in the '50s
      musical <span class="docEmphasis">The Music Man</span>. You know the story, the guy
      was a con man who sold instruments, and said that he'd teach the kids to
      play music. But of course, he didn't know anything about music. He said
      he had this new system called the "Think System," where he'd hum the
      tune and the kids would figure out how to play it on their own
      instruments. And of course, it works out in the story; the kids do kind
      of figure it out, and it works out just in time to save him because he's
      fallen in love with the town librarian.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Could you run a real band like
      that?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: Well, you could, of
      course, if you had very skilled players. In fact, that's what jazz is
      all about.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I guess you're right&mdash;that's pretty much how
      Count Basie ran his band</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tim</span>: A jazz band is the Think
      System applied. Somebody puts out an idea, and someone else picks up on
      it. I still remember, actually, when Jeff Bezos and I talked to various
      congressional people about the patent system. One of the congressmen,
      well known; we were trying to make the analogy of how invention works,
      and that it's a little bit like jazz. And he totally got it, because he
      was a big jazz fan. "Oh my God! What if all of those jazz riffs were
      patented, and you couldn't take them and run with them?"</p>
<p class="docText">So, I think in a lot of ways that gets to the heart of something.
      If you have good enough people who are motivated and excited and
      skilled, you can in fact hum a tune and have them pick up and improvise
      on it. And that's what I've done through a whole lot of my career.
      That's not to say there isn't a lot of hands-on. But even that is in the
      form of storytelling. The team of editor and writer, for example,
      introducing a book: the way that I would often do it is that I would
      rewrite something and show them, and then they'd say, "Oh yeah, I get
      that now." As an editor, that's also how I'd work with assistant
      editors&mdash;I'd kind of demonstrate stuff, and they'd demonstrate back what
      they took away from me. And then, when I said, "Yeah, you've got it,"
      I'd have less and less to do.</p>
<p class="docText">I know I've said two very contradictory things here, because I
      said, "finding the statue that's in the stone," but I also said,
      "articulating a vision that other people can believe in." One of those
      things sounds like there is the ideal form sitting there in the form,
      where there's only one. In the other, you can make anything out of
      anything. And the truth is somewhere in between. What it feels like from
      the inside, when you get it right, is like doing harmony in music. There
      are a lot of different harmonies possible, but you do have to converge
      on something.</p>
<p class="docText">So in some sense, I think that analogy is probably a pretty good
      one. There are some underlying things that make a situation work, that
      make it come together. That's something else that's
      a big part of my thinking&mdash;Alfred Korzybski, with general semantics: "The
      map is not the territory." The map matches the territory. And when you
      create an aesthetic vision that somehow matches a territory, that
      somehow makes the thing more what it is, then you get people to follow
      you. And when you seed that moment, when you're able to articulate a
      vision, you get people to sign up for it. And together you build
      something that is true, and feels true.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">As we were editing our interview with Tim, we felt
        that this one section really stood on its own, because it said
        something to us. We felt that it made a poignant statement about how
        teams can revolve around a single visionary leader, and that one
        leader can bring everyone together under an overarching vision. But he
        said something else that struck us: in a way, he erased the line
        between a vision for a project and an artistic vision.
        </span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">We felt that these ideas needed more exploration. So,
        we sought out an expert in how musicians work together, and we were
        thrilled that Tony Visconti could take the time to talk to us. Both of
        us have been fans of a lot of his work over the years, even when we
        didn't necessarily know that he was behind the music. Tony has spent
        his entire career figuring out how to get groups&mdash;teams, if you will&mdash;of
        musicians to work together.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">We weren't sure exactly how this would turn out. But
        what really took us by surprise is just how much of what Tony said
        echoed many of the things that our other contributors said throughout
        the book. While you're reading this interview, keep your eyes open for
        them: see if you can spot ideas, sentiments, and opinions that reflect
        other things you've read over the past few hundred
        pages.</span></p>
