<h3 id="title-IDAM0E5L" class="docSection1Title">2.3. My Wabi-Sabi Team: Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
<p class="docText">In 1995, I joined the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft. It
        was a small, fledgling project manned by a handful of people. It
        didn't even earn a spot in Windows 95. Microsoft's first web browser
        was released to the world, exclusively, as an undercard feature on the
        $49 add-on to Windows known as the Plus Pack.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-2-FNOTE-5">[]</a></sup> But with Netscape's rise and the industrywide hope that
        the rise of Netscape would signal the end of Microsoft, the team
        exploded in importance. The executives at Microsoft, ever paranoid and
        supremely skilled at chasing taillights, famously turned the company
        on a dime and made the Internet a central part of every strategy and
        tactic across the company. By version 4.0, the project team consisted
        of more than 100 people, enough to dominate two entire floors of
        Building 27 on the north side of Microsoft's campus.<a name="idx-CHP-2-0036"></a></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-2-FNOTE-5">[]</a></sup> Even the marketing team wasn't sure if this web browser
            thing was going to pan out, as more surefire features like a
            desktop theme manager, hard drive compressor (hey, it was 1995),
            and background task scheduler earned equal or better
            billing.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">In 1997, the Internet Explorer team began its fateful voyage
        into version 4.0. In the history of software, few projects faced as
        many evils as we would in a single year.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-2-FNOTE-6">[]</a></sup> A litany of reorgs, executive battles, leaked design
        plans, impossible goals, DOJ antitrust lawsuits, and revolving-door
        middle management, all while bearing the weight of responsibility to
        save the company from the greatest threat, at least according to the
        rest of the industry, it had ever seen.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-2-FNOTE-7">[]</a></sup> If you threw in a few plagues and natural disasters,
        we'd be able to check every item off the list of the major calamities
        no manager ever wants to face.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-2-FNOTE-6">[]</a></sup> I'm not proud of this fact, but I've yet to hear a story
            that tops the drama of IE4 given the stage it played out on. If
            you have a nomination, however, I'd love to hear it. Miserable
            project survivors love company.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-2-FNOTE-7">[]</a></sup> Don't take my word for it. Two books have been written about
            this period of time at Microsoft. See <span class="docEmphasis">How the Web Was
            Won</span> by Paul Andrews (Broadway), which is ridiculously
            positive about all things Microsoft. Alternatively,
            <span class="docEmphasis">Competing on Internet Time</span> by Michael A.
            Cusumano and David B. Yoffie (Free Press) presents a more balanced
            story told from the Netscape perspective, but focuses more on
            strategy than the personalities or tactics.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">But the trap that would be the team's undoing had been set
        ourselves: despair and hubris. The first three releases had been
        successes. Internet Explorer 1.0 was a simple retrofit of the
        purchased Spyglass browser. Version 2.0 made steady progress and was
        out the door in a few months. Then 3.0, the first major release,
        showed the world that Microsoft was not dead, had caught up, had added
        some new ideas, and was a contender in the game. And with a stockpile
        of resources in place on both sides, the fourth wave of the browser
        wars began. Both sides bet as big as they could, failing to recognize
        that the nature of the project had fundamentally changed. Like a cocky
        kid juggler who suddenly realizes he has more balls in the air than he
        can even see, much less catch, our team fell apart.</p>
<p class="docText">The center of our despair was called
        <span class="docEmphasis">Channels</span>. In 1997, the world was convinced that
        the future of the Web was in "<a name="idx-CHP-2-0037"></a>push technology," the ability for websites to push
        content out to customers (a predecessor to the RSS feeds used by blogs
        today). Instead of people searching the Web, the content would be
        smart and find its way to people, downloading automatically and
        appearing in their bookmark list, on their desktops, in their email,
        or in desktop widgets and dashboards yet to be invented. We called
        this feature <span class="docEmphasis">Channels</span>, and it was led by a small
        team. While they scrambled to design how it would work, the business
        folks raced their counterparts at Netscape to court major websites
        like Disney and ESPN. We needed their content to make the whole thing
        work: having the pipes is one thing, but it's another to have
        something to push through them.<a name="idx-CHP-2-0038"></a></p>
<p class="docText">In the frenzy to make deals and catch up with the hype, we lost
        ourselves. Innovation cannot be achieved with one hand on a rulebook
        and the other over a fire. The deals we made forced legal contracts
        into the hands of the development team: the use of data from these
        websites had many restrictions and we had to follow them, despite the
        fact that few doing the design work had seen them before they were
        signed. Like the day the <span class="docEmphasis">Titanic</span> set sail with
        thousands of defective rivets, our fate was sealed well before the
        screaming began. Despite months of work, the Channels team failed to
        deliver. The demos were embarrassing. The answers to basic questions
        were worse. Soon, word of the Channels project's downward spiral
        spread across the team and the company, taking the reputation of the
        entire project with it. If this was the bet all of Microsoft was
        making, we'd already lost.</p>
<p class="docText">The <a name="idx-CHP-2-0039"></a>Internet Explorer team was never a place in shortage of
        opinions&mdash;loud, passionate, sarcastic, and occasionally abusive
        opinions. Disagreements among executives grew into denial and
        inaction, causing the opinionated to yell louder and with more venom.
        No one could survive the cauldron we'd brewed for ourselves, and
        eventually the project manager for Channels was crushed and burnt out.
        Soon he was replaced, as was his manager. Then they were both
        replaced. In the churn, without a taskmaster to keep them at bay, the
        twisty tentacles of Channels spread across the project, infecting
        code, design, and morale. If enough big things go wrong, everyone
        becomes incompetent. Everyone gets <a name="idx-CHP-2-0040"></a>ugly. People quit. Despair rose. Managers stormed out of
        meetings and heavy things were thrown across boardrooms. Months flew
        by and therapy bills rose. As other parts of the project were
        completed, we tried not to notice the gaping Channels-shaped black
        hole at our center, slowly pulling everything inside.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't know how it started, but somewhere
        in our fourth reorg, under our third general manager and with our
        fifth project manager for Channels, the gallows humor began. It is
        here that the seeds of team <span class="docEmphasis">wabi-sabi</span> are sown.
        Pushed so far beyond what any of us expected, our sense of humor
        shifted into black-death Beckett mode. It began when we were facing
        yet another ridiculous, idiotic, self-destructive decision where all
        options were comically bad. "Feel the love," someone would say. It was
        some kind of bad self-help jargon, but it was so far from our reality
        that it worked. Sometimes we'd add a smiley face after it in an email
        when making a request we knew was absurd. Or we'd mockingly pat each
        other on the back as we said it, reinforcing how phony and clich&eacute;d the
        sentiment was.</p>
<p class="docText">It worked, because we knew we were all in the same misery, and
        that on that particular day, more of it had landed on one person than
        another. On the day I saw months of people's work, including my own,
        being cut at random, just one slash on a list in a half-day-long
        marathon of slashes, without any logic or chance for defense, someone
        would say in an email, "Feel the love! It's IE4!" Toward the end, I
        once saw it scribbled on a whiteboard, waiting for us at a meeting of
        team leaders. Even our group manager had to laugh when he saw it,
        connecting with us in our sardonic lifeline of morale. That moment
        changed something for me and for the team: he felt the same way. If we
        couldn't escape our fates, at least we weren't insane for
        acknowledging them for what they were.</p>
<p class="docText">Late in the project, I became the sixth, and last, program
        manager for Channels. My job was to get something out quickly for the
        final beta release, and do what damage control I could before it went
        out the door in the final release. When we pulled it off and found a
        mostly positive response from the world, we had the craziest ship
        party I'd ever seen. It wasn't the champagne, or the venue, or even
        how many people showed up. It was how little of the many tables of
        food was eaten: in just a few minutes, most of it had been lovingly
        thrown at teammates and managers. I received the largest glob of
        guacamole ever absorbed by a human head, and somewhere someone has a
        photo to prove it.</p>
<p class="docText">The true <span class="docEmphasis">wabi-sabi</span> bonds grew in the
        aftermath. The few who remained to work on Internet Explorer 5.0 had a
        special bond. We had seen each other at our worst, and still felt
        respect. We all knew the true horrors of what could happen, and could
        trust each other not to let it happen again. In one of our earliest
        planning meetings, the entire conversation revolved around how to kill
        Channels and eliminate it from the face of the project. In the months
        that followed, my powers as a leader were enhanced by the fact that I
        could look certain programmers in the eye and trust them completely,
        having seen, firsthand, how well they'd dealt with tough situations,
        and they could do the same with me. We had the confidence, grown from
        our ugly, desperate, but collective struggles, to focus on real
        problems we knew customers had, no matter what hype and trends pundits
        were passionately guessing about. Internet Explorer 5.0 would be the
        best project team I'd ever work on, and one of the best software
        releases in Microsoft's history. That might not mean much to anyone
        else, but it's a beautiful thing to me.</p>
