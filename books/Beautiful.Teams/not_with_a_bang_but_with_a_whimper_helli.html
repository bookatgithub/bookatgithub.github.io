<p class="docText">Even before moving into the new offices, we had been sued for
        <a name="idx-CHP-7-0188"></a>copyright infringement by the RIAA (on behalf of the
        major record labels), the Harry Fox Agency, which owned the publishing
        rights to a large portion of the songs in our "library," and a number
        of smaller record labels. <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-7-FNOTE-8">[]</a></sup> This had happened January 21, 10 long days after we had
        gone live with My.MP3.com. While this wasn't entirely unexpected, it
        was slightly worrisome, especially the language in some of the
        reports: "clear case of copyright infringement&#8230;" etc. Special "All
        Staff" meetings were called where we were told how this was normal and
        to be expected. We received updates and assurances in the weekly
        Chairman's Chat about how we were doing, who we were talking to, how
        we had enough money in the bank and were fine, but it was worrisome.
        Meanwhile, we hadn't stopped ripping CDs; instead, we were adding
        1,500 new CDs to our database per day.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-7-FNOTE-8">[]</a></sup> Songs have two types of copyrights: the publishing rights
            and the recording rights. Each has to be licensed separately
            depending on the use.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">All said and done, though, I don't remember much open talk or
        concern about our demise. I'm not sure if this is because people had
        drunk the Kool-Aid and believed we would be OK&mdash;after all, it was in
        their best interest to believe this (who wants to be unhappy and all
        doom and gloom when it's your potential fortune at risk)&mdash;or if people
        just weren't talking about it. To be honest, there was a certain air
        of invincibility that we carried with us: we had a dream team of
        engineers assembled, had solved every challenge which faced us, had
        revenue streams &#8230; it didn't seem like anything could affect us. We
        were changing the world. It was obvious to us that this was the next
        step for music, that the record labels were behind the times and would
        have to come around sooner or later to the fact that music was going
        to be distributed digitally, that DRM was dead in the water and always
        would be, and that here we were, providing them with a tailor-made
        service, complete with top-notch statistical reporting so that they
        knew <span class="docEmphasis">exactly</span> how many times a song was played,
        and by whom. The data mining opportunities were endless, the
        opportunities in general were endless, and really, it would just allow
        them to reach more consumers. In fact, we wanted to pay them money in
        licensing. We were already seeking to pay artists directly when their
        songs were played, just so that they would get the royalties that they
        deserved. How could this not work?</p>
<p class="docText">But as time went on, as more <a name="idx-CHP-7-0189"></a>and more court dates came and passed, some of this
        optimism faded, too. People all over the company were leaving in dribs
        and drabs. They left for different reasons&mdash;some had reached dead ends
        because they had fallen from favor, not able to work on anything
        interesting, but instead just passing the time (and becoming less
        productive as a result), others because they were bored at the
        direction the company was going: we had shifted into "make money,
        maintain/upgrade infrastructure" mode and away from the initial
        "change the world" mindset which had been so exciting in the
        beginning. Sure, My.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0190"></a>MP3.com was an attempt at changing the world, but it was
        built, and mid-flight we were merely watching to see if it cleared the
        earth's orbit or got sucked back down. It was our world-changing shot,
        and the rest of our resources were geared toward opportunities which
        would bring in revenue, and these were rarely world-changing.</p>
<p class="docText">Then, we had our first layoff in engineering. There had been
        culls in other departments before, but we had never really been
        affected up until now; we had been somehow safe. I found out recently
        that the folks in the other building referred to the engineering
        building as the Panda Preserve: the place where the rare breed got all
        the appropriate care and feeding and was removed from all the dangers
        of the real world. No more. The glass had been shattered.</p>
<p class="docText">Mind you, some (all?) of the people who were laid off in the
        first round had ceased to perform for whatever reason&mdash;morale, burnout,
        or just being given fewer opportunities, resulting in a general
        decline in productivity. It was hard to go from "top of the world" to
        "we're giving you the grunt work because you pissed someone off," just
        as it was difficult to keep up the hectic pace that a lot of people
        were putting in, especially when there was always someone who was
        willing to step up and take your place, either someone within the
        company or someone who was thrilled at the chance to work for MP3.com.
        I think my dear friend and former cubicle mate, James Park, left in
        that cull. He had never been the same after the My.MP3.com release:
        for whatever reason, be it the JavaScript, his ignorance of the
        hierarchy and bringing people in to meetings, or possibly something as
        simple as merely dropping by a My.MP3.com release party but not
        staying for hours to hang out with the managers and engineers who made
        the site work, he somehow dropped to second-class-citizen status. He
        had never really been given a chance to prove himself again.</p>
<p class="docText">Personally, I was still enjoying the work at MP3.com, but I was
        starting to entertain thoughts about my general career trajectory. I
        had entered MP3.com a person who wanted to work with other geeks, who
        was searching for that camaraderie and circle of peers that would
        provide a rapport and, in the end, raise the level of the work I
        performed through collaboration and the bar set by those surrounding
        me. The one other thing I had been looking for was the ability to
        change the world. Three months before interviewing at MP3.com, I had
        been discussing the future of music in the digital age with a fellow
        traveler from the Netherlands. Here I had the opportunity to effect
        that change.</p>
<p class="docText">But as the company moved on, as we stopped focusing on the
        My.MP3.com service&mdash;or at least, while it was in legal limbo&mdash;and as the
        motives of senior management started to come into question
        (whisperings of "cashing out" and "selling us out so they can become
        millionaires" being heard for the first time), I started <a name="idx-CHP-7-0191"></a>reconsidering what I was here for.</p>
<p class="docText">For the first time, I started to feel like
        my path was actually in chemical engineering (which I held a degree in
        but had never pursued, as Boulder had been lacking in entry-level
        chemical engineering jobs). This gut feeling was strengthened by the
        fact that I felt slightly out of my depth "academically" with some of
        the people around me: I had taken computer science courses, but
        perhaps didn't have the same level of in-depth theory that they did. I
        was able to do my job, but it served as a juxtaposition: I
        <span class="docEmphasis">did</span> have that knowledge in chemical engineering,
        why wasn't I going that route and bringing all of my resources to
        bear? These thoughts, coupled with a feeling coming into this job that
        if the "being a programmer at a dot-com surrounded by amazing
        programmers isn't my bag, then I'm probably done in the computer
        industry," formed a kernel of a question in the back of my mind:
        nothing solid yet, but the crystal had been seeded.</p>
<p class="docText">Meanwhile, our legal battle was slowly sliding away. We had
        settled with two, then three of the major labels, but things weren't
        looking good for the remaining ones. Blame was placed on the judge
        involved, optimistic rhetoric abounded in the weekly chats, but Robin
        seemed a bit wearier, and some people were tuning out. Or were they?
        It's really hard to tell what the general mindset was, as people were
        still busy and there was still more than enough work to do. The big
        difference was that the buzz seemed to be gone. People didn't seem to
        be clamoring to work on projects: they did their jobs. They were still
        working 60- to 80-hour weeks, but it was to keep up, not to break new
        ground.</p>
<p class="docText">The <a name="idx-CHP-7-0192"></a>final shift in mindset for me occurred over the course
        of a quick-turnaround, four-week race-to-market project where we built
        our first subscription service. It was an adrenaline rush to work on
        (I'm a big fan of Get-It-Done, compressed-timeline projects), but
        miscommunication between the QA department and the infrastructure
        department (that would be me) killed me. It seemed like two or three
        days a week I would fire off an email at 4:30 a.m. saying, "Here's
        what I've done. Here's what should work. Here's what doesn't work. I'm
        going home and going to bed. I'll be in at 10:00 a.m.," only to get a
        phone call three hours later from my manager saying that something
        didn't work. There are two problems with this: (a) I was working my
        ass off to try to get this thing to work, and calling me at 8:00 a.m.
        is not going to solve the problem, and (b), as often as not, QA had
        not read my email and were complaining about something which I had
        stated <span class="docEmphasis">did not work</span>. Ugh.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't blame my manager. I know that she was getting it from
        the VP, who was hearing it from the director of QA that our stuff
        didn't work. <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-7-FNOTE-9">[]</a></sup> The problem was that I was starting to have nightmares
        about my cell phone ringing and I felt like I was putting my heart and
        soul into this project and getting no respect for doing so. Not long
        after the project went live (according to
        schedule), I tuned out. Sure, I got a nice set of
        (not-quite-worthless) stock options for my hard work, but that
        couldn't give me back my state of mind or make me feel like I would be
        respected for working hard. I was done.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-7-FNOTE-9">[]</a></sup> In all honesty, Janet was a great manager in that she
            protected her staff and totally went to bat for us, which was
            awesome. She also didn't take any guff and would come straight to
            you to &#8230; make sure everything was going to get done right and to
            ensure that you had the correct "sense of urgency" that some of
            the engineers didn't always appear to have. Ahem. Unfortunately,
            while I can understand this latter management style,
            <span class="docEmphasis">I</span> chafed at it a bit as I'm pretty sure it's
            going to take me longer to accomplish a task with someone
            literally looking over my shoulder.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">I kept working at <a name="idx-CHP-7-0193"></a>MP3.com for another year, and after a while, things got
        better: one of the VPs&mdash;Dan O'Neill&mdash;took me under his wing and worked
        with me to start performing again. It was a big deal that he took the
        time and energy, and it worked to a certain extent. I was getting work
        done and getting code written, but my heart still wasn't in it. I was
        working 40&ndash;50 hours a week, and that's really not up to snuff in that
        environment. A day after the planes hit the Twin Towers, I was
        gone.</p>
