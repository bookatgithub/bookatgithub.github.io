<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">SOME OF THE HARDEST
      PROBLEMS YOU DEAL WITH WHEN BUILDING SOFTWARE ARE THINGS YOU
      CAN'T</span> control. Sometimes accidents take down your project.
      Sometimes unforeseen issues do. And unfortunately, sometimes things are
      done to the team on purpose to undermine a project. Building software is
      hard enough without dealing with obstacles that are put in the team's
      way. But we work in the real world, and real-world projects run into
      problems that are bigger than the team and the software.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the biggest obstacles is a bad manager.</p>
<p class="docText">Have you ever had a manager who refused to accept a reasonable
      estimate? Or who consistently undersold your efforts ("The team says
      it'll take six weeks? I'll promise it in four; that'll light a fire
      under their asses!") and makes you work weekends to meet the crazy
      expectations? Bad managers come in all sorts of flavors, and every one
      of them presents a serious, sometimes even insurmountable, obstacle to
      the team. Some managers seem bound and determined to make your project
      fail. They micromanage the team, constantly change the goals of the
      project, and always seem to be made of Teflon when things go wrong,
      blaming the team for the problems and never questioning, even for a
      minute, their own direction or management.</p>
<p class="docText">A bad manager can be impossible to work for. But a team that's got
      a bad manager does have options. Sometimes it starts with recognizing
      that the manager is working against the team, and working around him.
      Sometimes you can actually change a bad manager: if you can gain a
      manager's trust, and get him to have confidence in the team, those
      things can work themselves out. Either way, the first step is
      recognizing the obstacle and figuring out how to handle it.</p>
<p class="docText">Not all obstacles are managers, or even people. Sometimes an
      obstacle is as simple as a technical constraint: having to work with
      terribly old hardware, having to make the software backward-compatible,
      unexpected and serious performance problems, or impenetrable spaghetti
      code that's difficult to maintain.</p>
<p class="docText">Some problems are an unavoidable result of the environment the
      team is working in. It could be a problem with the facility or the
      building. Some teams have to cope with time zone issues, when they're
      divided into groups across the world from each other. There are weather
      problems, traffic problems, transportation issues, noise problems &#8230; all
      sorts of obstacles that the team simply can't avoid.</p>
<p class="docText">Any of these problems can sink a project. But if you have a team
      that trusts each other and works well together, they can overcome even
      the craziest, most seemingly insurmountable obstacles in their way. In
      fact, getting past a serious problem can bring a team together. After
      all, you're all in it together. If you've got a serious problem that
      affects everyone on the team, then you'll all have to work together to
      get past it. And once you do, you've all got a shared experience that
      bonds the group tighter&mdash;much more than any cheesy corporate
      team-building retreat exercise ever could. In a lot of ways, it's
      adversity that makes a team gel.</p>
<p class="docText">Obstacles are hard for people to talk about.
      They're painful to go through, and not much fun to think about. And more
      often than not, serious obstacles really do cause projects to fail. If
      you open any software engineering textbook, you can read about all sorts
      of statistics and studies about project failure. (Some textbooks put
      this number at a staggering 80%!) But how many people have you talked to
      who really spend any time talking about their own failed
      projects?</p>
<p class="docText">It's human nature to avoid talking about our own failures. Most
      people's resumes highlight the successes, and try to find a silver
      lining in a project that failed. Few (if any) people ever see their own
      work life or careers in terms of failed projects, and certainly nobody
      will ever cast his own career as a series of failures, one after
      another. But if 80% (or even half that number) of projects really do
      fail, then our resumes and our lives should be littered with
      them.</p>
<p class="docText">And, in fact, when we've gone around to actual teams and talked to
      them about their own projects, that's exactly what we've found. There
      really are a huge number of failed projects: projects that went woefully
      over budget or came in very late, projects that built unusable software
      that the users rejected, projects that were so behind schedule that the
      problem they were built to solve substantially changed, and projects
      that simply failed to deliver anything at all. In fact, we've given many
      talks over the years about project failure, and at each of those talks,
      we ask the audience, "Is there anyone here who hasn't been on at least
      one failed project?" We've never seen a single hand go up.</p>
<p class="docText">The stories in this section are about teams overcoming all kinds
      of problems. There are stories that deal with good people facing
      difficult companies, awful managers, serious technical problems, and
      true evil. Some of them are preventable, frustrating, and insidious.
      Some of them are simply heartbreaking and utterly unavoidable. In every
      case, the obstacles had a profound effect on the team: on how they
      worked together, and on how (or whether) they got past it. But in every
      case, there's an important lesson to be learned, and people who were
      made stronger for the experience, even when they outlasted the team
      itself.</p>
