<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">IN AUGUST 1998, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL IN
        RESPONSE TO A RESUME I HAD POSTED ON AN ONLINE</span> employment
        website. I didn't think much of the contact at the time, but then I've
        failed to recognize all the major turning points in my life. A quick
        reply with my phone number led to a return call from the
        founder/president/CEO of the company. I could not predict that I was
        just days away from joining an extended train wreck of a company and
        becoming part of the most improbably great team I have ever known. The
        sum of my formal education was going to be dwarfed in comparison to
        what I would learn over the next six years.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, my words can have an uncanny habit of coming back to haunt
        me, and this story is definitely no exception. It would be convenient
        to claim that everything that follows is a work of fiction, but I'm
        not that good at making things up. I might also like to rely on my
        admittedly poor memory as a possible defense. But I had a great deal
        of help with the story from my once former and now again current
        coworker Stan Granite. His humor, his unique
        perspective, and his superior recall (often supplied with supporting
        text from his email archives) helped make the story far too accurate.
        He was also responsible for coining many of the nicknames that became
        part of the company lore. In most cases, I've used those names to
        cover my ass, along with a few additional substitutions of my own when
        I deemed it necessary. Unfortunately, the guilty will still recognize
        who they are. I know words can hurt, so I can only hope that when they
        read this and think back, they will laugh as much as I have and have
        mercy on me.</p>
<p class="docText">Upward of 160 different people worked for the company during the
        six years I was there. Headcount ranged from a low of six or seven
        when I was hired to a watermark of 42. Turnover was remarkably high,
        when you excluded the development team, who our CEO grudgingly
        acknowledged as a necessary and indispensable evil. But when any cash
        was available, it was soon lavished on a host of VPs and directors,
        often of dubious pedigree and even more dubious strategic purpose.
        When times were tight, they were the first to be shown the door,
        generally with little ceremony. But, through thick and thin, the core
        development team remained surprisingly stable. Starting from nothing,
        a core of eight developers produced a product with a Windows client
        comprising nearly 800 screens, totaling 700,000 lines of code, and a
        database tier consisting of 750 tables and 800 stored procedures
        containing 400,000 lines of T-SQL. All of this was developed while
        simultaneously delivering a score of custom projects, which were
        needed to help keep the lights on. I was too na&iuml;ve at the time to
        appreciate how impressive a feat this was. We were all too na&iuml;ve, and
        this was probably the key to our success. Anyone with some sense would
        have quickly understood that even our best efforts were no match for a
        string of comically poor decisions by management and the criminally
        bad behavior of our customers that resulted. In my defense, I had
        assumed anyone with the courage to risk his own money and that of his
        investors would be someone who was sure he had a winning strategy. My
        assumption was right, but I failed to consider that the same person
        could also be perfectly delusional. But then, I had never met anyone
        like Hedley Lamarr.</p>
<p class="docText">I met Hedley in an office building in downtown Pittsburgh. I
        remember our first meeting clearly, only because it was exactly what I
        expected. He was smartly dressed in suit and tie, was well spoken, and
        had a respectable office with a nice view. Hedley described <a name="idx-CHP-28-0869"></a>Rock Ridge as a bespoke software shop, specializing in
        the energy industry. He seemed to clearly enjoy being a businessman
        that day. An hour or so later, I left smiling, convinced that I had
        delivered another commanding interview performance. A phone call
        confirmed it, and after some quick salary negotiation (20% over the
        first offer), I was hired. "Finally, a real job." Previously, I had
        worked in a few Mickey Mouse operations during school, spent a few
        months at a crooked dot-com hopeful that was run by the insane, and
        most recently was a poorly paid independent consultant. I wasn't
        looking forward to the dress code (shirt and tie), the start time
        (8:30 a.m.), or the commute, but I was happy to put all that silliness
        behind me and begin my career in earnest.</p>
<p class="docText">My new job enthusiasm quickly wore off. My few coworkers were
        odd, but uninspiring; I made a mental note to continue ignoring them.
        A busy hallway door opened without warning almost directly into my
        cube. Possibly worse was the diabolically bad coffee. I also
        didn't see much of Hedley again. What little
        direction I received was in intense but brief conversations from a
        harried (and hairy) software development manager, later <a name="idx-CHP-28-0870"></a>to be dubbed C$. My task, I gathered, was to design the
        UI and application framework for a new project, a VB and Microsoft SQL
        Server-based utility billing system. I didn't have the experience to
        question the project's lack of any real requirements, specifications,
        or processes. So, when I wasn't exploring the limits of how much I
        could goof off, I made up the design as I went along. Two weeks later,
        I was introduced to another new hire in the next cube, Stan Granite. I
        was only beginning to take in what I was seeing as I reached out to
        shake his hand. This guy was completely out of proportion with
        everything in the office. He was a giant. He did not look comfortable
        in a shirt and tie, and looked especially uncomfortable in his tiny
        cube, which might now be doubling as a veal pen. When his junk heap of
        a computer immediately gave him trouble, I guessed it wouldn't be long
        'til I heard "Hulk SMASH!" or words to that effect&#8230;. I began to
        consider my escape route. But what I really wondered was, "What in the
        hell was this guy doing here?" Stan apparently was wondering something
        similar. I asked him about his first impressions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">Even though our team eventually became close, it took a while
          to reach that point. There's an old saw about marriage that states
          that the traits that you thought were charming before you got
          married are the ones that drive you crazy later on. For me, it was
          exactly the opposite in regard to our team: the traits that
          eventually provided us with hours of entertainment were those that
          initially made me wonder if I'd last three months.</p>
<p class="docText">When I first started working at Oxford Center, there were six
          or eight of us packed in a cube arrangement that looked like an ice
          cube tray and which wasn't much bigger than one. I received about
          three minutes of instruction and was given a PC that was out of
          service more than in service&mdash;facts that were dismissed when I was
          berated by C$ at the end of my first week, which concluded with the
          line, "I'm not even sure why I'm paying you."</p>
<p class="docText">I barely interacted with Hedley until we started working on
          the VPC version of Candygram, so my first memory of him is a 10x
          scale customer invoice, drawn with more detail than a Hieronymus
          Bosch painting. Nearly a thousand square inches focused entirely on
          layout, without any context given to the data. I mean, who mocks up
          a bill with a marker on an easel pad and feels the need to draw an
          accurately scaled, fully scannable PostNet bar code and account
          numbers rendered in MICR font? I think that if he'd written "bar
          code goes here," we'd have gotten the idea. If I were more
          perceptive, all of that exquisite layout detail with no substance to
          speak of would have given me some early insight into his
          personality.</p>
<p class="docText">And then there were my teammates: Friar Tuck is exactly the
          opposite of C$ as far as first impressions and lasting outcomes.
          Initially my impression was positive. He at least acknowledged my
          presence, which is more than I can say for The Mad Shitter (TMS),
          who appeared to be a modern-day Harpo Marx, or Rain Man (the guy
          that ritually arranged all of his pens, markers, and pencils on his
          desk, by type and size, making sure they were in perfect alignment
          before leaving each night). But after spending half an hour trying
          to help Friar Tuck remember the name of this amazing new restaurant
          he found (we finally determined it was Chick-fil-A), I got
          suspicious. It didn't take me long to figure
          out that he had all of the prodigious computer programming prowess
          and well-honed powers of logical thought I'd expect from a
          [decidedly non-technical subject] major.</p>
<p class="docText">Mark was prone to making seriously controversial statements.
          Like&#8230;murdering babies wasn't nearly as serious as murdering adults.
          He'd explain, "It only takes two years to replace a two-year-old. I
          represent 25 years of investment, and I'm at the beginning of my
          economic prime." And when he wasn't on my ass, C$ had a habit of
          ceaselessly reminding everyone that they had no talent compared to
          him [by any measure]. I had not yet learned to appreciate the
          entertainment value of their antics.</p>
<p class="docText">I think the turning point with C$ happened one night when we
          were working late. He was regaling me with tales of how powerful his
          brain was. C$ explained that he had four brain quadrants, each
          capable of working independently to solve the world's problems. One
          quadrant must've realized he was hungry, and he proceeded to leave
          to get something to eat. But not before he pointed in the general
          direction of his head, saying, "This thing needs a lot of fuel to
          keep it going." I replied, "C$, I couldn't tell: were you pointing
          at your brain or your mouth?" It was the first time we'd ever seen
          C$ speechless. Granted, it lasted only a few seconds, but it seemed
          to me that after I made that comment, he started treating me less
          like a minion and more like a peer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Somehow we all survived the following month and a half to see
        the opening of the Software Development Center in the heart of
        Pittsburgh's South Side. Probably 50 bars and restaurants were now
        within a 10-minute walk of the office. Hedley was happy that the
        technical staff (the help)&mdash;below Hedley's standards, even with the
        help of the dress code&mdash;were no longer disrupting the professional
        image he was trying to project in the downtown office. But he still
        had his concerns. Stan writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">Most of the developers were in their 20s and male, so Hedley
          thought that we needed supervision, and he appointed a woman a
          decade or two older to keep us in line. Her sole contribution during
          her brief tenure at <a name="idx-CHP-28-0871"></a>Rock Ridge was to institute a "whereabouts board," and
          she instructed us that each person was supposed to indicate his or
          her whereabouts and estimated time of return if they were not in the
          office. If someone was going to run downstairs to get a bagel from
          the bagel shop, it was supposed to be noted on the board. The
          whereabouts board was a contributor to team unity in that it was
          nearly universally reviled by the core team members. The fact that
          Mark completely disregarded the board, as did I, was probably my
          first sign that he was OK. Well, that and the fact that his lunch
          would occasionally consist of only a 10-fluid-ounce gimlet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Mark's note: to potential prospective employers,
        voters, or members of the jury&#8230;I'd like to clarify that when I
        complemented his recall, I was not suggesting that Stan's memory was
        100% accurate</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Stan's note: Mark is correct&#8230;on occasion, the gimlets
        might have been as small as 8 oz</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">With two offices, the company now got together only for special
        occasions (like Christmas, happy hours, and the periodic mass layoff).
        When the first happy hour found us all at Dingbats in town, the
        company was up to about 15 or 20 people.</p>
<a name="editors_note_the_authors_put_us_in_touch"></a><p><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Editors' note: the authors put
          us in touch with Stan Granite. Andrew interviewed Mark and Stan, who
          filled in some of the more interesting details of the
          story</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, I have two questions. One, how did you
          end up developing so much working code with such a small team? And
          two, why did you guys stick around to do it? It seemed like a kind
          of difficult environment to work in, even after the move to the
          South Side. It sounds like you had some real challenges. But you put
          out an enormous amount of code, and from what I understand, it
          actually worked</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: Let me answer those
          two questions as succinctly as I can; maybe we can flush them out.
          One, we built everything that we did because we worked like beavers
          on meth. And two, the team stayed together because every day was
          like going to work with an improvisational comedy troupe. I mean,
          you had to be on your game, and that was fun. If you said the wrong
          thing, man, you were getting crushed.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: But working like demons isn't enough. I've
          been on teams where we worked like demons, and basically produced
          nothing of value. In fact, what I've seen in the past is that for
          some teams, the harder they worked the less they produced, because
          they spent most of their time ripping things out that they'd built
          last-minute in a panic and that didn't actually work. You guys, on
          the other hand, got something out the door that's used now every day
          by a major energy company to manage their core business, and it
          works well enough that it's become critical to their operation. So,
          it's got to be more than working like demons. I want to try to
          figure out what that "more than that" was</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: I think part of it is
          that we didn't have a lot of overlapping or competing skills, so our
          ego problems didn't descend down to the code level. Or, maybe, there
          was one person, C$, whose ego was so enormous that it couldn't be
          subverted, so we had some consistency there.</p>
<p class="docText">But I don't think there were too many conflicts when it came
          to figuring out what to do. I think we had the right ratio of people
          that were there to get the work done, and enough people looking a
          little bit ahead who would say, "This sucks, and we need to do this
          better. If we don't, this will hurt." So, I guess we had some
          sensitivity to pain.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: But the thing about
          ego that you said&mdash;it really didn't extend to the code. Even C$,
          while proclaiming that he was the world's greatest SQL programmer on
          the East Coast, could face it. He took a lot of flak for the hidden
          text box thing after the fact.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What was the hidden text box
          thing?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: So, when we started
          developing Candygram, there was a previously existing version,
          version 2.5. (We'll talk about that later with the Turducken story.)
          Candygram 2.5 was a Visual Basic 4.0 application. Mark and I started
          looking at the code, and we saw these hidden text boxes used to
          store state all over the place. We were immediately all over C$,
          making fun of him&mdash;"Are you unaware of the form-level
          variable?"&mdash;which, of course, irritated the crap out of him. We
          obviously had to do a bit of code cleanup there. He always claimed
          that was how you had to do it in Access 2.0, where there was some
          bug that if you used a variable it'd lose its
          state under certain conditions, and that got carried forward.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: I think he was just
          being lazy by using a hidden text box with the built-in data
          binding, because otherwise he'd have to write a line or two of
          code.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: Everybody was open to
          listening to new stuff. We occasionally would have design sessions
          where somebody would get pissed, but everybody would just shake it
          off. Even if people didn't admit it, they learned a lot from working
          collaboratively.</p>
<p class="docText">It was getting rid of Friar Tuck that actually allowed that to
          happen. He was the one that was holding us back.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: I think that's
          probably pretty important. There were no bad apples when we were at
          our peak. Friar Tuck, on the other hand, was a jackass. He was the
          kind of person who sucked the life out of the projects he was on,
          because he did things poorly. You ended up having to do more work
          when that guy was around, because not only did he mess up your work,
          you also had to fix <span class="docEmphasis">his</span> work. He made you think
          he was working on things that were worthwhile, until it was time to
          get it out the door and you realized that you had to backfill
          everything he did. And then you'd be punished later because you had
          to maintain his terrible designs.</p>
<p class="docText">Once we got rid of him, and one or two other people who were
          marginal at the time, you were working with people who you genuinely
          respected. Each person had their own area where they were competent
          and even talented. Nobody was such a jackass that you were
          demotivated by it. Once we got rid of the bad apples, you kind of
          felt guilty if you weren't getting a lot of work done, because you
          could look around and see that everyone else was busting ass and
          doing what they had to do, so you'd do it, too.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: There's a famous
          story that C$ still references every now and then. Early in the
          Candygram project, C$ had a meeting to talk about code and the
          standards everyone had to follow. People made their arguments for
          doing this or that, then C$ made a decision and that was the
          standard going forward. There were a handful of items&mdash;seven, eight
          items&mdash;on the agenda. Mark and I were arguing for the right way to do
          it, and Friar Tuck was on the other side of virtually all of the
          decisions. So, we have this meeting, and C$ basically ruled on all
          eight items in our favor, because it was basically Code Complete
          kind of stuff that nobody in their right mind would argue with,
          except for Friar Tuck. Tuck basically evaluated every technique in
          terms of how little typing it would require; that was his primary
          motivator. He's a big fan of whatever syntactic hacks required the
          fewest keystrokes.</p>
<p class="docText">So, we had this meeting, talking about how we wanted to
          approach these things and what our standards would be. C$ was always
          big on code standards. If he has a strongest point, that would be
          it&mdash;he always hated people doing things in eight different ways
          because that made it hard to maintain. It was probably close to a
          two-hour meeting that we addressed this. So we get to the end, and
          C$ asks if anyone wants to talk about anything else. And Tuck gets
          up and says, "I don't like the scent that we have in the bathroom. I
          don't like the spray that's in there. It's a berry scent, and I
          don't like that." And C$ turned bright red.</p>
<p class="docText">He said, "Look, we bought that with our
          own money. It was all the store had. Is there anything
          <span class="docEmphasis">real</span> that anyone has to bring up?" That was
          Friar Tuck in a nutshell.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And getting rid of him?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: That was when things
          started to get interesting.</p>
