          support, or who repeatedly does things that require you to work
          harder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Succubus had at least two previous failed
        CIS replacement projects before the Candygram project started, which
        should attest to some of the difficulties its business partners and
        suppliers faced. Also, as a long-established and regulated utility, it
        had a culture that had been warped by the long exposure to the
        perverse incentives resulting from the intersection of business,
        government, and labor. Standard operating procedures included
        adversarial negotiation, maximizing gains within existing legal
        agreements, and cost containment. The legal department had a great
        deal of influence within the company, and they were never hesitant to
        take a matter to court.</p>
<p class="docText">Their approach left a business like ours that operated
        informally and with small cash reserves at their mercy. Unfortunately,
        the lure of a big payoff at the end meant that ownership was willing
        to submit.</p>
<p class="docText">The abusive cycle started with THE SLOW PAY, which turned into
        THE BLACKMAILER scenario when payment became overdue. Multiple change
        orders containing substantial free work would be agreed to in exchange
        for prompt payment of outstanding invoices. This would be followed by
        THE SOMETHING-FOR-NOTHING angle, in which scope would be added as the
        acceptance criteria would be "clarified."</p>
<p class="docText">THE FLAKE maneuver was also a favorite tactic. Project
        specification negotiations would drag on, in one instance six weeks
        past the desired project start date. The only non-negotiable point was
        the delivery date, which did not change. It was also a common
        occurrence for key Succubus people to be consistently unavailable when
        they were required. Their delay was solely our problem.</p>
<p class="docText">I'm reluctant to imply that there was a regular pattern of
        duplicitous behavior. But, there was one notable example of THE LIAR
        behavior involving a high-ranking member of the project team. One
        might speculate that other similarly underhanded incidents occurred
        without detection. This particular incident involved the primary
        analyst/developer of the existing mainframe system; let's call him R.
        By most accounts, R was the most knowledgeable person in Succubus
        about the existing CIS system. Not just on merit, but also because R
        jealously hoarded this information for his personal gain. Even his
        employer was at his mercy. If they wanted features or logic added to
        their system, you had to make it worth R's time. R understood the
        threat of any new system, and took a key role on the project to
        neutralize this threat. His role made him the judge and jury over new
        Candygram functionality. Just how far he was willing to go was seen
        firsthand by our project manager, PButt, who was helping with testing
        on-site. That day, they were testing a fairly complicated financial
        calculation that could be controlled by several configurable
        parameters. R caused a great deal of commotion, pointing out that
        calculations were wrong when a particular configuration parameter was
        enabled. What he didn't know was that PButt, knowing that this
        calculation was a high-priority item, had tested the functionality
        himself before releasing it to Succubus. He demanded evidence of the
        problem from an on-the-spot test run. R ran the calculation and
        provided the damning evidence. After confirming it worked on his test
        system, PButt created a new test scenario in the production system. R
        again ran the test, and again produced data showing we remained in
        error, and pronounced the software a failure. On a hunch, PButt
        checked the system's auditing tables, which
        recorded configuration changes. These tables were created to aid our
        testing and support efforts, and were not part of the advertised
        system functionality. User and timestamp data showed that preceding
        each test run R had turned the config parameter OFF, reenabling it
        once his evidence had been produced. Confronted with the audit tables,
        R impishly admitted, "Oh yeah, I guess I was doing that." A fistfight
        was narrowly averted, but untold damage had already been done. PButt
        was later able to recount this tale during R's lawsuit claiming
        wrongful termination.</p>
<p class="docText">THE CLINGER behavior became more and more obvious as the "go
        live" date asymptotically approached. Near the end, roughly 40% of our
        company personnel were working on-site full-time. We didn't protest
        too much, as they were technically billable hours, but the payment
        games being played meant this much-needed revenue was never
        seen.</p>
<p class="docText">There can be little doubt that Succubus was a classic MONEY PIT
        customer. Without the reserves to absorb the abuses, we were forced to
        the brink of bankruptcy twice during the project, each time being
        forced to lay off nearly half of the work force.</p>

<p class="docText">From: Hedley Lamarr
          <a class="docLink" href="mailto:hlamarr@rockridge.com">hlamarr@rockridge.com</a></p>
<p class="docText">To: Personnel</p>
<p class="docText">Subject: Candygram System Enhancement Project for
          Succubus</p>
<p class="docText">As a company, we have an incentive to deliver prior to January
          25th in the form of a cash bonus&#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">I believe that if we meet the December 7th deadline with a
          product that is defect-free, we stand a very good chance of actually
          receiving some of that incentive bonus."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">It was even obvious to Hedley that the payment was not something
        to count on, especially considering the impossibly high hurdle of
        "defect-free" software. Still, we limped on.</p>
<p class="docText">In late July 2004, having failed to land a deal for the largest
        natural gas company in Pakistan (a fanciful reach by even the most
        optimistic standards), we were facing our most dire cash crunch. The
        triumvirate (Hedley, PButt, and a reluctant C$) agreed to a
        two-pronged approach to the problem: 1) immediately initiate yet
        another layoff, and 2) a proposal to sell the source code to Succubus
        <span class="docEmphasis">and</span> to waive the employment contracts of any
        remaining <a name="idx-CHP-28-0891"></a>Rock Ridge employees identified as necessary to continue
        the project internally at Succubus. Those employees selected for the
        layoff revealed Hedley's thinking.</p>
<p class="docText">They included the only employee devoting significant time to
        quality assurance testing, and Stan, the client-side developer with
        arguably the best understanding of the system, and who in six years
        had unarguably logged the most overtime. Adding insult to injury, his
        reprieve came from Succubus, which expressed interest in signing him.
        Those who were kept included two employees hired in the previous six
        months. They lacked knowledge of the system or of our existing
        customers, but they had the superficial qualities of the kind of
        employee Hedley wanted to hire. S, an implementation analyst, looked
        and talked like a businessperson. He dressed in dress slacks and
        long-sleeved name-brand shirts. More importantly, he sounded right to
        Hedley. He used the sort of buzzwords that were en vogue
        at the time. He did have a considerable CV, but lacking the ability to
        generate short-term revenue, his potential was irrelevant. The other
        employee was of even more demonstrably poor value. Although Pong
        claimed a right to the title "senior developer," what little code he
        did produce needed to be reworked or scrapped. Worse, in the course of
        his efforts, he was a productivity leech, relying on a revolving
        selection of team members for easily sourced information. What he did
        have was an ability to unflinchingly spout the world-class bullshit
        Hedley was desperate to hear. Hedley had had his fill of
        reality.</p>
<p class="docText">Some of Pong's finest work can be seen in <a name="idx-CHP-28-0892"></a>Rock Ridge's Quality Assurance procedures contained in a
        system RFP. The reality was that the minimal QA procedures we did have
        were now the sole domain of a part-time employee who had no formal
        training. But in Pong's contribution to the proposal, the truth is
        stretched to imply that we were clearly at the forefront of our
        industry, with enough weasel words to stop short of outright lying.
        This was something Hedley could relate to.</p>

<p class="docList">The foundation of <a name="idx-CHP-28-0893"></a>Rock Ridge's quality assurance begins with nearly
              all of our technical staff having an excellent foundation in
              Computer Science and/or Software Engineering. There is also a
              significant influence from Carnegie Mellon University and the
              Software Engineering Institute, as a number of our staff are
              Carnegie Mellon graduates. The significance is the nearly
              universal awareness through out the technical portion of the
              organization of the Software Capability Maturity Model and
              metric based repeatable software development processes derived
              from it.</p>

<p class="docList">Three members of the technical team had ties to Carnegie
              Mellon. One left after posting a cumulative GPA &lt; 1 in a
              non-CS major, but before being formally asked to leave. The
              second was formally asked to leave, but later returned, barely
              graduating, again in a non-CS major, while the third was married
              to someone who worked for the SEI, but had left the company a
              few years later. Additionally, several of our staff understands
              the CMM well enough to know how laughably bad our practices
              really are, by almost any metric, with one being so inspired by
              the disparity as to write a book on software project
              management.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">By the end of summer 2004, the deal for the code and employees
        was nearly finalized. Hedley requested a meeting with each developer.
        The meeting's goal depended on your fate. If Hedley hoped you would
        remain a Rock Ridge employee, the meeting was to sell you on his
        vision for the newly reinvigorated company. If you were on Succubus's
        list, the meeting was somewhat more complicated. The deal was
        conditional on at least two of the named chattel to accept an offer of
        employment from Succubus. He desperately needed to convince those on
        the list to agree. But the years of dealing with Succubus left a
        bitter taste in his mouth. He made the pitch, but not without
        suggesting in a roundabout and hopefully legally defensible way that
        you might also abandon Succubus as soon as you were able. Never seeing
        a back he didn't feel like stabbing, he had already provided, without
        any consent, all relevant HR records (including salary), effectively
        destroying any bargaining power those employees might have had.</p>
<p class="docText">Having the luck of being one of the first
        people hired meant I started with a choice assignment: building the
        Candygram client framework. By completion, everyone was fully
        committed with project work, which meant I would be the only one
        available for the next choice assignment. Rarely having significant
        involvement in the business logic, I was off Succubus's radar. It also
        meant I had a hand, sometimes more, in nearly everything, including
        the mail and network infrastructure. So it wasn't much of a surprise,
        when I was the last to be scheduled, and when Hedley gave me his best
        sales pitch to stay. I was offered the position of CTO. In a second,
        maybe two, my emotions ran from joy, to pride, to doubt, to loathing,
        before settling on a m&eacute;lange of despair and resentment. I was being
        offered the captain's hat on a visibly sinking ship. That's also when
        I realized that the SME mentioned in a footnote of the business plan
        was me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-28-0894"></a>Rock Ridge will depute an SME to Gurgaon, India to
          carry out the knowledge transition. The duration for this is
          expected to be 3-4 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">We were going to offshore development. One of our
        longest-running jokes involved our eventual Indian replacements. I
        wasn't offended by the prospect of my teammates being replaced by
        cheaper labor. I just couldn't comprehend how, after the lessons of
        the previous six years, he expected our salvation would be an unknown
        offshore team, billable on an hourly basis, who was not directly
        accountable to our company and who had no knowledge of, or loyalty to,
        our product. My email after the meeting:</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="docText">At least I merited 30 minutes of his time for an individual
        meeting. Realizing that Hedley seemed to be having a hard time making
        room for their individual meetings (his three-week vacation in Europe
        having something to do with it) Stan, TMS, and Tubman proposed a group
        meeting. He agreed, and it meant that they would have the unique
        opportunity to hear both pitches. Hedley first gave the stay pitch.
        "TMS, you've worked for me for nearly a decade. We've stood together
        with you for that long, and we're not going to stop now. I want you to
        know that you'll always have a place at Rock Ridge as long as I'm
        running the company." He then turned to Tubman. "Tubman, I really
        appreciate what you've done for the company. The Cash Drawer project
        has really been a big help to our bottom line, and I want you to know
        that if the Succubus deal falls through, you'll be a part of any Plan
        B that might come about." Finally, Hedley appeared ready to give the
        same pitch to Stan Granite. With the Succubus deal still
        unconsummated, Hedley got right to the point: "Stan, you'll be off the
        payroll August 31st." Without a moment's hesitation, he then broke
        into his standard, "The future looks bright, the sales pipeline has
        never been stronger, and if we pull together as a
        team" speech that he'd given a thousand times before.</p>
<p class="docText">And thus ended an era.</p>
