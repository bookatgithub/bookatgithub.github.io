<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">WHEN WE STARTED
      WORKING ON <span class="docEmphasis">BEAUTIFUL TEAMS</span> BACK IN LATE 2007, WE
      THOUGHT WE HAD A</span> pretty good idea of where the book would go.
      We're techie people: we've implemented lots of practices, done lots of
      software projects, and seen things get better over time as we did it.
      We've seen our own teams improve, we've learned from our mistakes over
      time, and we thought we had a handle on what makes a team work.</p>
<p class="docText">So, we thought we'd sit down with a bunch of people who felt the
      way we did, write down some insightful tricks of the trade and pearls of
      wisdom, and everyone would be happy.</p>
<p class="docText">As it turns out, we were in for a surprise.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, we weren't exactly wrong or even misguided when we started
      working on this project. Results do speak for themselves, and we'd
      gotten good results. One of the things that made us feel quite confident
      about our reasonably complete understanding of what makes a good team
      work is that we'd read plenty other people who agreed with us.</p>
<p class="docText">One thing that we both agreed on when we started this project was
      that a good team has to have a focus on the technical skills of the
      people on the team. So, when we started recruiting authors and looking
      through their writing, we expected a lot of stories about how to make
      sure your team is technically capable: recruiting and hiring the right
      people, finding the right practices (like writing specs or doing code
      reviews) and training people on them, and generally helping people who
      already show talent and promise to develop their skills to become better
      programmers.</p>
<p class="docText">It didn't exactly work out like that. In fact, there's very little
      talk throughout the whole book about training people, improving their
      skills, or being very selective about your team members.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, let's be clear here. Nobody said that wasn't important. In
      fact, just the opposite seems to be true: all of our contributors seemed
      to assume that a good team starts out with at least a kernel of skilled
      people with the right training, background, and attitude for the job. It
      seemed obvious to everyone that if you have people who are incapable of
      doing the job, the team and the project will clearly fail. But what
      surprised us was that rather than being the ultimate goal, getting the
      right skills for the team was really more of a starting point to build
      on.</p>
<p class="docText">The truth, as it turns out, is a lot more complicated than we
      realized at first. It has more to do with things that are a lot harder
      to quantify. Sometimes the best people on the team aren't always the
      most technically skilled, and sometimes the most technically skilled
      people on the team can actually be detrimental to getting the work done.
      People need to be able to work together, and if they can't, it doesn't
      matter how good their skills are. In fact, some of the best programmers
      (from a technical perspective) are in danger of getting too cocky, and
      can actually make it more difficult to get the project done. But those
      are often the most important people on your team.</p>
<p class="docText">We were starting to get a little nervous. We
      were used to seeing the world in black and white: either you have a team
      of the best people (the smartest, most technically skilled, capable
      developers, testers, architects, etc.) who can do the job best, or you
      have a less-than-perfect team and you have to deal with it. But what we
      found is that <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> teams are less-than-perfect. Even
      the ones that are full of highly skilled, top-notch people can have
      serious problems that can cause the code to suffer. And
      <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> teams have some drama. Even if they produce
      something solid and amazing, they all have to overcome the same
      challenges that come with people working with other people.</p>
<p class="docText">Once we realized that, we started looking back through our own
      careers, and our own teams. What we found was that our most successful
      teams really weren't always the ones with the best programmers. They
      were the ones where everyone worked really well together.</p>
<p class="docText">In the end, teams are made up of people, and people are the most
      important part of the equation. Sometimes we even fell into the trap of
      thinking that people with similar skills were somewhat interchangeable.
      If you treat building software as a bean-counting exercise, it's way too
      easy to think of people as resources to be assigned to tasks, and their
      work as effort hours to be expended; you could easily come to the
      conclusion that good people are just cogs in a machine, and that their
      technical skills are just attributes that can be measured or turned on
      with certifications, training classes, and experience hours.</p>
<p class="docText">As we worked with our authors and interviewees, we were reminded
      just how untrue that is. And, in fact, we realized that on a few
      occasions, both of us have fallen into the trap of thinking of our
      people as interchangeable cogs, and it inevitably led to our projects
      running into serious problems.</p>
<p class="docText">The stories and interviews in this section are the ones that
      reminded us of those important lessons. They're about what happens when
      people clash on teams, and what happens when they learn to work together
      well. Reading these stories and talking to these people, we learned that
      no team is a storybook team of brilliant engineers who work together
      perfectly and professionally 100% of the time.</p>
<p class="docText">More than that, the most influential people on
      your team aren't always the best programmers. In fact, they're not the
      managers or leaders, either. They're the people who are
      <span class="docEmphasis">genuine</span>: they're there to get the work done, and
      are able to be themselves while doing it. They listen to the people
      around them, and understand what motivates them and makes them tick. And
      it's not because they read a book or took a seminar on how to be a
      motivational leader. It's because they're considerate to the people
      around them. They take the time to make sure that everyone's on the same
      frequency&mdash;not necessarily nice or even helpful to each other, just
      compatible in a way that works for them. And they recognize when they
      simply can't work together (for whatever reason), and try to do
      something about it.</p>
<p class="docText">Teams are messy. They're full of emotional connections, often
      between people who are at their wits' end trying to solve problems that
      may not necessarily be solvable. When you have people who, in the midst
      of a situation like that, are willing to be themselves, put themselves
      on the line, listen to the people around them, and help everyone get
      through the late nights and the frustration, that's what makes a team
      great. Not necessarily <span class="docEmphasis">beautiful</span>, but effective and
      good to work on. Without those kinds of connections between people on
      the team, the job is just a job, and the team isn't one that everyone on
      it will remember for the rest of their lives.</p>
