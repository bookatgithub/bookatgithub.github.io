<p class="docText">Anyone who's followed the world of software development anytime
        after the late '90s has at least heard of the agile movement. One area
        that agile development overlaps with the work we've done over the
        years is in the practices used on agile projects&mdash;especially practices
        for <a name="idx-CHP-11-0275"></a>planning and estimation, and how that impacts teams and
        the software that they build. Mike Cohn has written books and spoken
        frequently on exactly this topic.</p>
</td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: We wanted to start out by
      asking you about your background. How did you come to know about the
      things you know about how teams work?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Well, I guess I got kind
      <a name="idx-CHP-11-0276"></a>of lucky in one of the first programming jobs I had. My
      boss didn't know what to do with us. He wasn't a manager of programmers
      at all, so he ended up putting me in charge, even though I didn't have a
      lot of experience doing that myself. I had a little bit more than the
      other developers that I was working with, as there were just four of us
      at the time. I just kind of ended up being a team lead there. From
      there, I ended up running various software development teams, and worked
      my way up to being a VP of engineering at a handful of companies. I got
      a lot of exposure to different types of companies from that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Through all of that experience, can you tell us
      specifically what characterized some of the better teams that you've
      been on, and if there's anything that they've had in
      common?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Normally what the better
      teams I've been on have really benefited from is having what's called a
      clear, <a name="idx-CHP-11-0277"></a>elevating goal. They had some sort of mission that they
      were after and that the team really focused on. When you have something
      like that, it gets rid of all of the other crap and politics and stuff
      that get in your way.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Have you ever felt like you understood the goal,
      but your team didn't quite get it? How did you get everybody in sync on
      the goal?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Well, a lot of times the
      team doesn't understand the goal right off. That's part of the project
      manager's job, or in agile it's part of the product owner's or
      ScrumMaster's job to help make sure the team understands what that goal
      is.</p>
<p class="docText">Going back to the importance of this, a lot of us have been in
      companies that have had the goal of "make a ton of money." That's not a
      very elevating goal. I'm looking for teams to have something that's a
      little more intrinsically valuable than that to pursue.</p>
<p class="docText">There's nothing wrong with making a ton of money, but that's not
      the type of thing that's going to pull a team together to really achieve
      spectacular things. Yes, they'll work hard because they think they're
      going to make a ton of money, but I'm looking for people to go beyond
      the productivity we get just from those types of motivations.</p>
<p class="docText">I'll give you one example. One of the companies I was at was a
      healthcare company. Essentially, we were the first company to put nurses
      on the telephone giving out medical advice. That's a very common thing
      these days, but back in the early '90s, it wasn't.</p>
<p class="docText">A lot of people in that company were there because they felt we
      were going to significantly improve people's lives. It would be
      great&mdash;you would be able to call a nurse rather than go to a doctor, and
      get medical advice right then.</p>
<p class="docText">We had some archetypal phone calls we wanted to support. One we
      used a lot was a young mother with a sick baby who can't get a hold of
      the doctor. She calls, talks to a nurse, and her mind is put at ease
      because she knows what to do for her baby.</p>
<p class="docText">What we wanted to do was make calls like this
      very tangible to people. We started putting out an email a day of a
      significant phone call that had happened the previous day. Some of those
      phone calls were lifesaving.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember one guy had called in with a question about whether he
      should go to his chiropractor or not. He'd hurt his back. He had pain in
      the left side of his back and really wasn't sure what to do about it.
      Should he go to a chiropractor? Should he just take some aspirin and
      wait? It turned out he was having a heart attack. Our nurse on the phone
      was able to diagnose that by using the software, plus her own nursing
      expertise. So she was able to figure this out and dispatch an ambulance
      to his house. She saved his life.</p>
<p class="docText">We started sending around the phone call of the day by email to
      team members to help them understand the impact that we were having. We
      did things like that to try to make a team understand why we were doing
      that project.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I can definitely see how that would be huge for
      the morale of the team and really pull people together as a group rather
      than just a bunch of individuals. I'm wondering: did that also have an
      effect on the quality of the software? Because it seems like it
      might</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: I guess that's a tough
      question. How do you ever do a double-blind study? Do you say, "Hey,
      you're not motivated today" and "Today you are" and compare?</p>
<p class="docText">I believe there's a direct correlation between a team with a
      clear, elevating goal and a team that writes high-quality code, lots of
      tests, and such.</p>
<p class="docText">The way I always say it is teams that go well go fast. If you
      write a bunch of high-quality code, you're going to go fast because
      there's not a lot of bugs dragging you down.</p>
<p class="docText">The teams that I've worked with that have had this type of clear,
      elevating goal as motivation certainly went fast. So, I'm assuming that
      we can draw the analogy they also must have been writing high-quality
      code to be able to do that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I really like the direct line you drew between
      getting the job done fast and getting the job done right or
      well</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: That's actually a really, really difficult point
      for a lot of people to comprehend right off the bat. It's something that
      takes a lot of experience for a lot of people to come
      to</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">I know that both Andrew and I have had a tough time
      getting that idea across to all different kinds of people, because when
      you talk about investing upfront in testing and in practices that are
      going to help people to write quality software, it seems like a lot of
      extra bureaucracy and a lot of extra time sometimes</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: A lot of programmers&mdash;and just not programmers,
      but managers, too&mdash;often have a lot of trouble connecting the dots
      between spending time doing stuff other than writing code&mdash;stuff like
      figuring out and writing down what you're going to build and how
      you'll build it&mdash;and ending up not just with better code, but with better
      code more quickly than they would otherwise</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: I think a lot of it is
      because we don't communicate about all of the <a name="idx-CHP-11-0278"></a>goals of the application or the product that we're trying
      to build. Occasionally, it's not worth writing really high-quality code
      and we have to acknowledge that, and in those situations, perhaps, rush
      through it.</p>
<p class="docText">I work with some clients that do websites for advertising or
      marketing campaigns. Let's say we're doing a website to do a tie-in to a
      movie that's coming out. That site's got to last for a couple months. I
      don't need the same quality of code for that as I do if I'm writing
      something like Microsoft Office. If I expect code to live for 10 years
      or longer, I need to make an investment in writing good code.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Let's go back to your initial statement that if
      you write good code it ends up going more quickly than if you write bad
      code. How does that fit with what you just said?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Well, because the payback
      is over time. Writing high-quality code is an investment, and if I'm
      only going to amortize that investment over two months of a short-lived
      website, I may not have the chance to earn back the investment in
      quality.</p>
<p class="docText">If the application's going to exist for years, the investment I
      take in going very methodically, being very careful with what I write,
      that's going to have much more time to pay back.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Let me make sure I get what you're saying. Are
      you talking about "paying back" effort in terms of spending less on
      maintenance going forward? I guess I buy that. Your team is going to
      have a much easier time extending and maintaining the code and there'll
      be less of a chance for people to even run across bugs&mdash;you can live with
      more bugs out in the field and distributed to the users. If it's going
      to be there for years, users will find a lot more bugs and will put up
      with a lot less hassle than if they only need to use it for a couple of
      weeks or a couple of months. Is that part of it?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Absolutely. It sounds
      like there's some skepticism here. Let me prove this.</p>
<p class="docText">Imagine you're working on some application you've done in the
      past. You're very diligent; you're the most diligent programmer out
      there in terms of quality and code consciousness, and you want to have
      this really high-quality stuff. There are two parts to this application:
      the application itself, and a data import routine you'll run once to
      move data in from an old system.</p>
<p class="docText">It should be clear that almost everyone in that situation would
      write higher-quality code for the application since it's going to live
      for years. The import routine gets run once. It just doesn't need the
      same rigor that the rest of the application does.</p>
<p class="docText">I feel like I'm justifying writing crappy code here, so I want to
      be careful with that. What I'm trying to say with this is that most
      teams don't have this type of discussion, and they should. This should
      be discussed with stakeholders: "How long is this system <a name="idx-CHP-11-0279"></a>planning to last? What are our big goals here?" We miss
      big opportunities with that.</p>
<p class="docText">I'm going to contend that if we're writing
      this system, and it's going to live <a name="idx-CHP-11-0280"></a>for 10 years, I'm going to write it to a higher <a name="idx-CHP-11-0281"></a>quality of beautiful code than I am something that's a
      one-time "import the data" routine. I certainly have to get the thing
      correct, but I run all my tests, I check it out, I run some sample data,
      it looks good, and I'm done.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: You know what? I'll buy that. I'll buy that at
      the beginning of the project you should actually choose, come up with a
      quality standard. In fact, from a traditional quality management
      perspective, isn't that what acceptance criteria are all about? Or
      target defect rates? That's all stuff we read about in textbooks, but it
      sounds like exactly what you're talking about in the real
      world</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: I think it is something
      that we should talk about that isn't normally talked about.</p>
<p class="docText">Think of how some projects would change. I mean, I don't know that
      we can ever be this honest, but imagine if you had the key stakeholder
      who came in and said, "Here are my goals for this project. I am after my
      next promotion. I want this project to get done. I want it to come out
      well enough that I get that promotion. I expect that to be in the next 6
      to 12 months. After that, I'm going to a completely different division
      and I don't care."</p>
<p class="docText">We would know where that stakeholder's incentives are. I'm not
      necessarily even putting that person down. That's the type of incentive
      some companies create. But that might be how somebody's thinking about
      an application, and it's why teams get pushed to write lower-quality
      code than they might be inclined to otherwise in most cases.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So, how do you figure out the team's incentives?
      A team can really be driven to release good software, but if the quality
      is poor, won't that affect the team's morale? And what happens if people
      on the team are driving toward different goals? What if they have
      different ideas of what they're building and why they're building
      it?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: I want to give a concrete
      example of a company I went and visited in Boston. I met with the VP,
      who brought me in to consult with his organization. I started by asking
      him about the application he brought me in to help with.</p>
<p class="docText">They were building a new system to replace an existing workflow
      system. The original system had been built around 2000&ndash;2002 and had
      amazing JavaScript stuff in it, what today we would call Ajax. This was
      built by some consultants they'd brought in who must have been absolute
      geniuses to have figured all this out way back then. But the application
      was extremely fragile because of how it was done with Ajax before Ajax
      existed.</p>
<p class="docText">I asked the VP why they were rewriting the system, and it was
      purely to get a stable application, one that his team didn't have to
      spend as much time per year maintaining. That was his only goal.</p>
<p class="docText">Then, I went and met with the teams. I wasn't looking for
      miscommunications. I wasn't looking for communication errors. But I just
      asked them. I said, "Why are you doing this application? What are the
      big goals for this project?" I got answers like "We need faster
      performance" and "We need faster throughput because we process more
      documents now." One answer was, "Well, we're
      changing to a new technology because our CTO read about it in an
      in-flight magazine on an airplane and he decided we should switch
      technologies."</p>
<p class="docText">Not one of the five or six developers I spoke with individually
      had the right answer. No one gave the same answer as the VP who had
      initiated the <a name="idx-CHP-11-0282"></a>project. They were making decisions that were leading them
      to create the same poor maintainability issues with their
      application.</p>
<p class="docText">The company had an interesting approach where they only released
      applications to their internal users every three months. This was
      interesting because it made <a name="idx-CHP-11-0283"></a>planning real easy: "Can we meet the June 30 deadline? If
      not, let's go to the September 30 deadline."</p>
<p class="docText">So the boss had said, "Hey, I'd like it by June 30 if you can, but
      I can understand if it's not ready by then because I know that's a
      little aggressive." The team misinterpreted this as schedule pressure
      and was cutting <a name="idx-CHP-11-0284"></a>quality corners to meet the June 30 date.</p>
<p class="docText">When I told that to the boss, he had a fit.</p>
<p class="docText">This was a team that didn't have that conversation at the
      beginning, and was going off and making completely wrong
      decisions.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: You know, it's funny. Hearing you talk about
      that, I can almost hear Jenny's voice talking about a specific team that
      she worked with a while back that had almost exactly the same thing
      happen. There were very clear goals that had nothing to do with the
      deadline, but she had a real disconnect with the team about that. She
      had a heck of a time getting them to let the deadline slip and
      concentrate on quality instead. Jenny, do you remember that
      one?</span><a name="idx-CHP-11-0285"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Yeah, and the way that we were able to finally
      fix it was to clearly write down the scope and make sure everybody
      understood it. But you're right, people had a tendency to fixate on the
      release dates, and on making sure that everything fit into the timeline.
      They weren't really thinking hard enough about the actual goal that they
      were trying to achieve</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-11-0286"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I guess that gets back to the idea of a "clear,
      elevating goal" that you've been talking about</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Yep.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So what about that question Jenny brought up
      about team morale and quality?</span><a name="idx-CHP-11-0287"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: You mean, how is team
      morale affected by some of these quality issues? I think that was the
      question.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: The question, to me, is about the morale of a
      team that's building poor-quality software. I mean, if you know you're
      building something that's, say, slightly crappier, is that all right?
      How does asking a team to cut corners affect them?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Again, I want to be real
      careful with this, because 99% of the time when a team thinks they are
      being pressured to write crappy code, they aren't. Usually it's the
      result of the stakeholders and developers not being in alignment on the
      goals of the project.</p>
<p class="docText">Earlier I was trying to make the point that
      most of the time we should be writing far higher-<a name="idx-CHP-11-0288"></a>quality code than we are, and that one of the ways to get
      that some of the time is to realize that not everything in an
      application needs to be coded to the same quality level.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the correlations I draw there is I remember that when I
      started hiring people into different organizations, I noticed something
      unusual about the fresh college graduates. They felt like every
      assignment had to be their A-quality work. They were trying to impress
      me with their A-quality work on everything they did.</p>
<p class="docText">I thought about it, and I realized that was what they were used
      to. You're in college; you've got five or six different professors. One
      professor doesn't say, "Oh, well, I'll grade you up a little bit because
      I know you had a hard time in biology class this semester, so I'll take
      it easy on you. I only need your B-quality work and I'll give you an
      A."</p>
<p class="docText">You were graded independently on each thing. I realized that as I
      was giving people different assignments, sometimes I had to say, "Do
      this the best you can." But for other times&mdash;let's make it about
      something other than coding, like doing a vendor assessment&mdash;I'd say,
      "We're going to pick a calendar widget from our application. There are
      eight good choices. It's not like we're going to go
      <span class="docEmphasis">that</span> wrong. Go spend two hours checking them out
      and pick one."</p>
<p class="docText">I'd have somebody fresh out of school feel like they had to go
      spend 20 hours on it and make the absolutely perfect decision. "We'll
      never regret this decision!" they'd think. Meanwhile, I would have
      preferred a good decision and 18 hours left for other work.</p>
<p class="docText">That's the kind of distinction I'm trying to draw there: not
      everything needs somebody's A-quality work. We're not even, in most
      cases, given the opportunity to do that.</p>
<p class="docText">Does that make sense? I want to make sure I'm not coming across as
      saying that I want crappy code. I mean, yes, I gave one example;
      sometimes it's OK, but normally it's not.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That makes sense</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: I still want to stick
      with a comment on this morale thing for a moment. It's a little bit
      different from anything you exactly asked, but I think it gets to the
      real question here. I want to tell you about a team that I worked
      with.</p>
<p class="docText">I was managing a very large project in one of the companies I
      worked at, and we had a secondary project going on. It wasn't as
      important, but any project is important. We had some people on that
      project who were under some very weird management restrictions.</p>
<p class="docText">For example, they were told they were not allowed to do any error
      handling. If an error happened, the boss didn't care. The application
      could crash. He didn't care. It was just bizarre.</p>
<p class="docText">I had heard about a few of these unusual things, but I was swamped
      with the project I had, the critical project. I didn't get involved in
      this other one. I just heard about some aspects of it.</p>
<p class="docText">A lot of nights I don't sleep well, so I'll
      get up and go into the office early. It was a stressful project, and I
      went in real early one morning, about 5:00. It's 5:00 a.m. when I get
      into the office, and I meet the other two developers, the two main
      developers on the other project, Jeff and Donna.</p>
<p class="docText">I said, "What are you guys doing here?" They didn't want to talk
      at first. But they eventually confessed: "We're here adding error
      handling and doing testing. The boss doesn't let us do it on the
      application, but our pride is tied to this thing. We can't put out an
      application that is like what he's asking for."</p>
<p class="docText">For the past three months, they had been coming in at five in the
      morning and working until seven. At 7:00 a.m., they would go out to the
      local Denny's for breakfast. They'd have breakfast from 7:00 to 8:00,
      show up at 8:00, and pretend they were just getting there for the day!
      They'd then work until 5:00 or 6:00 at night on their
      application.</p>
<p class="docText">After I ran into them that one morning at 5:00, we talked it out.
      I was a manager. They were programmers. They said, "Can you please help
      us out? Talk to our boss; figure out what's going on. We can't keep
      doing this." And this is where it gets at the morale question, because
      they were beating themselves up over their boss's insistence that they
      put out a low-<a name="idx-CHP-11-0289"></a>quality product.</p>
<p class="docText">So I went to talk to the boss, and I said, "What is going on here?
      Why aren't you letting them add error handling, do testing, and write a
      high-quality product? I agree with them that it's wrong." I told him
      what had been going on. And he came clean. Here was the
      situation.</p>
<p class="docText">This was back when it was kind of in vogue to name projects after
      cities. Microsoft had done it and so companies were naming projects with
      code names after cities. I was working on a project called the Napa
      Project, after Napa, California. Their project was called Dodge City,
      like the old western Dodge City.</p>
<p class="docText">The boss had named their project Dodge City because of the idea of
      walking down a Universal Studios set&mdash;you see Dodge City on the side and
      it's just a fa&ccedil;ade. It's just the front of the building. There's nothing
      behind it. There's no depth, it's not real.</p>
<p class="docText">He was having them work on an application that they could demo at
      an upcoming trade show to entice people to renew their licenses because
      of the great new version that was coming. But that version would never
      be released. He was never going to come out with the next new version.
      He was going to upsell people into the related product I was working
      on.</p>
<p class="docText">These developers were on a fake application, the ultimate
      vaporware, which is why they didn't need any error handling, why it was
      meant to just be like a good, old Norton demo type of thing from the
      '80s.</p>
<p class="docText">Here was a team killing themselves to do things that legitimately
      weren't needed. Apart from the ethics of lying to your customer base
      like this, what a horrible thing for that team.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: How frustrating for them!
      If the boss had been transparent about everything from the beginning,
      had he been upfront with the team about that goal, they would have
      understood and probably would have done a better job making it look as
      good as possible in a way that absolutely didn't have to work. Because
      when you think about it, your hands are really tied by projects that
      have to work. If they don't have to work, you can do some things that
      look amazingly cool. All the boss needs is something he can talk about
      and give hints to his customers</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Right. What he needed
      were the paths through it that he could demonstrate at a big trade show.
      If there was an error, he just wouldn't demo that little path, or he'd
      make up some other data and go through a different path to do it. He
      could have a carefully scripted demo and run that only.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I like that story&mdash;it really ties together the
      two ideas we've been talking about: the idea of time, quality, and
      morale, and the idea of how understanding the vision, understanding the
      main goal of the project, really does have a huge effect on
      quality</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-11-0290"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">I guess that brings me to one of the reasons we really
      wanted to talk to you more than anything else because you spent a lot of
      time talking about practices, about things that programmers do to make
      their code better, to improve the quality of the
      code</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-11-0291"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Let's say I put you on the spot; you had to choose one,
      two, three practices that really could make a difference in quality of
      code and how well you plan your project. What would you&mdash;if a team that
      was just stuck and wasn't sure what to do&mdash;what would you tell them to do
      first?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: The first one's easy. The
      absolute first thing I would want a team to do is a <a name="idx-CHP-11-0292"></a>continuous integration approach. I just think that is the
      greatest thing to do.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember&mdash;this is going way back, it was about 1992. One of the
      teams I was working with had the typical C++ application of the era,
      where just due to some external dependencies and things like that our
      build times had started to go through the roof.</p>
<p class="docText">We didn't know quite enough about networking to set something up
      like a good build server. For various reasons, Novell print queues just
      happened to be something we'd been using with our application.</p>
<p class="docText">I know this just sounds bizarre, but it was fantastic at the time.
      We actually wrote a build server that monitored a Novell print queue.
      Novell print queues were wonderful. They could hold anything. We put
      compile jobs into the Novell print queue, and we had a build server that
      would just monitor it and kick off compiles whenever it noticed anything
      getting inserted in there.</p>
<p class="docText">It was a completely cheesy, crappy way to do this network
      communication, but just on that application it had tremendous benefits.
      We had a little thing you inserted into the queue and the build would
      kick off.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't know why we never took that to the next idea of having it
      monitor the version control system. It took another seven or eight years
      before I ever saw a team doing that. That
      completely changed what I wanted to do. It's just such a wonderful
      technique.</p>
<p class="docText">So my first one would be continuous integration. I think that's
      huge for teams.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I like continuous integration as a first step,
      because it's something a team can do by themselves. No manager will ever
      object to it, because any manager who understands it well enough will
      generally be in favor of it. It seems like just the sort of stuff
      programmers do anyway</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Yeah, great point.
      There's nothing you can object to about it. I think to your point it's
      not even one I think you have to go to your manager and say you're
      doing. You do it.</p>
<p class="docText">I'm not trying to mislead managers. I mean, I've been one for many
      years. But I'll meet teams that obsess about it: "How do I sell my
      manager on continuous integration?" You don't. I mean, how do you sell
      your manager on the fact that you need to compile your code? It's a fact
      of life. You do it.</p>
<p class="docText">You're right, that's not one I think you have to go and beg a lot
      of permission for. Maybe you've got to buy some hardware or something,
      but just go find an old desktop lying around and it's good enough to get
      started.</p>
<p class="docText">The second thing that I really want teams to do is to get some
      level of <a name="idx-CHP-11-0293"></a>test automation in place. This can obviously tie to the
      first goal of continuous integration. It's one thing to have the
      application building continuously; at least we know that everything at
      least integrates at a compiled level. But I'd sure like to get some
      automated tests going with that. That's a big challenge for many
      teams.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't really care what level they're testing at, whether it's
      unit tests or what I'd call the service layer, with tools like FitNesse,
      or even if it's a little bit more of a scripted user interface type of
      testing.</p>
<p class="docText">I certainly have preferences on how they phase in those tests, but
      it's most important to just start somewhere. Often it's easiest to start
      with some high-level user interface tests. Automate that regression test
      that's sitting around that you have to run manually. Get that automated
      at a user interface level and then start really working on getting the
      other types of testing added in.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I like that you addressed just the code and
      build and quality testing. But what about planning? That's something
      that can have a huge effect on the project, but it's also something that
      can be surprisingly hard to sell to the team, or to the boss, or
      both</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-11-0294"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: I wrote a book on
      <a name="idx-CHP-11-0295"></a>planning because I got so frustrated with agile teams
      running around saying, "We're agile. We don't plan." This was common in
      the early days of agile, through perhaps 2004.</p>
<p class="docText">It just bothered me because my experience up until then had been
      as a vice president of engineering at a couple of different companies,
      and I'd have been furious if one of my teams had come to me with a
      process I didn't know about and told me how wonderful it was. "It's
      faster and customers like the results and it's higher quality," and all
      these wonderful things that we often get from agile
      teams. But then they threw in the kicker: "But we have to give up all
      predictability."</p>
<p class="docText">I would have been furious, because that would have been teasing me
      with a great process I couldn't use. I don't care how good the rest of
      the process is. If it doesn't allow some degree of predictability, I
      can't use it.</p>
<p class="docText">From my experience having done it with various teams, I knew that
      agile teams could plan. I ended up writing that book on it just because
      I wanted to try to dispel this myth of "We're agile. We don't
      plan."</p>
<p class="docText">I don't hear that argument a whole lot anymore, so I hope I've
      been somewhat successful. That and, I guess, it's mostly been a matter
      of time and teams proving it can be done. There are enough agile teams
      out there doing <a name="idx-CHP-11-0296"></a>planning. That's what probably has the biggest impact:
      when you see other teams doing agile planning, it's hard to say that you
      can't.</p>
<p class="docText">I definitely want teams to plan. But your initial question was,
      what were the first couple things I'd want a team to go do.</p>
<p class="docText">Normally, the first one is not planning. Teams have to start
      getting their act together with a lot of other stuff before they get a
      chance to really worry about anybody's opinion of their planning
      capabilities.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: That's a good point. Initially, when we started
      this conversation you were saying that not understanding the goal was a
      big problem in keeping teams in line with what they needed to
      build</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">I wonder&mdash;all of the tools that you mentioned were about
      executing the project and building the code, and not really about
      understanding the project's goals. Do you think that that's something
      that teams can work on? Are there specific practices around that that
      you would recommend?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Around <a name="idx-CHP-11-0297"></a>improving the planning? Yes, absolutely. Jim Highsmith
      documented a number of them in his book, <span class="docEmphasis">Agile Project
      Management</span> (Addison-Wesley). He talks about having teams
      write what's called an <a name="idx-CHP-11-0298"></a>elevator statement. This is a two-sentence statement that
      you can give a stranger who meets you in the elevator and asks, "What do
      you do?"</p>
<p class="docText">But beyond some of those, I've done things like have a team write
      the magazine review that you'd like to have come out about your product
      once it's done.</p>
<p class="docText">I did this with a company that was doing anti-spyware software.
      Their product had just been reviewed by a magazine as the second best
      product in their field. It was the runner-up to an editor's choice
      award. Now, one way to think about this is if I were the director of the
      second best movie of the year, I'd be pretty happy. I'd make a ton of
      money. You've got the second best movie. People go to more than one
      movie. But the second best anti-spyware product? People buy only one of
      those.</p>
<p class="docText">Being second best in a niche like that was not a good thing for
      them. So, they got serious about some of their process changes they were
      putting in place, and I asked their ScrumMaster who
      was working with them, Erin, to have the team write a magazine review
      that would summarize what they wanted to have said about them six months
      later when the next review cycle happened.</p>
<p class="docText">This was about establishing their clear, elevating goal. And it
      worked. They wrote the magazine review, and I remember the day about six
      months later when the real review came out. I remember it was Halloween
      and I was home. I wasn't traveling or working that day. I took my kids
      trick-or-treating, came home, and checked my email at about maybe 10:15
      at night before getting ready for bed. I had a three-word email from
      Erin saying, "We did it!"</p>
<p class="docText">A week later, when I could read the real magazine review, I
      noticed there were sentences in it that were very close to what the team
      had written in their version of the review: "Finds more spies than any
      other spyware product." "Removes spies that other products couldn't even
      find." There were sentences like these that the team had established as
      its goal in writing a review six months in advance.</p>
<p class="docText">That was a testament to the team working with its stakeholder,
      figuring out what it is they were trying to achieve in this release over
      the next six months, and then making it happen because they had that
      very tangible goal very clearly in mind.</p>
<p class="docText">Have teams do things like that to solidify that goal. The vision
      is then shared among all team members.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I had one more question about planning.
      Specifically, I want to talk a little bit about task boards. I've seen a
      reasonable amount of writing about task boards attributed to
      you</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-11-0299"></a><a name="idx-CHP-11-0300"></a><a name="idx-CHP-11-0301"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">More importantly, what do you think of when you think
      about the differences between working on an agile project and working on
      a traditionally project-managed project? It's certainly clear that we
      don't have a schedule in the traditional sense, or structured estimates,
      or those things that you normally associate with a dry, dusty binder
      full of paper. But for a lot of agile projects you've got this task
      board, a living whiteboard that seems to do a reasonably good job of
      actually planning things out&mdash;in a way that programmers actually
      embrace</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Now, I'm a little bit torn here, because I've definitely
      gotten a lot of success over the years out of those dusty binders full
      of planning and project schedules. But I can't deny that task boards and
      other agile planning tools have been really successful. So, would you
      include something like a task board in your two or three practices that
      you'd tell a team to adopt immediately? Can you give us a little
      background, tell us how a task board works?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: A task board is a
      practice that I would have a team start doing right off if they were
      doing agile. So toss it in as one of the three practices from your prior
      question.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember when I first started doing that with my Scrum teams. I
      wasn't aware of anyone else doing them; it was just an idea I had that I
      thought would help a particular team I was working with. This team
      wasn't getting the concept of teamwork. We had done a nice
      <a name="idx-CHP-11-0302"></a>planning meeting. We had a big list <a name="idx-CHP-11-0303"></a>of things that needed to be done. But people didn't
      understand that they were to be a team. They were just a group of
      individuals.</p>
<p class="docText">This was a team that had switched from a traditional process. I
      was introducing Scrum to them. I grabbed some big 2-foot x 3-foot sheets
      of paper and I said, "OK, this sheet of paper is for this user story and
      that sheet of paper is for that other user story." And we just taped
      index cards to them.</p>
<p class="docText">There was no logical arrangement to the cards. Each big sheet of
      paper represented one user story or feature being worked on. Each thing
      we had to do was represented by one index card.</p>
<p class="docText">About a week later, I could see that things had gotten a little
      better with this group of individuals, but it still wasn't connecting
      with them that they had to be a team. People would come in and we'd do
      our daily standup Scrum meetings, but people would only talk about their
      own <a name="idx-CHP-11-0304"></a>tasks. They had no interest in anybody else's work.</p>
<p class="docText">We finished up that meeting, and I remember taking the sheets of
      paper down and organizing them onto a great big whiteboard that this
      company had. I stretched it out and I drew columns: "Here are the things
      that we haven't started yet; the to-do column." I made a column of work
      that's in process, and a column for work that was already done. I said,
      "We're just going to move the cards very tangibly across this," and it
      clicked with that team right off.</p>
<p class="docText">Since then, this has been something that I always encourage teams
      to do. Any sort of collocated team in the same building, I think, is
      going to benefit from putting an iteration plan on index cards or
      Post-its, and putting them up into some sort of loosely structured
      form&mdash;a task board&mdash;up on the wall.</p>
<p class="docText">The task board outlines the steps that work has to go through.
      Whether it's a step like the design, coding, and even testing, just
      something that shows this is not started, this is being done, and this
      is done. A task board like that is about as complicated as I ever want
      one to get, but I've certainly seen teams do far more with that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds to me like it's less about what are we
      going to be doing in a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, two
      months, a year, and more about what we're doing right now. It's about
      figuring out where the project stands, at a glance</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: I think that's part of
      it. Ideally, the team walks in and they see a bunch of work up on the
      board and they say, "What's the most important thing for me to do right
      now, today? Of all that work up there, what's the most important thing
      for me to do?"</p>
<p class="docText">We're not looking out six months on a task board. Task planning is
      normally done at the start of a two- or four-week iteration. The task
      board is wiped clean at the end and starts all over again for the next
      iteration.</p>
<p class="docText">It doesn't have to be complicated. I remember when I first started
      doing these. I had incredible fears that as kind of the traditionally
      trained project manager, I would be the only one to
      see a critical path. There'd be a <a name="idx-CHP-11-0305"></a>critical path of work and no one would see it but me, the
      project manager.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">A typical task board, with all of its parts labeled.
      (Image used with permission of Clinton Keith.)</span></p>
<p class="docText">I worried about that for the first, maybe, six months. After a
      while, I eventually realized that no matter how smart I thought I was,
      my team collectively was far smarter than me. If there was a critical
      path up there on the board, they would see it. This freed me up from
      having to worry about those things. I still haven't had a team that
      bumped up against the last day and said, "Uh-oh, there's not that many
      hours of work left, but there are sequential dependencies between them
      and now we're screwed." I've never had a team make that type of
      mistake.<a name="idx-CHP-11-0306"></a></p>
<p class="docText">The short time boxes and typically small team sizes that we have
      eliminate that whole class of issues that we would otherwise
      have.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Actually, that comes back to something you said
      earlier about being frustrated with agile teams that say they can't
      deliver predictability. It's definitely clear how you can do planning
      for a short-term iteration. You're looking at the next three weeks, or
      the next four weeks, or six weeks, the next sprint or the next
      iteration. How does that fit with being able to give your manager enough
      information to plan the next six months, or the next
      year?</span><a name="idx-CHP-11-0307"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: You absolutely have to be
      able to plan the next six months. You might even have to do a little
      <a name="idx-CHP-11-0308"></a>planning the next year or two years. But the key is you
      have to be able to plan them with far less <a name="idx-CHP-11-0309"></a>precision.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">A task board that uses index cards held up with magnets.

      Owens.)</span></p>
<p class="docText">I'm sitting here on October 22. There's not a
      project around that has to be able to say, right now, today, "OK, we've
      got our delivery date. It will be next September 16." I can't even
      imagine a scenario where that has to be the case. What would happen if
      it was September 15 or September 17? That level of precision is just not
      necessary over that longer term.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, I want to be careful. I'm not saying that we don't have to
      commit to a September 15 date 11 months in advance. But if we do, then
      we need to have some flexibility in the scope. The key is we don't have
      to lock those things down 11 or 12 months in advance. Teams need a
      little bit of flexibility and the business should be fine with
      that.</p>
<p class="docText">If we're looking at a project that we want out 12 months from now,
      we have to know a couple of different things. I have to know from the
      team about how long it's going to take, and I have to know from somebody
      in product management or marketing how much money are we going to
      make.</p>
<p class="docText">But I don't need to know how much money we're going to make down
      to the nearest dollar or euro, just like I don't need to know the
      schedule down to the nearest day. Giving me those things with less
      precision, as long as they're accurate, is OK. We can still make an
      appropriate decision, which is all that's really necessary.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-11-0310"></a><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I have one more question I wanted to
      ask. Jenny and I have done a lot of speaking and training all over the
      world, and we've talked to a lot of people from all around the software
      industry. And one thing I've noticed is that there seems to be a small
      group of highly zealous agile evangelists. I think you've sort of
      referenced this a little bit: I'm talking about the sort of person for
      whom agile is a be-all and end-all answer to
      everything</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Now, personally, I don't believe there's one silver
      bullet that solves all project problems. I do believe that many agile
      teams use some very good practices that can help a lot of teams, agile
      or otherwise, to build better software. You've given some really good
      examples of those practices. I also believe that everyone, myself
      included, should always keep an open mind about the way we do our jobs,
      and we should always be looking for ways to improve our own software
      development</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">But there are a small number of zealots and evangelists
      who, as far as I can tell, apparently claim that there's only one true
      way to build software, and that everyone else in the world should change
      the way they do things, even if their current methods work just
      fine</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">And I've noticed that you don't do that at all. So, I
      want to know if you've noticed the zealotry that I'm talking about. How
      have you avoided falling into that? Or, on the other hand, do you think
      that I have it wrong? Is vocal agile evangelism&mdash;to the exclusion of all
      other ways of thinking about building software&mdash;a good thing that people
      should be falling into? I know that's kind of a loaded question, but I
      think you know what I mean</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-11-0311"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mike</span>: Well, I don't think agile
      zealotry really gets us anywhere. I think the agile approaches are the
      right way to do things. I'm certainly a huge advocate of that. But I
      think two things prevent me from becoming an overzealous agile
      advocate.</p>
<p class="docText">One is that it's just totally by luck that this is how I've always
      done software. When I started out, in my first real job in a company
      (other than a very small company), I was doing software in a division of
      Andersen Consulting back in what was called their Litigation Information
      Services division. We worked on lawsuits. We worked on projects for
      people and companies who were being sued.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember working on very high-profile lawsuits. When you're
      working on those types of projects, you can't take a month or two to get
      something done. An attorney would come to you and say, "We need a
      program to solve this problem. We need it now." We needed to have very
      short cycles and turnaround periods on things like that.</p>
<p class="docText">I got lucky, and just kind of learned how to build software in
      that way back in the 1980s. I became agile just by luck and
      circumstance. The nature of the businesses I was in led me to do
      this.</p>
<p class="docText">I think the second thing that influences me is having lived
      through the object revolution. I think agile is the second wave of the
      object-oriented (OO) revolution. Agile is a continuation of that idea,
      which is why we saw that so many of the early, great OO thinkers found
      the agile movement. They were just continuing what started with
      objects.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't hear people saying things like, "I
      have to go to the OO design meeting today." They just say, "I have to go
      to the design meeting." Objects won; nobody talks about OO. Nobody asks,
      "Is this a structured design meeting or an object-oriented design
      meeting?" Objects won, as they should have. For the most part, teams do
      object-oriented development. (I know there are some applications that
      don't and can't.)</p>
<p class="docText">I want agile to be the same type of thing. I'd like the word
      <span class="docEmphasis">agile</span> to go away. I'd like eventually not to be
      talking about agile software development. I'd rather just be talking
      about software development. I don't know if it's another 5 or 10 years
      or whatever it takes, but eventually we'll stop talking about agile and
      it will just be how we do it.</p>
<p class="docText">Some projects are more or less agile than others, just like some
      projects make better use of objects than others. We won't need books
      with "agile" in the title. We won't need an Agile Software Conference.
      It'll just be the Software Conference.</p>
<p class="docText">Agile goes away as a concept and it wins. It simply becomes how we
      do things.</p>
