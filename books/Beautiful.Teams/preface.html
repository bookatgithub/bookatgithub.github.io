<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBoldItalic">BEAUTIFUL TEAMS</span> <span class="docEmphStrong">WAS CONCEIVED IN LATE 2007 DURING A CHANCE MEETING IN
    O'REILLY EDITOR</span> Andy Oram's office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
    We'd been invited to give a talk for the local PMI chapter, and we decided
    to take the opportunity to drop by the O'Reilly office to say "Hi" and
    finally put faces to some very familiar voices we'd worked with over the
    years. <span class="docEmphasis">Beautiful Code</span> had spent a few months at the
    top of the O'Reilly bestseller list, and the company was looking to follow
    up with another anthology. Since we've spent so much of our careers
    talking and writing about how projects work and how teams build software,
    the idea for <span class="docEmphasis">Beautiful Teams</span> basically fell out of
    thin air.</p>
<p class="docText">The original idea was just to follow up on <span class="docEmphasis">Beautiful
    Code</span> with a straightforward anthology about project management.
    Like all great projects, <span class="docEmphasis">Beautiful Teams</span> took on a
    life of its own. It attracted contributors of an incredibly high caliber.
    It became a journey for us, allowing us the opportunity to learn from some
    of the brightest minds in software development today. These are personal
    stories and experiences. Each person who contributed to this book is
    talking about his or her own past work life, which very few of us ever get
    a chance to examine. And every single contributor was happy to donate his
    or her time and effort without any payment whatsoever; proceeds from this
    book are instead being donated to PlayPumps International.</p>

<h3 id="title-IDALS1YP" class="docSection1Title">00.10. About the Editors</h3>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andrew Stellman</span> started work as
      a programmer at a national record label after graduating from the School
      of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He spent the first
      few years focusing on technical design and architecture, but found
      himself increasingly responsible for leading and then managing the teams
      he was on. Over the last decade, Andrew has led teams of programmers and
      managed numerous projects. He now spends his time building his own
      projects and helping the people around him improve the way they manage
      theirs.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Jennifer Greene</span> began her
      software engineering career in the early 1990s at a well-known online
      service. She has since built and led software engineering teams in
      organizations spanning finance, non-profit, natural language processing
      and media. She has built and managed distributed software teams and
      worked with developers around the world to improve their practices and
      build better software.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Jennifer</span> and <span class="docEmphStrong">Andrew</span> have been working together since 1998
      building software and training software teams. They initially defined
      the software process at the company where they were working, and have
      since run many successful projects together. Their projects have been
      focused on science and public health, and they have built software for
      the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, the Business
      School (also at Columbia University), and the National Academy of
      Sciences. They have since branched out into commercial project
      management and software engineering consulting, providing training,
      project management, outsourced project management, and professional
      services to both the business and academic communities.</p>
<p class="docText">Their first book, <span class="docEmphasis">Applied Software Project
      Management</span>, was published by O'Reilly in 2005, and has since
      been adopted as a software engineering textbook at many universities
