        were both artistic and commercial successes. We wanted to know how he
        did it&#8230;and to our amazement, he sat down with Andrew and told us! And
        it turns out that what he has to say is surprisingly relevant to the
        way we build software.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Thanks so much for taking
      the time to do this. Since you're a producer, I want to start out by
      talking about just what it is that you do. Because I think a lot of
      people don't really have any idea what a producer does. There's an old
      Rocky and Bullwinkle episode where Boris Badenov hires Bullwinkle as a
      movie producer. Bullwinkle asks Boris what a producer produces, and
      Boris says, "Money." I've definitely noticed that people who have job
      titles like "producer," "art director," "editor," and "project manager"
      seem to have a lot in common. So, how would you describe what you
      do?</span><a name="idx-CHP-31-0932"></a><a name="idx-CHP-31-0933"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Well, those job
      definitions are very vague at best, because what someone brings to a job
      needs to be defined. My style of production is different from, say, a
      Hugh Padgham style of production, or even George Martin's style of
      production. A producer of a record is more like&mdash;well, one of the jobs is
      money manager. We don't raise the money, but in the old days, producers
      used to raise the money. Nowadays, the record company is the actual
      producer of an album or a project.</p>
<p class="docText">They'll say, "We have so much money and we'd like you to make us
      this kind of an album." So, they define the nature of the job in the
      first place. I, as the producer of the record, manage the entire
      production of the record from the moment it's handed over to me to the
      moment it's delivered. The responsibility is mine.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That sounds a lot like what a project manager
      does. Or what a team leader does, in a lot of ways&mdash;but when a lead
      developer is doing that, he's basically wearing a project manager
      hat</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Yes, I guess that's a
      project manager&mdash;it's probably the similar thing in your world.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And what you said about vague job definitions
      definitely makes sense in this case. Ask any programmer on a team, "What
      does a project manager do?" If they can come up with an answer at all,
      what you said is pretty close to what they would say. And I suspect that
      if you ask a musician in a band working on an album, they would have a
      lot of trouble saying exactly what it is a producer does, too, except
      that he sometimes tells you what to do and disagrees with you a
      lot</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-31-0934"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">What do you think qualifies someone to be a good
      producer, or an effective project manager?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: I believe that if someone
      is going to be a project manager, they should have very intimate
      knowledge of all the jobs that they are going to manage. All the
      different stages, all the levels of work that needs to be done, like
      differentiate between the creative team and the logistical team. I mean,
      there are members in the team who are responsible for creativity, and
      members who are responsible for logistics, how to proceed, that things
      have to be done in an orderly way. So, a producer should know how to do
      these things.</p>
<p class="docText">I think a producer&mdash;or a project manager&mdash;should come up from the
      ranks, and should have had practical day-to-day work on all the jobs
      they are about to manage. Otherwise, they really won't understand the
      situation, and they'll be at the mercy of a person who's trying to get
      away with murder, someone who's trying to shirk their responsibilities.
      I've done every single job in the <a name="idx-CHP-31-0935"></a>music business. I've been signed as a recording
      artist.</p>
<p class="docText">I've played bass. I've played guitar. I've
      played piano. And at one point I learned how to become an engineer. I
      learned how to orchestrate and write for orchestras&mdash;actually write real
      <a name="idx-CHP-31-0936"></a>music on real paper and have <a name="idx-CHP-31-0937"></a>musicians play off the paper.</p>
<p class="docText">Nowadays, I don't actually do all of those jobs at the level I
      used to do, because they were solitary jobs. I would be a bass player in
      one situation or I'd be an orchestrator in another. I can manage a team
      full of people in a recording situation because I know exactly what it
      takes to do those jobs.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: But you wouldn't necessarily be the best person
      for any of those jobs, better than a better musician or a better
      orchestrator or a better engineer than the people you're working with.
      You don't need to be the best, just have a good working knowledge of
      each job</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: As years go on, I find
      that I don't want to do those jobs because it's just too much to do all
      those things at the same time. But when you have a lower budget, people
      will have to double up on jobs. For instance, if the budget is so small
      that I can afford only one assistant and we have to record a band, then
      I will take on a couple of jobs involved there. I'll be managing myself,
      in a way. But ideally, you want to have a team of experts. I know I'm a
      good bass player, but I want someone who's actually a great bass
      player.</p>
<p class="docText">I know what I can expect of a person on my team because of my
      experience. I know what's possible, and often my requests verge on the
      impossible. I can get performances out of musicians only because I know,
      I just know what can be done. I don't necessarily have to be better than
      them, but I think I'm qualified to direct them and to coach them because
      I've done that job.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, it's almost like a respect thing. Someone's
      really only going to take your direction or take your advice if they
      respect your ability, at least respect that you know enough to give them
      that kind of direction</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-31-0938"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Yes. It's akin to martial
      arts. You won't respect somebody who's been doing martial arts for six
      months to teach you. Even as a novice, you can see that their body is
      uncoordinated and they can't really do what they're talking about. But
      when you study with a great martial arts teacher who's practiced for 35
      years, then there's respect; you will do anything that person says. And
      if that guy's really experienced in everything he talks about, you have
      to respect that person. And he will respect you, because you come to him
      to learn or to achieve something.</p>
<p class="docText">So, that's the way I see it. I don't know if it sounds arrogant,
      but this happened to me quite early on because I studied music at a very
      early age. I would say I was qualified to be a record producer by the
      time I was 25 years old. The thing I did not have was people skills. For
      me, that came out of the school of hard knocks. Learning how to speak to
      people is actually a very important lesson to learn. How to actually
      communicate to people without anger, without sounding dishonest,
      disingenuous.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What happens if you don't
      communicate well with people, with respect or honesty? What if you're
      transparent or disingenuous? What goes wrong on your team, with your
      project?</span><a name="idx-CHP-31-0939"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a name="idx-CHP-31-0940"></a>Tony</span>: Well, if you don't correct problems
      directly and efficiently, then you'll lose their interest. They'll lose
      respect for you, and they'll lose interest in what you say. They'll
      think you don't know what you're talking about. That's the worst thing
      in the world to happen to a producer or project manager&mdash;where you're
      perceived as some kind <a name="idx-CHP-31-0941"></a>of a dork who hasn't a clue. You don't ever want that to
      happen. You've lost the team once that happens.</p>
<p class="docText">And I'll tell you, if you do happen to put your foot in your
      mouth, a way to regain the respect of the team is to simply say, "I've
      made a mistake, could we start again on this? I've given it a lot of
      thought and I made a judgment error." That's how you gain the respect of
      a team again after you've lost it: you have to admit that you've made a
      mistake. Your honesty and courage to admit mistakes will maintain your
      team's respect. If you try to cover up your ignorance, or if you try to
      look cool all the time, you just get deeper and deeper into phoniness
      and your team will drift away from you.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I definitely see really similar things on
      programming teams. It's not enough for a team leader to be respectable.
      You have to have&mdash;I don't want to call humility, but at least a
      willingness to see that somebody else is right</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Yes.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And I know a lot of programmers have trouble
      with that. I'm assuming that a lot of rock stars do,
      too</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: There're always going to
      be differences of opinion, but the hierarchy is always the same. The
      person who is managing the project is in charge. That always has to be
      clear and understood. But that does not give you a license to be a
      tyrant. One of the most positive goals of a good project manager is to
      bring out the best in the people in the project, not to stifle them, not
      to hold them back, not to squeeze them between two walls. It's very
      dangerous to do things like that. What you want to do is to create
      heroes on your team, to make people on your team&mdash;well, all of them if
      possible&mdash;make them shine, to really make your team look like the A
      team.</p>
<p class="docText">And you're not going to get that if you don't listen to them. In
      order for them to be members of the A team, you have to let their
      opinions be heard; you have to, you must. This also means that you have
      to be a flexible thinker and able to modify the goal of the project. If
      some maverick kind of idea comes up that can be incorporated&mdash;some stroke
      of genius comes from a team member&mdash;you have to be open to that. Even if
      it seems like a ridiculous idea at first, don't make snap decisions.
      Don't say, "Oh no, this isn't in the plan, it's not going to work." Take
      time to consider all ideas.</p>
<p class="docText">If a maverick idea turns out to be a bad idea, don't humiliate the
      proposer. You have to get across to your team that an idea is only an
      idea and they arise spontaneously. You don't want to make it personal
      when you're rejecting someone's idea. You can sincerely say it was a
      good idea, but not really germane to this project. There are ways of
      communicating, where you bring out the best in
      someone and you don't stifle them when you really feel that they're
      going down the wrong path.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What happens if you feel the whole project is
      going in the wrong direction? You know you need to get it on the right
      track, but you just have a feeling that a lot of people on the team are
      going to be hard to convince. Even if they'll be happy with the final
      product after you change direction, the idea of making the change just
      isn't going to sit well with them. How do you handle it if there's just
      something that they don't want to do, some change that you know is going
      to meet with resistance? You have to be the bearer of bad news. How do
      you handle a situation like that?</span><a name="idx-CHP-31-0942"></a><a name="idx-CHP-31-0943"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Well, the nature of my
      business is it's very visceral. <a name="idx-CHP-31-0944"></a>Music is an emotional product. People laugh and cry and
      make babies and dance to <a name="idx-CHP-31-0945"></a>music. Music serves a lot of purposes in life, and it's
      very, very emotional. And I think everyone has a common feeling when
      they're making music. You kind of feel it in your gut that things are
      going well. I mean, it's very, very clear after a playback, when
      somebody's played really well&mdash;they come in and usually you see smiling
      faces. If you don't see smiling faces, and you yourself are not smiling,
      then something is going wrong. That's all I think a project manager has
      to say: "We're doing it wrong. We have to go back to the drawing
      board."</p>
<p class="docText">Don't moan about lost time, because the important thing is that
      the team has derailed and has to get back on the right track. I feel
      that way; I mean, I've stayed up all night recording a track, a vocal,
      or something. We'd come back the next day and we think it should be good
      because we stayed up all night. But you have to tell the truth&mdash;is it
      really good? I find in moments like these there is a common experience
      in the team. These harsh moments are easier to take after the team has
      had a good night's sleep.</p>
<p class="docText">It's simple: it's either good or it's bad, and somebody has to say
      that. I'm a firm believer in honesty when that happens. When that takes
      place, then I think people do fall into line.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Have you ever been in a situation where you feel
      the team has that unity, but the final product just isn't any good?
      Everybody is happy with how it came out. But somebody's paying for
      this&mdash;a record company&mdash;and when you bring it to them you proudly play the
      album for whoever it is you're dealing with there, you can see on their
      faces that this is exactly what they were not looking for, and clearly
      they don't think they can sell this</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Yes.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: How do you handle a situation like that? Say
      they tell you you're going to have to take this back to the drawing
      board, and you've got another couple of months and enough budget to do
      it right. But you know that the team is just not going to want to hear
      that. Nobody wants to be told to go back to the drawing board after they
      think they just nailed it. So, does that happen? How do you deal with
      it?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: It often happens if
      you've waited too long to present it to the person who commissioned this
      work. If you leave that right to the end, then you are going to risk
      that. Your employer doesn't want to know how late you stayed up. They
      don't want to know about your little internal squabbles. That's nothing.
      If your results are not what they expected, they'll
      say to you, "Is this what you brought me after all this time? Is this
      what we paid for?" Now, this is a very tough situation. In some way, you
      have to convince your employer that the results are "just different,"
      and you have to tell your team that some modifications are
      necessary.</p>
<p class="docText">I have turned in some albums that were all but rejected and
      reluctantly released to the public. Sometimes, you're just ahead of your
      time. An artist person I produced was about three years ahead of his
      time when he was younger. He wasn't in sync with what the labels or the
      public wanted. You might hand in what you consider to be your greatest
      work ever, but by the time it's released it is met with blank stares.
      The trouble was my artist wasn't like anyone else. He was too
      iconoclastic, not trendy at first.</p>
<p class="docText">I've learned two ways to avoid that great misunderstanding at the
      end happening. Halfway or maybe three-quarters of the way through the
      project, I bring what I have to the record company and ask them, "What
      do you think? Are we going in the right direction?" Some artists are
      loathe to do that, but it's really important before you go too far. You
      have to get it out of your head that the people paying for the whole
      shebang are the enemy.</p>
<p class="docText">Psychologically, it's going to go a long way, because if the
      people who commissioned it feel included at an early stage, they will be
      more receptive at the end if they feel involved in the middle stages. I
      didn't like to do that in the old days. I liked to wait until the
      finished product, because I was quite young and arrogant. But really,
      you need feedback, and that feedback goes both ways&mdash;because what you're
      telling the client is, "I respect your opinion, and I'd like you to tell
      me what you think of the project so far." So, that's one way I avoid
      having that ego clash at the end.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I like that idea a lot. The idea of an iterative
      process where you do part of the work, until you have something that
      sounds sort of like a finished partial product. Once you've gotten to a
      milestone&mdash;something finished enough that you can bring it to the
      client&mdash;you say, "This is what we've got so far. Here, are we going in
      the right direction? We're at a point where we can change direction if
      we need to." Then they can get their fingerprints on it, feel some sense
      of ownership of the final product. If you do that several times, iterate
      through the project that way, you'll zero in on something that everybody
      can agree on</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: I wonder if your
      programmers have a similar attitude to some rock stars I've worked with,
      who feel that the record companies are corrupt and stupid and they
      wouldn't know what a hit record sounds like if it ran them down. But the
      record producer (or project manager) has to be the person who floats
      <a name="idx-CHP-31-0946"></a>between those two worlds. The record company, they're all
      about the bottom line, the cash, whereas the programmers or the artists
      are all about culture and innovation and art and creativity. The project
      manager has to be the filter between the two worlds, because if the
      programmers communicated directly with the record company, they'd be
      thrown off the balcony. They'd be fired for insolence.</p>
<p class="docText">And if the record company were allowed to
      talk to the artists (the programmers), then the artists would throw them
      off the balcony. You have to understand the way both people's minds
      work. It's definitely a left-side/right-side brain situation, and that's
      where a project manager could really shine with their people skills. As
      I've said, you have to have technical skills. You have to understand the
      programmer's problems. But on the other hand, you have to understand the
      company's bottom-line problems, and what they want to sell to the
      public. So, there you go.</p>
<p class="docText">The second thing I do is I always budget in more than I need. It's
      a little trick of mine. And I book in maybe three extra weeks that I
      probably won't need, and then what I end up doing is I deliver the
      project under budget and early.</p>
<p class="docText">Because I really know deep down inside how long it's going to
      take&mdash;and I've only learnt this from experience, of course. This way, if
      you need those three extra weeks, it's available, and it kind of makes
      everyone breathe a little easier. If you budget just how long it's going
      to take and you have no contingency, then there's no Plan B. You're
      setting yourself up to fail. If you come to that crunch, where the
      client does not like your product and there's no budget left, you have
      failed, and everyone's going to look bad.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, what happens when your team members just
      don't get along? What happens when you've got conflicts? One person
      wants to do it one way, another person wants to do it another way.
      You've got irreconcilable differences, and the clock is ticking and the
      budget is burning</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-31-0947"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Well, if they don't get
      along, that's something that should have been observed in the first
      place. I pick my team members very carefully. I have a lot of people in
      my phone book that I use. I know certain drummers will not get along
      with certain singers, I just know that. For instance, for this new
      project I'm working on, this drummer was recommended, but he was kind
      of, well, I won't say any names, but he was kind of a beer-drinking,
      happy-go-lucky guy who's always telling fart jokes. He plays great
      drums, and all that. But the singer was the complete opposite&mdash;a very
      sensitive person, a person who doesn't like gross people. It would have
      been insane to put those two people on the same job. And this drama
      would be taking the wind out of this performer's sails all the time. So
      even though I like this guy's drumming, he was the wrong drummer for
      this artist. The sessions would have collapsed into a kind of men's
      club, and the artist I'm working with is a very sensitive female.</p>
<p class="docText">I try to pick the team members for personality. Personalities are
      very, very important. So, the personalities have to be right, and of
      course, the style has to be right&mdash;not that everyone has to be in the
      same style, but the styles have to be complementary. It could be a
      yin-yang thing. Maybe that's the right thing to do. Maybe that's the
      wrong thing to do, putting such extreme types, personality types, and
      creativity types together.</p>
<p class="docText">But that has to be worked out, and that's your responsibility as a
      project manager. Learn as much as possible about these potential team
      members. Meet them. Have lunch with them. Have dinner with them. Go out
      with them. Learn about these people. You're going to
      be very, very intimate with them once the project starts, and you don't
      want any surprises. If someone potentially has a temper that's going to
      flare up, if I know that beforehand, then I will expect it to happen.
      But if that suddenly rears its head unexpectedly in the middle of a
      project, if suddenly I'm stuck with a diva, then it's a little too late
      in the game. It's a very awkward situation.</p>
<p class="docText">Do I have to fire this person? Do I have to sit and give him or
      her a lecture? But I should have known in the first place that this was
      going to happen. You have to try to build your team based on whether
      these people will be harmonious. Once it's gone wrong, I think you have
      the ultimate weapon: to fire a team member. And that's not a bad thing.
      That could be a very good thing, because if you get rid of the
      troublemaker, it'll strengthen the team. They'll know that you have the
      courage to do such a thing, and they probably didn't like the person
      anyway. And the next person who comes in is a Johnny-come-lately to the
      team, so he or she will be more obedient, do his or her best to fit
      in.</p>
<p class="docText">So, it's hard when you have different personalities, but if you're
      ready for the worst you can manage it better, a lot better.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Firing people&mdash;that's not a topic a lot of people
      like to talk about</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: You know, firing people
      is inevitable. You have to consider that can happen.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I had a boss once who told me that the only way
      to get a team's respect is to make it clear that you're the boss. In his
      mind, I think that meant asserting his authority, and yelling at people
      until they did what he wanted</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-31-0948"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: You can't yell at people.
      If you yell at people, they don't hear the words, they hear the anger.
      You have to control your anger, and it's really not easy to do. You
      could be angry when you tell the truth, but you can't afford to show it.
      And you have to learn how to take a breath, go out of the room, come
      back in when you've calmed down a bit, and then tell the truth. You
      can't scream at people&mdash;it does not work. It just brings up memories of
      their parents or their teachers or bullies. You can't come off as
      that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: But you do sometimes have a genuine difference
      of opinion, and a decision does have to get made. How do you handle
      that? What if you know things have to go one way, and you know that
      there's somebody you have to work with who just wants to see things go
      another way? What do you do if you know that it will just not work out
      if we keep going in that direction, but the people you're working with
      are just having a lot of trouble even seeing that?</span><a name="idx-CHP-31-0949"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: That's delicate, because
      in my case, sometimes I have to back off every now and then, to realize
      that the artist's name is going to be bigger than mine in the credits.
      My team always contains a "star." Sometimes I have to change; I must
      admit if an idea comes that's not what I had in mind, I have to
      completely examine it and say, "This might not be a bad idea. I could be
      wrong."</p>
<p class="docText">So, I always keep that option open, but if
      I'm dead certain that this is going down the wrong way, I will have to
      remind everyone because every project begins with defining the goals.
      You have such meetings at the beginning of the project. And it should be
      down on paper, and charts, schedules, should be made up. We need to do
      this by that date, and to have a person go off the charts at some late
      stage in the project is really in breach of the contract which makes a
      team cohesive. I'm talking about the social contract of getting the job
      done. And if you had these things written down, you have to remind
      people that they've gone off the page.</p>
<p class="docText">That's very, very important, and that usually reels people back
      in, even the "star." But I do my best to see the difference between a
      frivolous idea and a brilliant idea. And of course, Andrew, if the idea
      is so amazing, you have to say, "I wish this idea came up at the
      beginning. We should spend some time on this." But you can't entertain
      frivolous ideas. It's really out of the question. You have to be very
      firm.</p>
<p class="docText">I'm a chart person. I have charts on the walls. In my studio right
      now, I have every song that we're recording up on a chart. I have
      horizontal columns for the songs, and vertical columns for what needs to
      be done to the songs. And every time an activity is done, it gets a
      mark&mdash;I put a random colored sticky star over the activity, which
      inadvertently turns into a grading system because the artist wants the
      gold stars. It gets kind of playful, too, because I encourage the use of
      the chart as an ideas section; anyone can jot down an idea. It makes
      everyone feel creative, involved, but mainly accountable, as it is
      always visible.</p>
<p class="docText">Everyone can see at any time at what stage we're at in the
      project, not just me. I think it's everyone's business to know how they
      fit into the whole. And my charts have been great for that. The other
      chart is a custom-made calendar from day one to the last day of the
      project, and it is numbered backwards, so the last day is one and the
      next-to-the-last day is two, so everyone can actually visually see what
      day we're in. "Oh, we have 45 days left. We have 42 days left. We have
      three days left." This is the bare visible truth about the
      deadline.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, I do this because I'm in a physical room, and I have these on
      the wall. But you could have an updated, interactive chart on your
      computer desktop that's emailed amongst your team every day, something
      that they open up several times during the day. We refer to our progress
      chart on the average of once an hour. If they're building a video
      game&mdash;"Oh, so Jimmy added the feet to that character, and Sue added a
      <a name="idx-CHP-31-0950"></a>musical theme. OK, now I know what I have to do"&mdash;I really
      believe that a "public" progress chart holds everyone
      accountable.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Is this something that you put up on the wall as
      a one-way communication to the team, or does everyone get involved in
      planning? Is it you talking to the team, or is it everyone talking to
      each other?</span><a name="idx-CHP-31-0951"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: The progress chart starts
      out with all the ideas from the planning meetings. It is not a blank
      page. Everyone is involved with creating it. But as time goes by, I
      encourage everyone on the team to add new ideas that modify the original
      concept for the better.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Tony uses charts like this to keep make sure everyone on
      the team can see what stage the album is at, at any time. How is this
      similar to Mike Cohn's task boards? How is it
      different?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: A lot of people would
      probably be surprised to hear that rock and roll album, this music, is
      made with charts and schedules and goals, writing down goals and
      building schedules. I think people would almost be relieved to find out
      that they're not the only ones who deal with those things, and that
      using a tool like that you can actually produce great art&mdash;and that it
      sometimes helps the creative process, rather than hurting
      it</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-31-0952"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Well, anything that
      involves huge sums of money requires organization, and that includes
      rock and roll. There was a period when there was carte blanche, when Led
      Zeppelin's manager had an actual sculpture made out of cocaine in the
      form of a swan (and added to the recording budget). But those
      indulgences went a long way towards ruining the
      <a name="idx-CHP-31-0953"></a>music business. Now the budgets have to be very
      streamlined and approved in the <a name="idx-CHP-31-0954"></a>music business, because we're competing with video games
      and all kinds of other media. Pop music isn't raking in the kind of huge
      profits we saw two decades ago. Kids have more distractions now.
      Recordings have to be produced efficiently these days, especially rock
      and roll, I'm afraid.</p>
<p class="docText">But it's good. If people ask me, "We have enough money to put you
      in the studio with a group for seven days, what can you give us?" I'll
      tell them honestly, "I can produce four songs to a high level of
      quality." "Oh, but we want an album!" I can negotiate for more time, but
      if they insist on an album of, say, 12 songs, then I'll tell them that
      in that time we can record two songs to a high standard but the rest
      will be a jam, no sophistication. The premier album of the artist Jewel
      [<span class="docEmphasis">Pieces of You</span>] was just such a thing. They blew
      their small budget on the hit single, "Who Will Save Your Soul," and the
      rest of the album was taken mainly from her live performance in a club.
      You can't take a project on without being truthful about what restraints
      the budget will have on it. If you run out of money halfway through,
      there will be a drama and you will get a bad reputation.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, how did you learn this stuff? Clearly you've
      worked out a lot of systems, and know this isn't the sort of thing you
      can learn without making some mistakes. This is definitely the sort of
      thing where you have to have learned this from experience. I'm pretty
      sure that there aren't any books that teach you this
      stuff</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Well, I think it's pretty
      typical of people in their 20s to always want to come off as a cool
      person and as a nice guy, and that blocked me from taking complete
      charge. Eventually I saw that I wasted a lot of time and I allowed bad
      records to be made, because I was afraid to tell the truth.</p>
<p class="docText">Because eventually I grew tired of being, I guess
      <span class="docEmphasis">cowardly</span> is the word I want, and not having the
      <a name="idx-CHP-31-0955"></a>courage to just call it as I see it. Once I did, though, I
      opened up the floodgates. I mean, I couldn't control it after that. I
      then had to learn diplomacy.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: But the charts&mdash;you basically came up with those
      yourself?</span><a name="idx-CHP-31-0956"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: I innovated this chart in
      the '80s. I see a lot of other people using it now, the "public" chart.
      The people on my team were relying on my private notes for what was
      coming next and some were making private notes of their own. I thought,
      why don't we just put all the plans and ideas up on the wall for all to
      see? It worked great the very first time I did this. Now, when I work
      with the same artists again, they expect to see the chart!</p>
<p class="docText">I'm a bit fanatical about charts. I've got the backwards calendar
      that I already told you about. And there's one I have when I do a thing
      called "making a composite of a vocal." Say a singer sings a song seven
      times; I have a horizontal and vertical coordinate chart relating to
      virtually every word that the person sings, so I can cross-reference
      from, say, between eight vocals. After I pick the best-sung lines,
      words, even syllables, I am able to construct the "perfect" vocal.
      Anyone who wants to participate in the vocal comp can have the same
      chart and we compare our choices. I started doing the "comp chart" in
      the early '70s, but now loads of artists and producers use variations of
      this chart.</p>
<p class="docText">I find that these are interactive things that
      really bring the team together. They get really, really keen if they
      feel included in decisions. Still, I have veto power because I am
      ultimately responsible for bringing the project home. The charts I use
      are amazing team tools.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That sounds really effective. It sounds like
      you've figured out a way to bring visibility into the project, and get
      your whole team involved; and it sounds like you need to do it in a way
      that balances out everyone's ego. Actually, it occurs to me that you
      need to deal with a lot of the same personality issues that you'll see
      on a programming team. When you're working with programmers, especially
      superstar programmers, sometimes the best people on your team are also
      some of the most socially awkward people on your team. They're not going
      to respect you unless you make it clear that you deserve their respect.
      Does that sound like some sort of situation you've had to deal
      with?</span><a name="idx-CHP-31-0957"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: The human mind works in
      strange ways, and highly creative people generally have bad social
      skills because a lot of the brain is involved in being highly creative.
      They don't observe the effect that their impetuous outbursts have on
      other people, how they are alienating themselves from the rest. They
      don't see that. It is a social problem, but it's not very different from
      a young child who is very, very selfish. I'm not trying to make fun of
      creative people, but often, emotionally they haven't progressed much
      further than that in their social skills.</p>
<p class="docText">Often it becomes all about them, and like a lot of young kids,
      they need reassurance that you love them. That's really what this is
      about. It's a cry asking, "Do you love me?" That's what they want to
      hear you say. Now, of course, we're all adults, so you can't go around
      saying all the time, "I love you, Jim." You have to show it in other
      ways; you should make your appreciation quite overt. It might mean
      addressing Jim first in a meeting. You might have a group of them in the
      room; you say, "Let's discuss the next stage. I'd like to know how you
      all feel about it&mdash;Jim?" Jim might not have anything to say in that
      moment, but he'll notice he was the first to be consulted.</p>
<p class="docText">I probably sound arrogant, but as a father, I've learned to deal
      with children and divas. Every band I've worked with have sober,
      mature-thinking members and one or two diva-like personalities. There is
      a pecking order; it naturally forms as it does in all forms of social
      interaction. In a successful team we've all learned that we wouldn't be
      a team without our "star." Fortunately, a real smart "star" knows that
      they'd find it very hard to succeed, or even survive, without a great
      team.</p>
<p class="docText">I am a well-known record producer, but I can't afford the luxury
      of being a "star" myself. I have to be the soberest member of the team
      and lead my group of mavericks on into glorious victory.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: You know, I recognize some of that in myself.
      Early on in my career, when I was the top programmer on a small team, I
      acted like a prima donna. It was all about me. And I wonder if I would
      have gotten along better with the people around me if I'd said to
      myself, "You know what? I am a little bit overdemanding. I get impatient
      with people and I'm demanding, but I produce and they put up with me
      because I produce." What advice could you give
      people who are like that early-career version of me, advice that might
      make dealing with others a little easier?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: I think they have to
      learn about the impact it has on the rest of the team, by being petulant
      and selfish. Even the most understanding people on the team will take
      only so much childish behavior.</p>
<p class="docText">And the programmer must realize that he might be a great
      programmer, but in a world of billions of people, there are other great
      programmers who will gladly fill his vacant seat after the mutiny. In
      this big resourceful world of talent, any team member could be replaced.
      Everyone has the responsibility to learn how to get along with each
      other, even the "stars."</p>
<p class="docText">You're in competition with other A teams; there's always
      competition. You cannot afford to have internal squabbling. You cannot
      have infighting to the point where one individual is destroying the
      morale and the productivity of the team. Someone who's got a better
      attitude will replace you. Everyone's replaceable.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Before we finish this off, do you have any
      advice for somebody who is a good musician, or somebody who's a good
      programmer, or somebody who's good at whatever job they do? Someone who
      sees the next step in their career is going towards what you do, going
      towards leading a team or managing a team or making sure work gets done
      well? What advice would you give them?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tony</span>: Well, nowadays there are
      so many distractions, and it's really, really hard to concentrate given
      what we are exposed to. My motto for musicians who make music on the
      computer, for instance, is that computer skills aren't really that
      difficult to attain&mdash;compared to real musical skills. A smart 8-year-old
      can work Garage Band; it's no big deal dragging a loop into a space and
      another loop into another space and all that. My motto is "Put down the
      mouse and pick up a guitar." We're in danger of losing the ability to
      concentrate on mastering something. Nowadays the temptation is so great
      to just get lost in skateboarding, video games, drinking&mdash;a lot of people
      start drinking too heavily, too early now. But the greatest musicians
      that have ever lived have spent a long time learning, practicing, and
      perfecting what they did.</p>
<p class="docText">And I think that even though you reached a certain level&mdash;like
      there's a lot of young musicians who can play 12 chords and they think,
      well, that's all I need. My advice is that the more you know and the
      more you study, you'll have a better chance at succeeding in life.
      That's it. So devote your downtime, devote it to learning more stuff.
      I'm still learning new stuff to make better productions.</p>
