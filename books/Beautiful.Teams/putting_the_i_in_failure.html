<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jennifer Greene</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">THE SUMMARY LINE ON MY RESUME SAYS THIS:
      "JENNY GREENE IS AN EXPERIENCED PROJECT AND</span> development
      manager with a track record of successful projects and teams." And it's
      true, I've managed a bunch of teams that have been able to create the
      software they were paid to build on time, within budget, and with
      quality. I'd bet that a lot of people out there could make the same
      claim. But when I look back over the work I've done over the past 15
      years or so, I know that a number of those successful projects didn't
      lead to market dominance for the companies I worked for. In some cases,
      they didn't even solve the problem they were meant to solve. And pretty
      much everything I've read tells me that I'm not alone. A lot of projects
      do much worse than the ones I've worked on. Some published estimates put
      the <a name="idx-CHP-10-0270"></a>failure rate as high as 80% of all software
      projects.</p>
<p class="docText">A few years ago, Andrew and I started traveling around to
      networking events and conferences giving a talk called "Why Projects
      Fail." The point of the presentation is to help people make the
      connection between practices that they might dismiss as heavy or
      difficult (like code reviews and estimation) and avoiding common
      pitfalls. We expected it to be a bit irreverent and lively because we
      tried to use some of the stuff we'd learned in writing Head First books
      to keep the mood light. And we got what we expected&mdash;but more than
      that, we struck a chord with people who seemed to
      be dying to talk about the mistakes they'd made on their projects. I
      mean, a lot of people want to know, "Really. Why
      <span class="docEmphasis">did</span> my project fail?" More often than not, the
      talks turned into an opportunity for people to vent: to tell us their
      war stories about this insane decision from management, or that terrible
      programmer who was too egotistical to fix his own code, or that product
      that was just a bad idea from the start. In front of the audience, we'd
      always try to turn the conversation around to a particular practice that
      could help out ("If you've got problems with quality, do code reviews
      upfront" or "You're always missing your deadlines? Use a consensus-based
      estimation process like Wideband Delphi"). Those practices have helped
      both Andrew and me immensely in our careers. But practices won't solve
      interpersonal problems or make sure that the project you're working on
      is the right one for your company. They won't guarantee success. And
      away from the audience, we talked about that a lot.</p>
<p class="docText">I've worked with companies where the need to produce software on a
      regular basis was so encompassing that they'd lost track of the
      <a name="idx-CHP-10-0271"></a>reasons behind that software. Places where people spent
      tons of money building stuff just to prove that they have a product.
      I've seen projects get funding without much understanding of what
      they'll produce, and I've been managed by insecure people who turn the
      screws on the team to hit crazy deadlines for projects that are really
      not important in the scheme of things. I've worked nights and weekends
      and given up vacations for products that have barely been used. I know
      what it feels like to work on a delivery team when your goals are
      constantly changing and there's no guarantee that what you're building
      will ever be useful to anybody. Are you successful if you build that
      useless product on time? Are you successful if you keep a team together
      under conditions like that? Frankly, it's tough to be objectively
      successful in that situation. The best you can do is work to challenge
      the need for those deadlines. Fight to give people a more reasonable set
      of goals, and sometimes that's a fight you can't win.</p>
<p class="docText">Some of the best teams I've worked with have been in impossible
      situations and some of the best work I've done hasn't contributed to
      objective success. It's the people who stick with you, and sometimes
      those impossible situations, that bring out some really innovative
      thought. When I was new to New York and still pretty early in my career,
      I joined the team that'll probably stick with me as one of the most
      hard-working and genuine groups of people I'll ever work with.</p>
<p class="docText">"At Gabfest Software, we think that getting a bunch of really
      smart people together and putting them in a room with a really tough
      problem can lead to magical results."</p>
<p class="docText">I remember the excited look on the CTO's face as he said those
      words. He was really enthusiastic about the work that they were doing,
      and it was disarming. I was interviewing for a job as a QA manager at a
      small start-up company that was doing amazing things. This company was
      going to change the way people interacted with computers: it was going
      to get computers to understand the way people talk. This informal chat
      came after a full day of meeting half the company and answering more
      traditional interview questions. He took me to the coffee shop next door
      to the office and began to sell me on his vision of the company and its
      future. When he said that bit about smart people and tough problems it
      seemed not just reasonable, but actually inspiring. Smart people can do
      anything, right?</p>
<p class="docText">At the time I thought I was pretty smart. And
      after spending two years testing internal software for a really
      conservative financial company, I was ready to try to tackle more
      significant problems. So, I left that company and prepared to start
      fighting the good fight.</p>
<p class="docText">My background was about as far from natural language processing as
      it gets. The company I'd just come from, Gridline, was a small company
      that built financial software that tracked stocks. They'd hired me after
      I moved to New York City (I'd just spent a few years at an online
      service testing C++ client software). The job at Gridline was great, but
      a little stuffy. It was the kind of place where casual Friday meant
      "business casual." Everybody wore suits and ties every day, the culture
      was sales-driven, and most of the team had been in finance for a long
      time.</p>
<p class="docText">Gridline was small. The executive team was filled with people
      who'd been there since the company was founded. They took pride in the
      company's success and felt a kind of loyalty to its founder that I
      haven't really experienced anywhere else I've worked. Many of the people
      who worked there stayed in the same job for years and years. I joined
      the company as a QA manager testing their internal data scrubbing
      applications. I was there for about two years and I really enjoyed the
      work. I hired and trained the test team from scratch, and documented and
      built the first versions of their development process. That had a big
      impact on the quality of the work they were doing. When the test team
      was built, I started taking on more and more responsibility. But I
      didn't see my paycheck growing along with the challenges. Eventually, it
      dawned on me that I could probably do better by looking for a new job.
      The dot-com boom was in full swing, and anybody who knew anything about
      computers had absolutely no trouble finding a good job.</p>
<p class="docText">When I took the elevator up to the Gabfest offices, I was amazed
      that it seemed to be the absolute opposite of the job I was leaving.
      There was no security desk to pass when you entered the building, no
      receptionist, no fancy lobby. Not one person in the office was wearing a
      suit or a tie. The whole office was set up as one big room full of
      tables. Everyone sat together with no cubicle walls and no privacy at
      all. I thought of the fights I'd been through when we were remodeling
      the offices at Gridline. The office furniture there conveyed your
      status; small cubes for the entry level and temporary employees, big
      cubes for those who'd been around for a few years, small offices with
      Formica desks for managers and supervisors, and big offices with real
      wooden desks for directors, VPs, and higher. We had endless
      conversations about who would sit where and what level should get what
      kind of office furniture. All of that stuff meant so much to everyone at
      Gridline. The people who worked in cubes took it very seriously that one
      day they might make it into an actual office, and the execs were really
      proud of their wooden furniture. I knew my place: Formica office with
      about five years of toeing the line to get to finished wood furniture.
      But Gabfest's office made it clear that nobody cared about any of that
      crap. We were all there to get the work done together. After two years
      of watching people fight over offices and titles and responsibilities, I
      was ready for a job that was all about the work.</p>
<p class="docText">A lot of people have written about the excesses of the dot-com
      boom, and now that I've read about the other start-ups in that time, I
      feel like I got the short end of the stick when it came to amenities.
      There was no foosball table, no massage therapist on staff, no
      organic food chef, or free lunch. It was just a big
      room full of people working really, really hard on some impossible
      problems.</p>
<p class="docText">They were building a product that I still don't fully understand
      today. A group of computational linguists had created a language
      processing engine that took phrases that were typed in by users and
      modeled out responses based on a deep understanding of the domain they
      were discussing. The first product they built knew everything there was
      to know about laptops. If you typed in "I want a fast, cheap laptop that
      weighs under 5 pounds" it would turn that into a SQL query and return
      the laptops from a database that fit your specifications. These programs
      would be packaged up and sold to websites that wanted to provide a more
      personal shopping experience for their users but didn't want to hire
      people to sit and talk to them.</p>
<p class="docText">The work began with one of the senior employees in the company. He
      led the team of linguists and had built the prototype the software was
      based on before the company was even formed. He was really dedicated to
      the software he'd built, and constantly interested in making it better.
      But he wasn't sold on the idea that it would ever be a commercially
      viable product. In retrospect, that probably should've been a red flag
      for everybody working there. But we all really liked our jobs. I mean,
      we all really liked the work we were doing in the meantime, so it made
      the direction and overall goal of the product less important.</p>
<p class="docText">I instantly liked the people I met. They were smart and funny,
      most with impressive educations and completely dedicated to their work.
      The software, for the most part, worked. As long as you confined your
      conversations to laptops, it was a pretty helpful sales tool. The group
      had focused on the quality of the software from the very beginning.
      Along with the product, they'd built an automated test tool to catch
      defects as early in the development process as possible. There was a
      sense that the people working there were so dedicated to the problem
      they were solving that they were really doing their best every day to
      expand its capabilities.</p>
<p class="docText">In retrospect, there were a lot of problems with the software we
      were building&mdash;and not necessarily technical ones. For instance, we've
      learned a lot about how to sell people laptops over the Internet, and
      it's pretty obvious that people don't shop the way Gabfest wanted them
      to. If you want to buy a laptop online, most companies that sell them
      have configuration tools that let you select the features you want from
      a list of what they offer. When you think about it, an interface like
      that is probably a lot more direct than the tool we were building. Let's
      face it: most people don't want to have conversations about laptops with
      natural language processing (NLP) engines just to narrow down the six or
      seven optional features they can choose from. But it was still a really
      interesting problem for linguists to solve, and one that it was possible
      to get funding for back then.</p>
<p class="docText">I worked really hard while I was there. Whenever there was a demo
      or a business development deal in the works, I would put in ridiculous
      hours making sure that everything worked correctly. I remember putting
      in overnights and weekends on an almost routine basis. Everybody did.
      You could rely on everyone there to do his or her part in a way that
      I haven't really seen since. I was responsible for
      starting to gather metrics on the way the product was behaving, tracking
      down some nasty bugs and planning out the work of the rest of the QA
      team to hit some aggressive delivery deadlines. Because the testing
      itself was automated from the start, I needed to figure out the best way
      to evaluate all of the test results and track them over time. I started
      to find habitual problems with the development process and worked with
      the team to correct them. That work was interesting for me and it's
      where I started to piece together some of the practices that would make
      such a difference in the way I managed development teams going
      forward.</p>
<p class="docText">I had the freedom to make any suggestion I thought might help our
      products directly to the CTO, the development leads, and the developers
      themselves. I was able to suggest changes and see their impacts right
      away. We argued and discussed every change we made before we implemented
      it, but people were open minded and would try most ideas that had merit.
      I trusted the people I worked with, and they trusted me, so all in all,
      it really worked. After working in some pretty political places, having
      that kind of access to the decision makers was a welcome change.</p>
<p class="docText">But as rewarding as the work was, there were some major problems,
      too. Alongside the natural language projects were some AI projects that
      were being developed without buy-in from the linguistics teams. We also
      had a data mining team that was spinning up to track the conversations
      live users would have with the software when it went live. There were
      often heated battles about whether it made sense for us to focus on all
      of those goals at once.</p>
<p class="docText">As the company went on, the three groups of people really emerged
      as almost warring factions. Everyone believed really strongly in their
      own cause, and honestly believed that they were going to be the
      difference between success and <a name="idx-CHP-10-0272"></a>failure for Gabfest when it finally hit the marketplace.
      There were the computational linguists. They fought to make the NLP
      engine as good as possible, expanding its vocabulary and its knowledge
      domain. There was no real end point. There are an unlimited number of
      ways you can express an idea, even an idea as simple as "I want a fast
      laptop." They knew their engine would never be as smart as a human
      being, but they also knew that people wouldn't trust it to work properly
      if it didn't understand "I want my laptop to be fast" to mean the same
      thing as "I don't want a slow laptop." It seems like an easy problem to
      describe (for anyone who hasn't really worked with it), but it turns out
      to be a deviously difficult linguistic problem to solve. And that's what
      the computational linguists were doing. They felt that the richer the
      engine was, the better the product would be in the end.</p>
<p class="docText">Then there were the artificial intelligence people. They wanted
      the software to be able to learn new vocabulary and even new behaviors
      and ideas from the people who were talking to it. Their work wasn't
      nearly as far along as the linguists'&mdash;they were trying to tack their
      functionaly onto an already working language processor. But what it
      lacked in vision, it made up for in cool factor. Everyone loved this
      idea. They wanted the software to get smarter and smarter, not because
      people were working on it, but just because they were talking to
      it.</p>
<p class="docText">If the company had been pulled in only two
      directions, by the linguists and the AI folks, it might have turned out
      differently. But there was a third faction who had their own goal for
      the company: data mining. They wanted the software to go through all of
      the conversations it had had with all of its users, and use that
      information to target advertising to specific users based on their
      profiles and current conversations. Everyone had an intuitive feeling
      that there was a lot of potential profit there. But we were all
      worried&mdash;even the data mining proponents&mdash;about the possible privacy
      issues that this raised. But it was one of the big selling points of the
      product. Gabfest's clients were pitched the idea that they would learn a
      lot more about their own customers based on their conversations with the
      software.</p>
<p class="docText">That was the three-way battle in a nutshell. The linguists
      basically thought, "None of this works if our stuff doesn't work." The
      AI people had a goal that wasn't well thought out, but everyone felt it
      was worth pursuing just because it was so cool. The data mining people
      considered themselves a profit center for the company. The problem was
      that we weren't big enough to do all three things well. And as smart as
      we were, these were very, very tough goals. We all had a sense that as a
      company we were trying to focus on too many problems at the same time.
      But that was part of the vision for what would make our product
      successful. But we didn't, and the leadership encouraged all three
      factions to go in their own separate directions.</p>
<p class="docText">What we ended up with was a bunch of almost "covert" projects
      happening simultaneously. The AI people built lots of prototype neural
      networks, but didn't really add anything to the main product. The
      computational linguists kept adding functionality to the existing
      product, even though its sales were still struggling to take off. And
      this, to me, was the real story of the dot-com boom: it wasn't about
      foosball tables, flexible hours, wacky job titles, open office plans,
      free food, or even the rise and fall of venture capitalists. It was
      about people being given more free reign to take bigger risks and do
      more interesting work than they could have imagined. It was a time when
      we were really encouraged to be creative. And for us, that meant doing
      real, cutting-edge linguistics and artificial intelligence research and
      trying to come up with a real business model out of it.</p>
<p class="docText">Everyone kept working on their own thing. But as things
      progressed, we had a lot of trouble coming up with a single cohesive
      product. I think most of us knew this, but wanted to ride it out because
      each and every one of us was learning something, and it was the most fun
      job any of us had ever had. In a way, we all got to choose our own
      adventure, and we were all rewarded by it&mdash;not just with paychecks, but
      in our careers. Every single person I worked with at Gabfest was better
      off for being part of it. But everyone did feel very strongly about
      their opinions, and the value of the work they were doing. Each person
      tried to exert as much influence as possible over where the company was
      going. There were a lot of knock-down, drag-out fights, sitting in
      conference rooms screaming at each other about where the company was
      headed.</p>
<p class="docText">Then one Tuesday afternoon the CTO told us we'd run out of money
      and the company was going to dissolve in two weeks.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember the night the announcement was
      made that we all sort of hung around talking to each other about what
      we'd do, for hours afterward. We opened beers, sat around and hung out,
      and for the first time in a long time we had a relaxing night. The
      fights didn't matter anymore. There was no more goal for the company. We
      shifted to being just people who'd gone through something traumatic
      together.</p>
<p class="docText">Then something weird happened. The last two weeks that the company
      was in existence, everyone who worked there showed up every day as if
      nothing had changed. We just kept working to try to preserve as much of
      the product as we could. Nobody even questioned it. We were there
      working 12-hour days, even though we knew we'd be out of work in two
      weeks. Every single person cared so much about the work they were doing
      that it didn't matter what would happen to the company. We had a new
      goal: get everything archived so that we could pick up the work again
      someday. And in a way, I believe that every one of us thought that would
      really happen.</p>
<p class="docText">Even afterward, we helped each other get jobs. We were all
      references for each other. One of my friends was eight months pregnant
      at the time of the company closing, and the whole company came together
      even after we'd disbanded to throw her a baby shower, chipping in money
      to get gifts for her. In the months and years after, we've all stayed in
      touch. Even more than a year later we were getting together. As
      ill-fated as the original idea was, we were all so engaged in our pieces
      of it that I think we all think back on the experience and the
      relationships fondly. We were bonded by that company. I'd happily pick
      up the phone and give a glowing reference for pretty much everyone I
      worked with there. There isn't another company I've worked with that I
      could say the same about.</p>
<p class="docText">I know I've never worked with a team before or since that was so
      singularly dedicated to their work. They're still an inspiration to me.
      But the truth is that it takes a lot more than smarts, gumption, and
      money to solve big problems. First it takes a unified, viable goal. We
      didn't commercialize natural language processing, or build products that
      made the web shopping experience much more <a name="idx-CHP-10-0273"></a>personal for everybody. We didn't revolutionize the way
      people communicate with computers. But the work we did at Gabfest did
      result in something sort of magical.</p>
<p class="docText">Despite the industry's disturbing track record for failed
      projects, nearly everybody's resumes are full of sentences like the one
      I quoted earlier. In my case, this particular <a name="idx-CHP-10-0274"></a>failure was worth a lot more than many of the successes
      I've had since. Would I consider my part in this successful? On a
      personal level, definitely. I grew immensely as a result. But
      objectively, the company and its products didn't succeed. As far as I
      know, our archived software never got dusted off. I know that we were
      smart enough and skilled enough to build any software we wanted to&mdash;the
      team at Gabfest was easily the smartest group of people I've ever worked
      with. But I've seen much less skilled people make an awful lot of money

      and they got it to customers who would buy it.</p>
<p class="docText">In general, none of us seem to think that the
      failures we've lived and worked through are ever our fault. And I don't
      necessarily think that's a bad thing. I guess I don't think that the
      failure I've lived and worked through is my fault, either.</p>
