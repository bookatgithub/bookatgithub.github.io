<p class="docText">Johnny was an expert in the system. He was the designer and
        programmer on the original system years earlier. During my work on the
        project, his role was systems engineer. From his vast knowledge of the
        system, he wrote the requirements spec. We worked together to extract
        the names of the use cases implied by the requirements. Johnny would
        elaborate the requirements just in time for us to design and implement
        them. Johnny was always under pressure to deliver the next batch of
        use cases. Sometimes it took him longer to figure out the use cases
        than it took for us to implement them. That always upset him. It was
        working quite well. I really came to appreciate having an on-site
        customer.<a name="idx-CHP-15-0417"></a></p>
<p class="docText">One day, Johnny, Paul, and I had finished reviewing the use
        cases and went to start the development work. We worked out the impact
        of the new use case on the existing design. We used a high-tech tool
        known as a whiteboard. The system design was in our heads, so we
        extracted enough of the design, putting it on the whiteboard, and
        talked through the changes. Once we were happy with our direction,
        Paul and I went to Paul's cube to get started.</p>
<p class="docText">Within minutes of starting, we had a problem. We read the
        detailed use case again. There was an area of interpretation. We had
        just discussed it with Johnny a half hour before, but Paul said,
        "Johnny said we should retry the transaction under these conditions."
        I said, "No, in this case, we are supposed to log a message and
        continue. You're thinking about use case extension 4B; that's next
        week's work."</p>
<p class="docText">Of course, we discussed it (argued civilly about it) for 20
        minutes. Then it dawned on me. We don't have to guess. We have an
        on-site customer. "Let's ask Johnny." I popped my head up over the
        cube walls. There was Johnny in his office with the door open 5 yards
        away. I'm surprised he did not hear us. Johnny settled the discussion
        in less than a minute. No emails were needed. No voice mails were left
        unanswered. No requirements review cycles were spun. We asked Johnny,
        he settled it, and we got back to work.</p>
<p class="docText">Some might say we needed a better spec; others would add that
        the use cases needed more detail. The documents would have been great
        to have, but I don't think that effort would have helped or have been
        cost-effective. The document would never be detailed enough
        and usable enough where we would not need clarifications from our
        customer. The only form of requirement that has all the details is
        code.</p>
<p class="docText">There were other occasions where we needed clarification on the
        requirements. Many times Johnny asked for time to go off and study the
        existing code base. The legacy application that we were redesigning a
        part of was our de facto requirements document. It was the only
        document detailed enough to answer some of our nitty-gritty
        requirements questions. If all those nitty-gritty requirements had
        made it into a document, that document would have been as detailed as
        the code and probably not too helpful.</p>
