<p class="docText">The area that Michael Collins works in interests us for two
        reasons. First, Michael spent much of his career working on <a name="idx-CHP-22-0709"></a>research with teams in an academic setting. But second,
        that research has been oriented at solving concrete, real-word
        security problems for serious customers inside and outside government,
        and the work that he's done spans both academic and commercial areas.
        We wanted to hear what he had to say about that.</p>
</td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: You were working on a
      research project to try to detect intrusions into
      networks</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-22-0710"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: Mostly what we were
      trying to do was model normalcy. Most of what I do falls into the field
      of <a name="idx-CHP-22-0711"></a>anomaly detection, which falls under the field of
      <a name="idx-CHP-22-0712"></a>intrusion detection. Most anomaly detection is trying to
      build a model of normal behavior, so when you see that all of a sudden
      you're falling outside the domain of normal behavior, you get curious as
      to why that's happening.</p>
<p class="docText">A credit card example of this is that you've got normal spending
      habits. And if all of a sudden you start spending in Katmandu, that's
      when the credit card company calls up and asks, "Are you in Katmandu?"
      And the answer is no. That's anomaly detection, as done with credit
      cards. You do the same thing with network traffic.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, your goal was to look at the data from
      routers, and just by looking at the gigabytes of daily data from router
      logs you can detect successful and unsuccessful attempts at
      intrusion?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: That's the Holy Grail.
      But the first step was just to model what was going on. But to do that,
      you don't know the types of questions you're going to ask. And this is
      the cornerstone of research: you don't really know what you will need
      yet. Oftentimes, you build and rebuild your tools all the way through
      the process.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, the client at this point could conduct one query every five
      hours or so. It was something in the nature that they were literally
      conducting the query of the day. They'd put up the graph and say, "This
      is what we found today." We got that time down from five or six hours to
      about 10 minutes on a dual-processor Pentium box (in 2001). We put out
      our initial report, which led to the question, "How are you able to do
      that many queries?" We came up with our explanation as to how we'd
      shrunk down the data and formalized the query process. And the response
      from the client was, "We want that."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And suddenly you have a software
      project</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: Exactly.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And you need a team to build
      it</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: Yes. Our original
      group was four people. Two of us were doing code, and neither of us were
      considered "programmers." Specifically, the one time I referred to
      myself as a programmer, my boss, Suresh, yelled at me for about five
      minutes and said, "You might do woodworking, but you're not a carpenter.
      You're a researcher. You write code to answer questions, you're not a
      developer."</p>
<p class="docText">Let me make a couple of points here. We'd actually already
      prepared the environment for tough work, for lack of a better term. So,
      our file type headers, for example, already had a versioning system
      built into them. We'd been prepping for forward and backward
      compatibility.</p>
<p class="docText">We'd had enough experience with engineering environments to know
      that prototypes are something of a luxury, in the sense that the
      difference between your prototype and your production may sometimes be
      that you simply changed the label on it. So, we were not expecting
      the reaction we got, but we also treated the development of the
      <a name="idx-CHP-22-0713"></a>system as a serious problem from square one.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: One thing I've seen when doing research projects
      and talking to people who've done research projects is that, like your
      boss Suresh said, researchers are not programmers. If you were talking
      to someone who's just starting their Ph.D. research or starting a
      research project in a university environment, how would they apply the
      lessons you learned to their own project? What did you do differently
      that a more na&iuml;ve research team might not think to
      do</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-22-0714"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: I think one of the big
      things&mdash;and this is very true, especially of grad students&mdash;is that
      there's a tendency to build a lot of stuff out of spit and bailing wire
      without necessarily thinking about the solution ahead of time.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the big things that we did was that we tried to chop the
      work into discrete, tiny, well-defined "project-ettes." And one of the
      major reasons for doing this was to make sure that the code in
      project-ettes was robust. When you get to the architecture of
      SiLK<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-22-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> (the name of the system we were building), there's kind of
      a core library that manages reading files, I/O, a lot of this stuff. And
      then there are about 40 applications that have been written at this
      point.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-22-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> SiLK, the System for Internet-Level Knowledge, is the
          collection of traffic analysis tools that Michael and the team were
          working on. It's been released as an open source project, and it can
          be downloaded from <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/"></a>.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Research has a very high failure rate. So, the ideal is that as
      long as we kept the development effort involved in these tiny projects,
      which we could then test, see if they were useful, see if they answered
      a question, and if they didn't, they went away. We expected to expend
      time, but at least this way we weren't expending huge amounts of time.
      The stuff that really mattered got folded into the central SiLK library.
      One of the key things was that because we spent a lot of time worrying
      about versioning, and making sure that the central library was robust, I
      think we saved ourselves from the headaches you usually see with
      research projects where you end up with this blob of software that keeps
      expanding all the time. I think that's because when you do research, you
      slap in things an awful lot. You're going to have an idea, you're going
      to try out that idea, and hope that idea becomes useful. We were
      actually fairly ruthless about cutting off things that didn't work and
      acknowledging when we had failures. We also spent a lot of time
      rebuilding and keeping the central core of the system small and
      robust.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, it sounds like there's an architecture
      perspective, where basically you keep it to the scope, acknowledge that
      something didn't work. And when it doesn't work, you get rid of it, you
      get it out of your solution so you don't end up with a lot of cruft over
      time that makes it harder and harder to maintain your
      code</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: Right. The difference
      between research and <a name="idx-CHP-22-0715"></a>feature creep can be really, really fine.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the things we also did as time passed:
      let's say that tool X did something, but later tool Y did something that
      X did, but better. Then we would try to deprecate and remove tool X.
      Now, it turned out that since the system was being used live, that some
      people at the client would stay with tool X. But it no longer became a
      high-priority development task for us. One of the key things attached to
      this, because people were using the live system, was that there was a
      lot of documentation associated with it: there's training, there's
      manuals, there's meetings. And there kind of became a training course
      and training manual that defined how someone used the system. As we
      deprecated a tool, we would remove it from the main part of the training
      course and put it into the back section.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, there's the tools and the architecture, and
      that's one area where you tried to optimize what you did towards
      building software. You changed the way you did your work in order to
      keep it more maintainable. What about the way you worked together? The
      people aspect of it? Did you feel like you had to do something
      differently from the way a lot of research projects were? Is it
      something you guys gave a lot of thought to? An environment that would
      evolve over time?</span><a name="idx-CHP-22-0716"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: Well, that was an
      interesting problem, because we ran into some interesting skills
      stovepiping issues. You had a couple of people who were researchers,
      primarily from statistical or higher-level software engineering
      backgrounds, who really don't know code. And then you had people who
      were hired primarily as developers. But our ideal was to find people who
      sat in the middle: if you could do statistical analysis, and you could
      write C code to do numerical analysis, then that was what we were
      looking for on the whole. And part of the reason was because it's easier
      to justify a researcher than a coder in our line of work. So, our goal
      eventually was to have everyone as a kind of semiautonomous
      coder/researcher, with a couple of people who basically were "guardians"
      of the architecture. It didn't really work out that way in the long run.
      I think the stovepiping ends up being inevitable, simply because people
      have specialties and interests and <a name="idx-CHP-22-0717"></a>skill sets.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the problems we ran into early on was with a senior
      researcher who was explicitly <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> a coder. So, if
      he ran into a problem and there was nobody around to write code for him,
      he had to basically sit around and twiddle his thumbs, and that was a
      running problem we had to figure out how to address. Eventually, we
      ended up getting utility developers who would work with people like him
      and give them the code they need.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, you've got this problem to solve, where
      you've got some of your team members&mdash;pure researchers, scientists,
      mathematicians, statistical analysts&mdash;who aren't coders. In a software
      company, what you'll see a lot of times is that you'll have a team
      working with business clients. But in this case, those non-programmers
      were really part and parcel of the team</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: Yes. We ran into a
      different <a name="idx-CHP-22-0718"></a>requirements <a name="idx-CHP-22-0719"></a>extraction problem. The researchers served as the engine
      for new ideas. That's part of the reason we were looking for hybrid
      researcher-developers. These were people who'd have a problem, they'd go
      build a tool to solve the problem, and the tool would have to be viable
      in multiple situations. And we then had a couple of people who tried to
      figure how to take what had been built and plug it
      into the entire system. So, you'd have these prototypes the <a name="idx-CHP-22-0720"></a>researcher-developers would build, and you'd have a couple
      <a name="idx-CHP-22-0721"></a>of people in the back thinking about how this would go
      into the architecture. One person would think about how to plug things
      into libraries, and I'd think about where we were generally moving:
      here's our gaps in what we've done so far, here's a place where we can
      probably plug those gaps. We've got these tools, so how about we expand
      the functionality of these tools to do this additional stuff, and now
      we've got a coherent view of the problem.</p>
<p class="docText">The advantage was that as we did more and more of those things,
      the pure researchers would not be writing C code, but they might be
      doing scripting or something like that to plug the tools together. Then,
      we'd have a solution&mdash;a slow one&mdash;and we could use something better here.
      So, then we could devote some development effort into developing an
      optimized version of it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So since, at the core of this, this was a
      project to build software as much as it was a research project, the team
      members who normally might not have been coders were contributing
      something codewise in a way that hopefully connected some dots to help
      move on to the next interesting research question</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-22-0722"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: Right. The idea there
      was to reach a middle ground. First off, you'd never expect a pure
      researcher to contribute to the code base. But if we have a collection
      of tools, and a researcher could write a shell script to use the tools,
      that's not onerous to him and it's not destructive to us. It's something
      where he can go forward and come up with an initial answer to the
      question, and we can use that information to say, "Now it's time to
      build system X."</p>
<p class="docText">Again, we're getting to that idea that we don't know if what we're
      producing is going to be valued.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: How often did you find yourself going down false
      paths that required you to remove code from the software? Because when
      you pull features out or change code, you often end up introducing as
      many problems as you solve.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: The way we avoided
      that was that SiLK had two layers. There's the architecture&mdash;the
      filesystem, the file storage, things of that nature&mdash;and then there were
      the tools around it. Research, from SiLK's perspective, consisted of
      either implementing or gluing together a set of tools to answer a
      question. As a rule, the research orbited the tools. If we came up with
      an idea, and we implemented it as a tool, no harm, no foul to the
      central architecture.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: From an architecture perspective, you made
      things highly modular, to the point where you had different programs
      glued together with shell scripts, which is about as modular as
      possible. And from a team perspective, you tried to make sure that
      people were, from a technical perspective, as flexible as possible
      technically</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: Yes. That said, we did
      end up with somebody who became the guardian of the architecture, and
      that's a technical job.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Did you ever run into any
      conflicts between people on the team?</span><a name="idx-CHP-22-0723"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Michael</span>: The <a name="idx-CHP-22-0724"></a>research group was composed of strong-willed, largely
      autonomous people who were drawing in their own funding. Argument was
      the default state of affairs.</p>
<p class="docText">Basically, arguments fell into two categories. The first category
      of arguments are research arguments: I should try idea X, I should try
      idea Y, I should try idea Z. As a rule of thumb, you'd try out the idea,
      and if it turned out to be fine, you went with it. If it didn't work
      out, you didn't. However, we were also producing things that did go to
      the client. We did all of the prototyping with our tools, and if our
      tools turned out to be useful, we'd produce a module and a training
      course, and we'd teach people to use the tools. And one thing I'd do is
      elicit requirements from people who used the tools, because they usually
      had a better idea of what they were looking for than we did. We were
      using the tools for research; they were using them to actually find
      people!</p>
<p class="docText">So, we had that class of arguments. And the other arguments we had
      were about things like the integrity of the code base, things of that
      nature. There was a spectacular, legendary argument that Suresh and I
      had, and this was more a vanity thing on his part. He'd been in jury
      duty for two weeks. He was coming out, and we were going to ship
      something, Goddamn it. Basically, I refused to let that happen until I
      had tested things. The reason for this was that at this point in time,
      we hadn't yet coalesced into having the guy who was the guardian of the
      code base. And one of the things I specifically was brought on to do was
      to be the system reliability guru. I was the guy who worked out all of
      the fault trees for how everything failed, and I wrote documents
      describing to the sys admins how to use these things so if the system
      fails in fashion X, here's how to handle that kind of recovery. So, I
      wasn't letting anything out. It was a four-hour argument, and basically
      boiled down to me sticking to my guns. That was a major thing for me,
      because by that point I'd always been junior to him. This was the point
      where I had taken ownership of the project sufficiently that I wasn't
      going to let my name be damaged, because quite frankly, he'd been in
      jury duty and was feeling salty.</p>
<p class="docText">The key part of that, really, is just that when you're an
      academic, reputation tends to be a big item. When you write a paper, you
      bet your name on the paper. And that was one of the key things about
      this: we had a culture that was generally dedicated to the idea that
      when we put something out, that was our reputation on the line. That was
      taught to everyone within the group. You're representing us, your work
      represents us, and when something goes wrong you have to own up to it,
      fix it, and be cautious about releasing things.</p>
<p class="docText">This was eventually streamlined to the point where we had a sort
      of jury system for moderating releases. We had screw-ups, which I
      handled internally as appealing to personal pride. One time there was a
      glitch in the system that resulted in two fields being swapped, and I
      ended up privately talking to the developer and saying, "Look, you made
      me look like a fool in front of the client. I took that bullet, but
      don't do that kind of thing again." And after that, he was extremely
      conscientious and diligent about making sure that never happened
      again.</p>
<p class="docText">I came from a background that was
      theoretical, very driven by the idea of what engineering design is. We
      were all trained with the idea that we don't have a monopoly on the
      truth. So, we expect arguments to take place. We also placed a cultural
      emphasis on the idea that the arguments weren't personal. I tend to say
      that I expect the most productive environments are composed of people
      who respect each other but are personally neutral to each other, the
      reason being that they will provide unbiased judgments and they won't
      treat each other as fools. They're not interested in being nice to spare
      your feelings, and they're not interested in being nasty to hurt your
      feelings. As a group, you have the courage to argue with each other, and
      the objectivity to actually reach a consensus at the end.</p>
<p class="docText">One of our rules about arguing was that you have to reach some
      kind of consensus finally. Then we could go at each other full out. Most
      of the time the arguments we had were technical or experimental or
      something of that nature, so at the end of the argument we'd have to
      conduct a test to find out who's right. The thing is that most of the
      people we were dealing with were PhD-educated. This is part and parcel
      of the process: if you don't know if something's true or not, you have
      to test.</p>
