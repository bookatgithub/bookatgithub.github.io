<p class="docText">Throughout the 1980s, requirements rose while competition
        intensified in our segment of the engineering field, which can broadly
        be called <a name="idx-CHP-30-0918"></a>scientific data processing. As hardware got faster,
        generic workstations became better at meeting customer requirements
        without need for the clever tricks we used at Edom Engineering to
        achieve maximum performance. Meanwhile, the standard libraries and
        advanced features of Unix operating systems grew to the point where
        even our crack programming staff couldn't reproduce everything
        customers expected.</p>
<p class="docText">Our core scientific and engineering market was also shrinking
        because of an unrelated external factor: the U.S. military in the
        1980s reduced the research funding upon which many of our customers
        depended.</p>
<p class="docText">It was in the late 1980s when Edom Engineering managers decided
        on a leap that they hoped would establish a new beachhead in advanced
        computing. Throughout its existence, we had been happy basing our
        systems on Motorola chips. But the new wave of Reduced Instruction Set
        Computing (<a name="idx-CHP-30-0919"></a>RISC) processors promised much better performance. The
        sages among our hardware engineering staff checked out these
        processors and selected one that they said could deliver the
        performance we needed.</p>
<p class="docText">The impetus behind RISC processors was the increasingly
        multilayered decision-making required within conventional chips from
        Intel and Motorola, which computer scientists now categorized with the
        demeaning term <span class="docEmphasis">Complex Instruction Set Computing</span>
        (CISC). Conventional chips got that name because they contained large
        numbers of instructions, some narrowly tailored to particular software
        tasks. Different instructions sometimes require different numbers of
        cycles, forcing the chip's engineers on the hardware side, as well as
        compiler developers on the software side, to build in more complex
        scheduling. The weight of all these components led to a need for more
        wires connecting the processing unit to memory.</p>
<p class="docText">By the 1980s, computer scientists
        determined that increased overhead from these trends was eating up
        processor power, and concluded that they could create a competitive
        new generation of chips using a stripped-down set of very short,
        simple instructions that behaved in rigorously similar ways in a fixed
        number of cycles. Implementations from various companies hit the
        market in that decade. RISC became the major story in the trade press,
        and benchmarks bore out the inventors' predictions.</p>
<p class="docText">Thus began the Longjump project at Edom Engineering. It was
        fraught with uncertainty from the start. We were basing a system on a
        new product based on a new computing paradigm, and depending on a
        small firm with an unknown track record. At the same time as the
        hardware team wrapped the chip into an audacious new system trying to
        take advantage of every possible feature for speed, the software teams
        had to port our unique, finely tuned operating system, compiler, and
        libraries. Because RISC was so different an architecture from the
        Motorola chips we had always used, we had to base our compiler and a
        lot of our system utilities on those provided by the RISC vendor. The
        porting effort steered through uncharted waters.</p>
<p class="docText">An engineer I'll call George was appointed project leader for
        Longjump. George was a relatively young project leader, an earnest,
        restless fellow with an unusual personality for an engineer in those
        days. He bore a trim mustache, kept his shoulders slightly hunched as
        he sat in meetings, and looked about with tight lips that got tighter
        when he listened to news he didn't want to hear. He had a foot in
        marketing as well as engineering, and tended to wear suit jackets in
        an age when traditional computer nerd attire was even sloppier than it
        is today. He must have known that a more professional look would
        bolster his credibility when meeting with top management. And because
        this was his first attempt as project leader, he felt the need to
        convey credibility.</p>
<p class="docText">At the company meeting where Longjump was presented, George
        stood before the assembled management and staff to make a brief speech
        that included a seemingly formulaic phrase: "I'd like to thank the
        company's managers for entrusting me with the leadership of this
        project."</p>
<p class="docText">I don't think he anticipated how the rest of us would react to
        this gracious statement. We all knew Longjump was a hazardous
        undertaking, and this was no moment for even a hint of timidity. By
        thanking management for their trust, he planted in our minds the seed
        of doubt that he could live up to it.</p>
<p class="docText">But ultimately, if George played any counterproductive role, it
        was by showing too much deference to his managers as they directed the
        project into stagnant channels.</p>
