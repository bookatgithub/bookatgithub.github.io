<p class="docText">There are a lot of charities out there, and no shortage of
        places for you to donate money. But few organizations are as effective
        or innovative as <a name="idx-CHP-14-0356"></a>PlayPumps International. It's hard to imagine a better
        use of money than bringing clean drinking water to people in villages
        in sub-Saharan Africa who desperately need it. And PlayPumps does it
        in a unique way: by driving the pumps with merry-go-rounds or
        roundabouts, which the children in the village play on. Not only does
        this give clean water&mdash;which both nourishes the people and prevents
        water-borne disease&mdash;but it also frees up women, who in many villages
        have to literally spend their entire day fetching water, often from
        polluted sources. Trevor Field, the founder of PlayPumps, inspires us
        not just because he does great work, but because he does it through
        great innovation, engineering, and teamwork, which is why part of the
        proceeds from every copy of Beautiful Teams sold will be donated to
        PlayPumps International. We had the privilege of speaking to Trevor
        about his organization.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So first of all, thank you
      so much for talking to me. Jenny and I are really impressed with
      everything you guys have done. Since this whole book is about
      engineering teams and how to make them work better, it occurred to us
      that you had put together more than just an organization that does
      really good things in the world; really, it amounts to a major civil
      engineering effort. We wanted to talk to you about how you put it all
      together, the history of it, and the challenges you
      faced</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">If you could start by giving us a little bit of a
      background: tell us how you started PlayPumps, and a little bit about
      what the organization's about</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-14-0357"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: Water is the source of
      life on this planet, and it's always been very interesting to me. Some
      years ago my father-in-law came up to visit me with his wife. While my
      wife and my mother-in-law went out shopping, I took my father-in-law to
      an agricultural show in Pretoria, which is about 50 kilometers north of
      Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="docText">At the show, there was a guy called Ronnie Stuiver. He was a
      driller, showing a drilling rig and compressors, that kind of stuff. And
      he had a model of a PlayPump system. It was a different one to the ones
      that we've got now, but I saw the concept&mdash;I saw how this could possibly
      work. The problem he had with it was that it had a lot more steel
      attached to it, and when compared to a hand pump like an Afridev or a
      Mono Pump, the price was just ridiculous. I'd been involved in outdoor
      advertising and advertising in magazines for a long time, and I just
      loved the idea of this thing. I approached him and got him to give me
      the exclusive rights to sell the idea. And it was born from
      there.</p>
<p class="docText">I thought that the easiest way we can make this work is to get the
      private sector involved. And the way to do that was to be able to pump
      the water into an overhead storage tank, and then put advertising
      messages around those tanks. Rural people are not exposed to television
      or the Internet or magazines or newspapers. You go into the very rural
      areas, and there's no advertising whatsoever.</p>
<p class="docText">A water pump is like the focal point of the community. If we could
      put messages up there that advertise the kind of stuff that local, rural
      people bought&mdash;sugar, tea, coffee, and these days, cell phone rechargers,
      and all that kind of stuff&mdash;it should work. That's what we did; that's
      how we started.</p>
<p class="docText">And it's grown hugely from there. We bought the patents from that
      chap, Ronnie Stuiver, and we redesigned and reengineered the whole
      thing. We've got our own factory in a place called Modderfontein, just
      up the road. And we employ 36 people in my factory. The factory's
      capable of producing a hundred units a month with ease. That's how the
      concept basically started.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: When you reengineered the pump, what needed to
      be done? Was there an interesting or difficult design
      challenge?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: It was that the chap
      had made a model. From a model we had to actually design the actual
      working unit, which is what we did. He actually made some units for us
      in the early days. But Ronnie, you know, he was a farmer, with a
      workshop on his farm. He used to build things by hand, and hammer them
      out&mdash;it wasn't polished.</p>
<p class="docText">We were concerned with the equipment. It was
      OK here in South Africa because we could maintain the equipment
      ourselves. But when you're looking to export into other countries, you
      need an export-quality product. So, we bought the patent from him, and
      we reengineered the whole thing&mdash;not from scratch, but basically we had
      every piece tested for stress and tolerances. And we made a new model
      that we were confident that we could go and put into the bush and leave
      it, and it would work.</p>
<p class="docText">So that was the challenge there.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: A lot of people who read this book who build
      software will definitely recognize that&mdash;the idea of starting with a
      prototype, something that they've built themselves, and having to harden
      it in order to get it to the state where it can be shipped out to people
      who will use it in the field every day</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: That's exactly what we
      had to do. I mean, you have to leave this thing in the middle of nowhere
      and just hope that it's going to continue to work. Plus, you've got a
      responsibility to the kids. I've seen 70-odd children on one of these
      roundabouts, all piled on top of each other. The average weight of a
      child that's playing on a roundabout is about 30 kilograms. You've got
      20-odd, 30 children of 30 kilograms each and you're talking tons of
      momentum. You've got to make sure that the thing doesn't break. So we
      had to make sure that all of the bearings and all of the moving parts
      were extremely strong and all had tolerances way in excess of anything
      that the kids could throw at it. I think the main bearings have a
      breaking strength of about four and a half tons; huge compared to what
      it's actually going to receive.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And I'm sure the kids are going to play with
      things in ways that you never even thought of, right?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: Absolutely. That's why
      we use a positive displacement cylinder. Without getting technical, the
      thing goes up and down. As the kids turn round and round, the mechanism
      transfers that motion into reciprocal vertical motion, so the pump goes
      up and down. You do get pumps that go round and round, such as an
      Archimedes screw principle. The problem with that is that they only go
      in one direction and you can't reverse it, because if you reverse it, it
      just undoes all the piping.</p>
<p class="docText">And if you put a brake on it&mdash;well, that's exactly what the kids
      are going to do. They're going to try and brake it, because they want to
      go the other way, you know.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: That has to be enormously motivating for
      everybody who was working on the engineering, and for the guys in the
      factory actually building the pumps. I mean, you don't get a lot of
      products where you're actually doing real, honest-to-God good for the
      world</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-14-0358"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: It's a shame that you
      can't come here and see a real one, because we could take you to the
      factory. We've got guys at our factory who are just pop-riveting steel
      onto frames, and it doesn't look like anything to them. So to motivate
      them, we had posters of the PlayPump blown up. You know, we did have an
      outdoor advertising company, a professional one that used to do huge
      billboards on the side of the road. (We sold it and disposed of all our
      assets to concentrate solely on <a name="idx-CHP-14-0359"></a>PlayPumps.) We printed these massive posters
      of what these <a name="idx-CHP-14-0360"></a>PlayPumps looked like, and we hung them up in the factory
      so the guys who are actually making them get motivated.</p>
<p class="docText">And you know, my partner's a bit of a creative guy, so the pumps
      get painted red, yellow, green&mdash;bright, bright colors, the kind of stuff
      that kids like. So, we painted the whole factory like that. All the
      handrails are red, yellow, green. I mean, it looks like Charlie and the
      Chocolate Factory!</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">The PlayPumps factory.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It's one challenge just to get the pumps to the
      point where you can manufacture them and they can stand up to the
      punishment of being left to do the job. But getting them out into the
      field, that's got to be a challenge, too</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: That's a huge
      challenge. I mean the fuel price alone&mdash;I don't know what a gallon of gas
      costs in California these days, but in New York it's going to cost more
      or less the same. Problem with Africa is it's difficult to transport
      this stuff around, and it's heavy. Very heavy.</p>
<p class="docText">The price of fuel in South Africa is about $1 a liter or
      thereabouts. But the price of fuel in Uganda, for instance, is more like
      $7 per liter. You can't plan anything with those kinds of variables. It
      really does mess up the logistics in a big way.</p>
<p class="docText">And in places like Zimbabwe, they've got no fuel at all. That's
      one of the reasons why we're not there, apart from, well, obviously Mr.
      Mugabe's going to have to disappear before we go there at all. And
      that's a pity, because we want to help the people in Zimbabwe. They're
      suffering, and it's not their fault. They were just born in the wrong
      time zone. And it's our neighbor. I could drive to Harare from here;
      it's like driving to the coast for Christmas holiday. The roads are
      good, but the border guards want a 35% import duty on a gift. Well, not
      in my lifetime, we're not going to do that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds like working with
      other countries and their governments and borders brings its own set of
      challenges</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-14-0361"></a><a name="idx-CHP-14-0362"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: We get import waivers
      from all of the countries that we're working on because we raise funds
      from America, Britain, all over the world, and we make these pumps and
      we actually give them to the recipient communities within that
      country.</p>
<p class="docText">We insist that the government gives us a customs duty exemption.
      So, that's one challenge, getting that import duty exemption. Another is
      getting through the borders, because all the borders have some very
      cavalier ideas on what's supposed to happen with imports and
      exports.</p>
<p class="docText">And then you've got other problems, as well. The road system is
      not really great in other countries. For instance, I think you'd call it
      an 18-wheeler, a big double semitruck; it carries two containers, a
      40-foot and a 20-foot. We would call that an interlink. You can't put an
      interlink on the road, because they won't allow them in Mozambique. And
      they won't allow them in Zimbabwe because they damage the roads so much.
      We could get 25 units in an interlink, but we can only get 11 on a semi,
      which is a fixed-body truck. So consequently, you know, you've got to
      send two, which doubles your costs.</p>
<p class="docText">We've just done a deal with Malawi, so I've got a Malawi MOU,
      Memorandum of Understanding, with the government. They're very happy to
      accept the pumps, and they've given us the customs duty exemption. But
      to get to Malawi from here, we've got to go through either Mozambique or
      Zimbabwe. And that's a challenge: the fuel's a problem, and the costs
      vary from one transporter to the other hugely, with massively different
      prices.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: I was just thinking about the kinds of
      administrative and bureaucracy issues software people face in their
      jobs. The next time I find myself groaning about having to come up with
      a report for Bob from accounting for my project, I'll remind myself that
      at least I don't need to negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding with a
      government. You must get caught up in a lot of red tape&mdash;and language
      barriers, to boot</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: Yeah. Well, with
      respect to the people I deal with, the majority of them speak pretty
      good English, because they are at a ministerial level. But there are
      still idiosyncrasies that they don't understand.</p>
<p class="docText">And you have to spell it all out, physically go there to sit and
      take time, explain the whole process and how it is going to work, where
      we're going to put these <a name="idx-CHP-14-0363"></a>PlayPumps, and when they arrive in a country who's going
      to store them. We want to know if it's secure, because we don't want
      people running off with bits and pieces. Because every part of the
      machine is put together at our factory, and every nut and bolt is
      counted and double-counted and checked into a nylon sack that's got all
      of the little bits and pieces in it. You don't want an installer to be
      300 or 400 kilometers from Dar es Salaam in the bush trying to install
      this thing, and then he finds in his sack that he's missing two
      bolts.</p>
<p class="docText">That makes it a tad of an operational
      problem, you know. We have to send up spare units and spare parts for
      the installers. The model we use is basically the same in every country
      as it is in South Africa.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Installing a PlayPump.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you do most of your work in South Africa? How
      does installation work? Maintenance? It's got to be a
      challenge</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: How it works is that in
      South Africa you've got nine provinces. We work in five main provinces:
      the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Mpumalanga, Limpopo, and Northwest.
      Those are provinces that are historically the most deprived from a
      facilities point of view.</p>
<p class="docText">We've got an installation crew in each province. What happens is
      that we'll send a truck with, say, 25 units on it to KwaZulu-Natal. It
      usually goes to the municipal buildings in that area, where we'll store
      the equipment. Our installer in KwaZulu-Natal will go in every day, load
      up a couple of pumps, go out to the sites, and start the
      installations.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Maintenance has to have its own challenges. Have
      you had to get creative to handle those challenges? How does that all
      work?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: When the installer
      finishes the installations, he becomes the maintenance guy for those
      pumps. On the tank stand itself we used to put a free phone number, our
      0800 number. So, if a pump broke down, a person could write that number
      down on a piece of paper and go to a telephone, go to a local store or a
      spaza shop, get hold of a telephone, make a free call to our offices in
      Joburg, and report the pump out of order.</p>
<p class="docText">But that was an absolute disaster, because what happened was in
      reality a pump would break down, the guy who got to the pump would write
      down the telephone number for the pump repair, go
      to the phone, and phone us up. We'd ask, "Which pump is it?" And he'd
      say, "I don't know, it's the one by the school," you know. And we'd say,
      "Which school?" And he'll say, "Ambabulla School." And we'd look on our
      database and we haven't got an Ambabulla School because they've got
      seven different names for the same place.</p>
<p class="docText">That was a real problem, one we really wrestled to try and
      overcome. Eventually we cracked the idea of using text messages on cell
      phones. Because it didn't matter which rural province you're in, or how
      poor the people are, somebody's always got a cell phone. It's
      amazing.</p>
<p class="docText">So, what we do now is we've got a number on the tank. Well, we've
      always had numbers on the tank to identify them&mdash;in KwaZulu-Natal it
      would be KZN001, for instance. That would be the unique number for that
      particular pump, which is GPS'ed on our database so we know where it is
      within 5 meters, and we see it on Google Earth, too, so that's another,
      you know, advantage.</p>
<p class="docText">What we came up with was that we'd say, "SMS or text this number,
      KZN001, to this phone number." That way, we'd see which pump number it
      is on the message, which means we could identify it straightaway. And
      then we can phone the guy back, because our phone identifies his phone,
      his phone number, so we can communicate with the person who is reporting
      the pump out of order.</p>
<p class="docText">That worked a lot better. And it's a simple thing, but it took a
      bit of working out, I can tell you.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Sometimes simple, elegant solutions to complex
      problems are the hardest ones to come up with. And it worked
      well?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: Yes, it worked really
      well. The only saving grace was that you know when a pump does break
      down, because it is a person's supply of water. You get way more than
      one or two calls, you get lots of them.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: In addition to the organization that gets the
      pumps out into the fields to deliver the water, you're also running a
      charitable organization. I'm sure that had a different set of
      challenges, establishing PlayPumps and getting it all set up. Was this
      something you'd done before?</span><a name="idx-CHP-14-0364"></a><a name="idx-CHP-14-0365"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: No, I'd never done it
      before.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So you had to learn a lot to do
      this</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: What happened was that
      in 1999, about eight, eight and a half years ago, we were running a
      fully commercial operation called Roundabout Outdoor, which we still run
      today. We were selling the advertising on all four sides of those water
      towers for commercial gain. We had a launch in the south of Johannesburg
      at a place called Reitfontein. Former President Nelson Mandela was
      there&mdash;there was huge excitement, thousands of people turn up whenever
      he's around. He came and looked at the pump. That was the first and only
      time that I actually shook his hand. A whole lot of different people
      were there, from the World Bank, from UNICEF and
      CARE and Planet International, all sorts of different people.</p>
<p class="docText">I was talking to a guy from the World Bank, a guy called Dr. Ross
      Paul, who's retired now in Australia. I asked him, "How can we get, you
      know, funds for this system?" And he said to me, "There's a competition
      called the Development Marketplace Competition. Why don't you enter
      that?"</p>
<p class="docText">So we did, in a very, very rushed fashion&mdash;the deadline was
      approaching for submissions. I went to his office and spoke to him about
      what we did, and he typed it in on his computer, and we put the online
      application in to the competition. We got short-listed, and I went and
      presented it in Washington, DC. We won the competition. They gave us&mdash;I
      think it was $165,000 in those days. We used that money to put more
      pumps in the ground. That's how it started.</p>
<p class="docText">But what happened after that was that people had seen the system.
      Instead of us amortizing the advertising against the cost of the
      equipment, people started giving us money out of the blue. One guy from
      Ireland gave us like 10,000 pounds, and somebody else just sent us money
      in the post, another did transfers into our bank account. We were a
      for-profit organization accepting donations. It was getting a bit
      awkward.</p>
<p class="docText">So I spoke to the Ministry of Water at the time, a guy by the name
      of Ronnie Kasrils, and I asked him what he thought we should do. He
      referred this to the Finance Department, and they wrote letters between
      each other. Then I was called into the SARS in South Africa&mdash;you'd know
      that as the IRS. I almost had a heart attack when they gave me the call,
      because I thought it was my personal tax they were looking at. But they
      wanted to talk to me about the structure of the company.</p>
<p class="docText">I went there and basically they said, "What you want? What do you
      want us to do?" And I said, "I want you to work out some sort of
      incentive that would enable or encourage a company to give us more
      money, because when we make a pump we're going to put it in the ground.
      It's not mine, and it's not the company's, it's not Anglo American's [a
      South African mining company that contributes to <a name="idx-CHP-14-0366"></a>PlayPumps]. It belongs to the people. So where's the
      inducement to get Anglo to give us more money?"</p>
<p class="docText">I was anchoring for them to give us a tax incentive. And they did!
      They worked out a structure: they said, "OK, you need to open another
      company and make that an NGO." Then they said that Ministers want to do
      this so much that they'll make it a PBO, a Public Benefit Organization,
      because the work we do is ostensibly what public works should be
      doing.</p>
<p class="docText">We opened up the NGO and we called it Roundabout PlayPumps. We
      kept Roundabout Outdoor, our original company, because we have telephone
      numbers and faxes and computers on all the business cards and
      letterheads. The NGO accepts the donations from various quarters, and
      Roundabout Outdoors was designated the implementation organization for
      that NGO. So, that's how the structure works. But yes, we've had
      challenges like you can't believe.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Wow. It sounds like you've
      really come a long way. That's really inspiring. Do you have any advice
      for someone who wants to do good things, but might be a little
      intimidated by the size of the problem? How did you keep motivated, even
      when you weren't sure how it was going to turn out?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Trevor</span>: Well, look, from a
      motivational point of view, I'd come up with this idea in 1989, and my
      wife actually put the first two pumps in the ground in KwaZulu-Natal in
      1993. I couldn't give up my day job at the time&mdash;it's the same old story,
      you know.</p>
<p class="docText">How anybody gets anywhere is that you just have to adopt the Nike
      slogan: just do it. You just go do it, and that's what I did. One day I
      walked out of the job that I was in, and decided I wanted to do this
      full-time.</p>
<p class="docText">We had two pumps then, and lots of people laughed at me. "Ha, ha,
      ha, a children's merry-go-round that pumps water, yeah, yeah, sure, OK,
      you know. You will be all right, just keep taking the pills,
      whatever."</p>
<p class="docText">Well, they're not laughing now. We had First Lady Laura Bush, Bill
      Clinton, and Steve and Jean Case from the Case Foundation standing on
      the stage at the Clinton Global Incentive, in the States, awarding a $16
      million investment into <a name="idx-CHP-14-0367"></a>PlayPumps globally for a 10-country expansion.</p>
<p class="docText">So, from two pumps that we started with in 1994 to 4,000 pumps
      across Africa affecting 10 million people. Yeah, you've just got to
      stick to your knitting and just make it happen. And that's exactly what
      we've done.</p>
