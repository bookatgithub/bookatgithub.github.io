<h3 id="643999-896" class="docSection1Title">27.10. Schedules</h3>
<p class="docText">We had a meeting the following day, just to start develop the
        <a name="idx-CHP-27-0854"></a>rolling wave schedule. I posted the months on stickies
        across the top of the wall, along with the known major milestones,
        such as internal demo, initial customer demo, <a name="idx-CHP-27-0855"></a>and customer release, under their correct months. I
        listed the features down the side on a piece of flip-chart paper, in
        the order the developers told me they were going to implement
        them.<a name="idx-CHP-27-0856"></a></p>
<p class="docText">I asked, "What will it take us to get to these first two
        features?"</p>
<p class="docText">Dan replied, "No, JR, we're working in parallel. That's the
        wrong question. The real question is who will do what when?"</p>
<p class="docText">"OK, as long as we don't plan the whole darn project at once.
        The idea of doing this on stickies is to make sure we can figure out a
        Plan B if this plan doesn't work. Remember, when you write your
        <a name="idx-CHP-27-0857"></a>tasks on stickies, make the tasks as small as
        possible."</p>
<p class="docText">Everyone wrote his tasks on stickies. Most of the tasks were one
        or two weeks long.</p>
<p class="docText">"OK, guys, I'm in trouble now."</p>
<p class="docText">"Why?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Because I am not going to know for too long if anyone is in
        trouble. Neither will you. You have to make smaller tasks. I bet each
        of you does something every day, right?"</p>
<p class="docText">Heads nodded.</p>
<p class="docText">"OK, then write all those things down, just for this first week.
        If you know enough about the second week, add that, too."</p>
<p class="docText">After they'd revised their first two weeks of stickies, I
        explained, "OK, I'm not going to ask you every day what you're doing.
        You're going to tell me if you don't make the progress you think
        you're going to make. If you know why, tell me that, too. Some tasks
        you'll finish on time, some might be early, and some might be late. My
        job is to figure out if you're late on a task how that matters to the
        rest of the team and the project. If it's a systemic problem, we'll
        address it in a group meeting. If not, the two of us will discuss
        it.</p>
<p class="docText">"I won't bug you for status. You'll email me status on Friday
        mornings, and we'll have one-on-ones on Tuesdays. That way I know if I
        need to do something a couple of times every week. OK?"</p>
<p class="docText">Sam frowned, looking concerned. "Johanna, this seems like a lot
        of work for us. At least for me. Do I really have to break down all my
        tasks into small pieces for the rest of the project?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I don't know how to effectively manage
        this project given the tight schedule <a name="idx-CHP-27-0858"></a>and technical risks. Do you have a better idea?"</p>
<p class="docText">"No."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, try it for two weeks and we'll see how intrusive it is.
        If it takes too much time or you think it's a waste of time, we'll
        address it at a weekly team meeting. But this has worked for me
        before. You need to plan only the next two to three weeks in detail.
        Not any more than that."</p>
