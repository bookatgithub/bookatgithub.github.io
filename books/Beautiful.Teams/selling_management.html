<p class="docText">After a few more discussions about XP, Alan and Johnny were
        warming up to the idea. We briefed our manager, Fred, on XP and he was
        all for trying it, but we needed to go to the boss, Bud, our director.
        We knew there would be some contentious issues, specifically around
        keeping the process police at bay and providing the level of
        documentation that was needed. The documentation requirements at BBS
        were heavy. But it was my job as the team's mentor to challenge their
        current practices and help them grow.</p>
<p class="docText">I prepared a presentation on the practices of XP. We anticipated
        some of the issues that would come up and built a case for our
        recommendations. The presentation ended with a few open-ended
        questions to get a dialog going.</p>
<p class="docText">Bud: "This all sounds very good, but how will we handle the
        <a name="idx-CHP-15-0373"></a>technical <a name="idx-CHP-15-0374"></a>reviews required by our process?"</p>
<p class="docText">"We need to take the reviews off the critical path," I told Bud.
        I told him something he already knew: that the reviews temporarily
        block progress. Preparing for reviews was time-consuming and we also
        had the logistical problem of scheduling the senior engineers for our
        review meeting. We discussed how the current approach reviewed untried
        design ideas.</p>
<p class="docText">I explained, "Your most experienced people spend all their time
        in reviews rather than building the product. You need an experienced
        designer on each team." We talked about how design is a daily
        activity, not an event that ends when the sign-off happens.</p>
<p class="docText">Bud: "I think I understand. Are you saying we don't need
        reviews?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I'm not comfortable giving up reviews, but we will change what
        is reviewed and when," I responded. We knew that periodic reviews
        could not be avoided completely, but that we could find a more
        effective way to do them. The reviews stop the team's forward progress
        until the review meeting is held and the design is signed off. We told
        Bud that by moving the reviews off the critical path we could keep the
        team moving ahead doing continuous design, implementation, and
        testing.</p>
<p class="docText">"Currently, you use the most experienced people for reviewing
        the designs rather than creating the designs," I told him. We
        discussed how by having just one experienced designer on the team we
        could, with daily design discussions and pair programming, keep the
        design quality high.</p>
<p class="docText">Bud asked: "OK, but what will be reviewed?"</p>

<p class="docText">"We will review what was built and tested rather than what we
        anticipated building," I told Bud. We discussed that during each
        iteration, we would capture the important architectural decisions and
        constructs. If design problems were discovered during the reviews, we
        could make changes with confidence. Our automated tests would lock in
        the behavior. Any changes required by the reviews could be fixed in
        the next iteration.</p>
<p class="docText">"Let's be clear on the purpose of the design document. Its
        purpose is to provide a high-level road map of the system," I added,
        "The details will be where they belong in the code and its
        tests."</p>
<p class="docText">Bud: "Wait a second, there is no detailed design
        documentation?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Not at all," I responded. "Using test-first programming we are
        going to have many automated unit tests. The test cases are the
        detailed documentation." We discussed how each test case is a focused
        code example with a specific precondition and desired outcome.</p>
<p class="docText">I added: "The tests are an executable specification." Once
        people learn to read the tests, the tests become a very effective form
        of detailed documentation. It's not like prose documents that you have
        to read and interpret. This spec can be executed and we can see if
        <a name="idx-CHP-15-0396"></a>there are any deviations, now and in the future. "It's
        the gift that keeps on giving," I added.</p>
<p class="docText">Being a little uncertain, I added, "Bud, as you know, we are new
        to this, but we think it makes sense. And anyway, with the one-month
        cycles, we can try this approach and revisit our decision each
        month."</p>
<p class="docText">Bud: "OK, we'll make continuous improvements." But then he
        added: "How do we know the tests are right?"</p>
<p class="docText">"We've been thinking about that one." I paused, and then
        continued: "We plan on <a name="idx-CHP-15-0397"></a>pair programming helping us, but we think we should
        review the test cases. We want to make sure the module is doing the
        right thing and has a usable and well-engineered interface."</p>
<p class="docText">Bud: "OK, we review the tests to check that the interface is
        right, and also make sure the tests are testing the right
        stuff."</p>
<p class="docText">"Yes, that's the idea." We went on to further discuss and
        convince ourselves we were making a good decision. The key points we
        settled on are that the specific implementation details may not be as
        critical as having a good interface and the right behavior. Those
        things impact the larger architecture. I added: "Don't forget that if
        some implementation needs improvement, we have the tests backing us up
        to make sure that during refactoring the external behavior is
        preserved."</p>
<p class="docText">Bud: "OK, but our process requires <a name="idx-CHP-15-0398"></a>code reviews, and they have helped us quite a bit. When
        do those happen? Does pair programming take their place?"</p>
<p class="docText">"We think so. That's one of these <span class="docEmphasis">Extreme</span>
        things that we are a little concerned about," I added. "Code reviews
        happen continuously with pair programming." I took a little time to
        describe how pair programming works. We take turns working with each
        other, maybe a few hours at a time. It's like a live code review, but
        could actually be better in some ways, and maybe worse in other ways.
        Two people are involved in making design decisions and naming the
        classes, functions, and variables in the code. The downside is if the
        pair gets shortsighted together.<a name="idx-CHP-15-0399"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Bud knew they were investing a lot in code reviews. There was
        plenty of preparation and meeting time. We discussed that pair
        programming can eliminate much of that overhead. He liked what he was
        hearing. We all thought that combining pair programming with reviewing
        test cases would result in better quality than today's document-driven
        process.</p>
<p class="docText">Bud: "We get the code review in real time to make sure our
        format standards are met. The test cases show what the code is
        supposed to do and confirm that it does it."</p>
<p class="docText">Bud was great. He knew the current process was slowing the teams
        down and believed that the common-sense XP practices could help
        accelerate our progress. He knew change was needed. He was excited
        about the potential for improved schedule predictability, improved
        quality, and improved fun at work. He said if he got just one of those
        and the other two did not decline, he would consider this XP project a
        success. Bud gave us the green light to "go
        <a name="idx-CHP-15-0400"></a>Extreme." We also got a "get out <a name="idx-CHP-15-0401"></a>of jail free" card with the process police. "I'll sign
        any process waivers you need," Bud said.</p>
<p class="docText">In hindsight, Bud made me see one thing that enables a great
        team to form: a manager with vision, bravery, and a willingness to
        support his team. Bud supported us, believed in us, and made it safe
        for us to go outside the established norms.</p>
