        Being Mr. Goodbar, the Time Has Come to Act and Act Quickly"</h3>
<p class="docText">After we had staked out our respective cubes and started to
        settle in, Hedley arrived to take stock of his minions in their new
        habitat. Hedley being Hedley, he immediately noticed that a few of us
        had moved our monitors from the middle of the desk to a position a
        little off to one corner or the other. This unauthorized cubicle
        customization was quickly proscribed. That should have been a clear
        signal to recirculate my resume. Someone unable to properly consider
        the costs of this affront to his aesthetic sense in comparison to the
        comfort of the developers, and more importantly, the message his
        decree would send to the team, should not be trusted with the helm. I
        mostly saw it as a slap in the face. Hedley could not have more
        clearly communicated his evaluation of the team. We were clearly not
        highly educated, highly skilled professionals who were an asset to the
        company. C$ picked up on the sudden onset of tension in the office, or
        maybe he saw my posture change to something a bit more hostile. He
        quickly shooed Hedley out of the office and immediately tried to
        downplay the situation. It worked. I was now focused on the immediate
        problem, which for me had an easy solution: "Fuck him." I was going to
        put my monitor where I wanted the damn thing. But I should have
        remained focused on the fact that Hedley clearly had issues. I missed
        a clear signal to jump ship. It became a moot point when we came to
        realize that Hedley was unlikely to ever step foot in the office
        again.</p>
<p class="docText">The promise of alternative work schedules took a long time to be
        realized, too. When we did get movement, we were immediately
        disappointed.</p>
<p class="docText">Notes from our first meeting at the
        SDC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">Alternative Work Schedule&mdash;We're still working out the details
          of the Alternative Work Schedule. To clarify, the envisioned
          Alternative Work Schedule is not a flex schedule. Employees will be
          offered a variety of start/end times from which he/she may
          choose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">He was implicitly trusting us with the fate of his company, but
        he was unwilling to explicitly trust us to come to work without
        punching a clock. Another sad message: I need a clock to evaluate your
        performance because I can't/won't be concerned with what you actually
        do. Hedley was also showing us his knack for highlighting the cloud
        instead of the silver lining. We'd see this several years later, when
        a company bonus scheme was rolled out. The company was seriously tight
        on money; benefits and any non-critical employees were cut again. It
        was correctly feared that people were soon going to bail, and we
        couldn't afford to lose a single person with so little staff
        remaining. A bonus was announced for those willing to ride it out. The
        details were typically fuzzy, but if the company made money, and we
        stuck it out, we'd get a cut. I wasn't counting on seeing a dime of
        it, but we appreciated the gesture. Sadly, I don't remember the bonus
        ever being promoted as an incentive again. When we did manage to hold
        the lines, and the company actually survived to make some profit,
        Hedley did not seem to be happy. There was enough delay and so little
        mention of when we'd actually get the checks that most assumed we had
        been screwed (it's what we were expecting anyway). We were all pretty
        shocked, at a company meeting, when the checks were actually handed
        out. Through his words and body language, he managed to make an
        unexpected payday disappointing. That layoff cycle was just one among
        many. However, there was one round of layoffs that forever changed the
        SDC and probably was an event that unleashed the full potential of the
        core development team.</p>
<p class="docText">"Some of these envelopes contain stock options; the others
        contain letters of reference. I ask that you wait to open them until
        after I leave." Hedley may have said more, probably about our always
        favorable sales pipeline, but that was all anyone heard. The entire
        company (about 35 of us) had been called to the SDC for this meeting
        with no explanation. We had been organized into a large circle in the
        center of the office before the envelopes had been handed out. He was
        walking out the door, while the employees were left clutching
        identical manila envelopes and staring at each other in stunned
        silence. Eyes darted back and forth looking for answers, or for a
        signal to start opening the envelopes. Some seemed to be trying to
        determine their envelope's contents without opening it, like a child
        at Christmas shaking his gift-wrapped package. My envelope was of
        little interest to me; instead, I had remote, but potentially more
        pressing, concerns. Namely, who was the most likely to snap and shoot
        us all, or, more worryingly, who might shoot me? I had recently been
        promoted to software development manager; all it really meant was that
        I had the excuse to get more pay and to lay claim to one of the two
        tall cubes. And, after that day, to call dibs on the only parking spot
        attached to the office. The org chart described an alternate reality.
        The entire dev team were listed as my direct reports, while I reported
        to C$, the VP of engineering. There was never any doubt in my mind or
        in the team's mind that anything would change in practice. C$ was
        still the alpha and omega of the Candygram System,
        and by having everyone reporting to him, it would stay that way. So,
        although I had no real managerial responsibilities or control, I did
        get a sneak preview of who made the cut. The meeting was downtown the
        day before. The fact that I had been wearing a tie signaled I was
        there. I wonder if anyone thought I had some input in the
        layoffs.</p>
<p class="docText">Envelopes were opened, and soon the silence was broken with
        sounds of crying. With surprisingly little encouragement or
        organization necessary, we filed across the street to another favorite
        watering hole. We spent the entire afternoon commiserating, with some
        being a bit smoother than others. Empathy has never been my strong
        suit, so I stuck with the developers who had come out unscathed. The
        Cold Lamper, a.k.a. the Blind Guardian, was a more recent addition to
        the SQL team. He was a big, strappin', lantern-jawed lad from coal
        country. From his warm and thoughtful personality, he probably had
        some Boy Scout or altar boy in him in the past. Seeing her alone and
        clearly upset, he bravely went to console our office/QA manager. She
        wasn't very talkative. So he proceeded to tell her how sad it was that
        she lost her whole team, wondered aloud what they would do next, about
        how they would have a hard time finding work, and how it was a shame
        what the changes meant to her role. She cried just a little bit more
        with each thing he said. Finally, she stopped him, telling him she had
        been fired, too.</p>
<p class="docText">After what became known as Black Tuesday, the office environment
        changed dramatically. The remaining employees were almost exclusively
        male, with an average age of around 29. The oldest employee at the SDC
        was a ripe, old 34. With no "adults" present, the office quickly
        devolved. Within a week, it was one part <span class="docEmphasis">Animal
        House</span> and one part <span class="docEmphasis">Lord of the Flies</span>,
        an office situation in which virtually anything was allowable. Every
        statement uttered was a potential starting point for a filthy riposte.
        To this day, I avoid certain words/phrases that were sure to be
        pounced on. (Recently, even in the presence of civilized company, I
        was at a loss as to how I could convey that the ground animal product
        packed in casing was too rich in sodium chloride for my palate.) The
        depravity was not confined to water cooler talk. During design
        reviews, comments were made that would make even Redd Foxx blush.
        Surprisingly, though, if one could ignore the filth, it was the most
        civil and egalitarian office environment I've ever had the pleasure to
        work in. Office politics, at least within our group, ceased to exist
        (other than some griping over good snacks being hoarded during the
        brief period that a selection of snacks was provided by the company).
        I suppose anyone who did not share the mutual respect of the group
        would have long since quit. But in spite of the enormous workload, it
        still was a remarkably easy office to drag myself into every
        day.</p>
<p class="docText">During this time period, the <a name="idx-CHP-28-0884"></a>Hand Circle Game (<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=The+Circle+Game"></a>),
        which we played for pride and shame, not punches, became a daily
        ritual. Within days, simple attempts to catch someone with the circle
        were rendered useless. Cold War mentality set in with attacks and
        counterattacks becoming more intense and creative as the weeks passed.
        Two months later, virtually every surface capable of concealing a
        photo had been booby-trapped with a picture of a team member making a
        legal hand circle. This list included the refrigerator, kitchen
        cabinets, bathroom vanity, toilet paper roll, file cabinets, and even
        CD-ROM drive trays. One intrepid team member (the Cold
        Lamper) managed to get on the Jumbotron between innings at PNC Park,
        shaming more than 20,000 people with quick thinking and a cunning
        display of the circle. (I know what you're thinking: "There's no way
        20,000 people were attending a Pirates game." But this was the year
        the park opened, and a lot of people were there just to see the
        facility. Plus, at that point, the Pirates' streak of consecutive
        losing campaigns stood at a mere eight seasons, so most fans hadn't
        yet given up hope completely.)</p>
<p class="docText">Now, you might understand why working there was almost fun, but
        you also might be wondering when we got anything done. We had almost
        zero turnover in the team. Between the filth, communication was clear,
        rapid, and effective. Management in the traditional sense was
        completely unnecessary. We did what we had to do, making considerable
        progress on the Candygram System. We ignored the company's fiscal
        uncertainty. And we somehow also made time to produce a number of
        custom systems to keep the trickle of cash flowing. The camaraderie
        and rituals that developed during this "Lord of the Flies" period kept
        us going, even following the shuttering of our communal second floor
        space in a vibrant, walkable neighborhood and the subsequent move to a
        sterile, isolated, sprawling space with private offices on the 52nd
        floor of a high-rise on the edge of Pittsburgh's downtown ("dahn-tahn"
        in Pittsburghese).</p>
<p class="docText">The circle game survived the move to the 52nd floor, although
        occasionally the intersection of the game and employees unfamiliar
        with its ways led to some awkward moments. One evening, a group of
        "regular" employees were leaving the office while several developers
        were trying to finish a design meeting before the Cold Lamper had to
        go for the day. The Lamper walked toward the elevator while continuing
        the design conversation. He recognized that the other employees and
        the just-arrived elevator presented a previously unused, and therefore
        unexpected, chance to drop the circle. As the other employees had
        boarded the elevator, he reached around the Colonel (as our accountant
        was known), flashing the circle. Unfortunately, the Colonel, being
        unfamiliar with the game, was also unprepared to have a large man, now
        standing closely behind him, reaching around with his hand making the
        circle in the approximate location of his groin. The Colonel's face,
        as he was clearly unsure of what this particular elevator ride was
        about to have in store, showed a mixture of shock, apprehension, and
        disgust; his expression is forever etched in the mind of more than one
        <a name="idx-CHP-28-0885"></a>Rock Ridge developer.</p>
<p class="docText">A subsequent and final move to a suburban office park (chosen
        for its proximity to Hedley's house and its lower taxes) did not kill
        the game, or the shared insanity powering it. Lesser combatants
        eventually admitted defeat and left the battlefield, leaving two
        developers locked in battle until an epic one-on-one best-of-seven
        series broke the deadlock employing a clever gambit involving barbecue
        potato chips.</p>
<p class="docText">Although the game survived the moves, the close communication
        that knit the group together did not. With increasing financial woes,
        engineers were sent to work at customer sites in an attempt to salvage
        projects that had gone off-track and to log important billable hours.
        The physical separation disrupted the careful balance. Punch lines and
        joke setups that had been passed around Harlem Globetrotter style now
        were falling flat. Without the fun, it was just a job&mdash;and not even a
        good one.</p>
