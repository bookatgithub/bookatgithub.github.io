<h3 id="643999-848" class="docSection1Title">27.4. Starting Off Right</h3>
<p class="docText">This team had more going for it than many other teams. They knew
        how to work together as developers. They were talented people who all
        wanted to do a good job. And they were open to working in whatever way
        the project required them to work to do a good job and meet Big
        Cheese's commitments.</p>
<p class="docText">The team had a "gentlemanly" culture. They didn't swear when
        things went badly. They did let off steam with pranks. It was
        acceptable to call each other "brain-dead" when someone made a dumb
        mistake. But it wasn't acceptable to use profanity or be late for
        meetings.</p>
<p class="docText">Technically, they had other assets. Their automated regression
        test suite had worked for the most recent release. They had an
        automated build system. And they were familiar with code review, unit
        tests, and continuous integration.</p>
<p class="docText">Before the team started on the performance work or the new
        features, they decided to fix the regression test suite, so they would
        know that the current builds worked without having to do manual
        testing.</p>
<p class="docText">The developers <a name="idx-CHP-27-0834"></a>and the previous testers convened a regression test
        meeting.</p>
<p class="docText">Jack, a tester, started explaining how the regression tests
        worked. "OK, everyone look at page 3, that's where the central loop
        for the tests is."</p>
<p class="docText">Sam interrupted, "No, that's not the central loop. Look at page
        6&mdash;that's the central loop."</p>
<p class="docText">Jill, the other tester, piped up, "No, you just don't understand
        how it works. Look at the main part on page 2. See the
        sequencing?"</p>
<p class="docText">Sam glared at Jill, "Do you think I'm brain-dead? Any fool can
        see that the loop is on page 6."</p>
<p class="docText">Jill looked at page 6, and said, "Oh, now I know why you think
        that. Look at this call over here and look at that loop over here."
        She pointed to the different pages, explaining where she was each
        time.</p>
<p class="docText">"Oh, that makes a little more sense. But why didn't you write
        anything about that in the comments?" asked Sam.</p>
<p class="docText">"Because I ran out of time, and thought I would be working with
        you on the next project. It never occurred to me that the company
        wouldn't put testers on this project," replied Jill.</p>
<p class="docText">Everyone turned to look at me. "Hey, I'm sorry, but I can't put
        people on this project who don't exist. Jack and Jill, you know your
        project has more revenue at stake." They nodded. "Well, this team will
        figure out what to do to make this work, even though it's not the best
        situation."</p>
<p class="docText">The testers walked through how the regression tests worked,
        covering the tricky part that had stumped Sam. The team discussed how
        they wanted the regression tests to work, and divided them into
        several chunks, assigning different team members to the chunks. Sam
        took the tricky part "to get more experience with this test framework"
        and the testers agreed that he could ask them questions if any
        arose.</p>
<p class="docText">Within a few days, the developers had the full regression test
        working. In addition, they had chunked it into pieces so that they
        could use pieces of it to take performance measurements and verify
        that the new features wouldn't break anything else. Now it was time to
        start on the new work.</p>
<p class="docText">Everything seemed to go swimmingly until it was time for the
        first feature to be integrated. Every piece of the regression test
        suite blew up.</p>
