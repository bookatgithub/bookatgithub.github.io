<p class="docText">Requirements are all about describing what we're going to have
        when we're done. But as I'm working with the flip charts from one
        workshop, I have a revelation. The use case thought process appears to
        flow naturally into identifying tests we can use to tell whether we
        have in fact built what we intended to build. I had never heard about
        this connection between use cases and tests before, but it certainly
        makes sense to me.</p>
<p class="docText">So, I begin writing tests from the use case description,
        thinking about not how I might implement the use case, but rather how
        I might tell whether I had implemented it correctly. These are
        conceptual tests, free from implementation and user interface
        specifics.</p>
<p class="docText">In the process of writing these tests, I
        discover some errors in my use case. It's another "aha!" moment.
        Perhaps I can use these conceptual tests, developed early in the
        <a name="idx-CHP-19-0606"></a>requirements process, <a name="idx-CHP-19-0607"></a>to find errors long before any design or construction
        takes place!</p>
<p class="docText">I build on this theme. As I mentioned earlier, I had been
        deriving functional requirements from the use case description. In
        principle, if a developer implements that functionality, the user can
        perform the use case. Now I'm deriving tests from that same use case,
        <a name="idx-CHP-19-0608"></a>using a different thought process. I compare those tests
        to my functional requirements, looking for two things:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Is each of my functional requirements covered by a
            test?</p></li><li><p class="docList">Could each of my tests be "executed" by firing off a
            particular series of functional requirements?</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">As I go through this analysis, I find missing, incorrect, and
        unnecessary requirements. Some of these indicate problems <a name="idx-CHP-19-0609"></a>with the use case and some with my decomposition of the
        use case into functionality fragments. I also find missing, incorrect,
        and unnecessary tests. After I fix all of these problems, I have a lot
        more confidence that my requirements are correct.</p>
<p class="docText">I also realize it would be even better if different people,
        using entirely separate brains, were to derive the functional
        requirements and the tests from each use case. Disconnects between
        their results could indicate ambiguities and omissions in the use case
        that lead to different interpretations. I now know that I can begin
        testing a software application immediately after I've written its
        first requirement. This surely beats testing at the end and then
        spending a lot of time and money to fix the errors that originated in
        requirements.</p>
<p class="docText">I invite my product champion, Sarah, to review the tests I wrote
        for the chemists' use cases. She offers additional corrections and
        improvements. In a final workshop, all six chemist representatives
        walk through the tests to make sure we all share a common mental image
        of how the CTS would work. We all have different ideas of what the
        screens might look like, and we'll work through that when we get
        further into design. For now, though, we feel confident that we share
        the same expectations and understanding of what the CTS will do for
        the chemists.</p>
