<p class="docText">You might wonder how Honeywell Air Transport Systems ever got
        involved with making the HADS tool set, since its purpose is to
        produce avionics for commercial aircraft.<a name="idx-CHP-23-0727"></a></p>
<p class="docText">The origin goes back to the 1980s. Sperry Flight Systems was
        making the transition from building analog flight controls to using
        digital computers and software for the controls. At one point in the
        process, Sperry designed its own computer chip and had a software team
        make a hybrid version of Pascal for this processor. They recognized
        that the type checking provided by Pascal provided some safety
        advantages and added some features that were important to writing
        software for flight systems. When the <a name="idx-CHP-23-0728"></a>Ada language became a standard, they became interested
        in the language for developing software for safety-critical flight
        systems.</p>
<p class="docText">In 1985, Sperry Flight Systems began looking at Ada for a
        fly-by-wire system for the proposed Boeing 7J7. The target processor
        was to be a member of the Intel 80 x 86 family with an Ada development
        system from a compiler vendor named <a name="idx-CHP-23-0729"></a>DDC-I. DDC-I was respected as a compiler vendor,
        especially for the quality of its tools and runtimes for the Intel 80
        x 86 family of processors. It also helped that DDC-I had a sales and
        engineering office in Phoenix, Arizona, where Sperry Flight Systems
        was located.</p>
<p class="docText">As part of the software development process for flight-critical
        software, all routines included in the system must be well documented
        and have tests written to ensure code coverage. An effort was
        undertaken to document and test the DDC-I Ada runtime system to the
        level required for DO-178B, the FAA guideline for software. In the
        middle of this process, Sperry Flight Systems was sold to Honeywell.
        The part that dealt with large aircraft such as commercial jetliners
        was named Honeywell Air Transport Systems Division.</p>
<p class="docText">Meanwhile, my wife and I were working as assistant professors at
        Indiana-Purdue University in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In the summers we
        did software consulting at a Magnavox facility in Fort Wayne. Magnavox
        was an early adopter of Ada, working on the first really large Ada
        project, called AFATDS (Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data
        System). In 1988, we decided that my wife would continue her education
        by working on a Ph.D. in computer science and I would support the
        family by finding a job in industry.</p>
<p class="docText">My Ada experience matched Honeywell's needs, and I was hired to
        be a member of a small team that was to reverse-engineer, document,
        and write coverage tests for the DDC-I Ada runtime system that was to
        be used for the 7J7 project. For speed, the runtime was written
        in assembly language, so the first part of documenting the runtime was
        to reverse-engineer the code and write a higher-level pseudocode
        description of each of the algorithms. The purpose of each subprogram
        and when it would be called was also documented. This <a name="idx-CHP-23-0730"></a>team got to the point of having the runtime documented
        when the 7J7 project was cancelled by Boeing.</p>
<p class="docText">Honeywell Air Transport Systems had a continued interest in Ada,
        and knew that it would have future Ada projects, so I began working on
        developing design and coding standards for Honeywell's use of Ada. I
        also developed an in-house training class for Ada. Both of these were
        important because few software developers at Honeywell had any Ada
        experience or experience using many of the software engineering
        principles that Ada was designed to support. In short, I was the
        in-house Ada guru.</p>
<p class="docText">It wasn't very long until Boeing began to develop its next
        airliner, the Boeing 777. Honeywell Air Transport Systems was awarded
        large portions of the software.</p>
<p class="docText">Among the software to be developed was a system called
        <a name="idx-CHP-23-0731"></a>AIMS (Aircraft Information Management System). This
        system was to be written completely in Ada. Previous flight software
        would have one CPU per line replaceable unit (LRU). AIMS integrated
        the functionality that had been distributed into multiple LRUs into a
        single system. A single processor would run several applications. For
        software that was flight-critical, underlying software needed to
        guarantee that one application could not steal time from or corrupt
        the data of another process. Because multiple time-critical
        applications that shared information were to run on a single
        processor, AIMS required a powerful processor.</p>
<p class="docText">Weight on an aircraft is always important. Every pound that is
        flown requires fuel. As part of the weight savings, AIMS was to be
        passively cooled&mdash;no fan was to be used to provide for cooling.</p>
<p class="docText">The hardware engineers at Honeywell did an extensive study of
        the available processors and rejected the most popular Motorola and
        Intel chips as either consuming too much power (therefore being too
        hot to passively cool), or not having enough processing power to
        handle the job. The analysis and the fact that the hardware engineers
        were able to build some early prototypes led the engineers to require
        the AMD 29050 processor for AIMS for the 777. The host system for
        development was DEC VAX computers running VMS, and later, DEC VAX
        workstations.</p>
<p class="docText">This presented an interesting problem, because Honeywell had
        promised Boeing that it would do the AIMS software in Ada, but there
        were no Ada compilers available for the AMD 29050. In my role as Ada
        guru, I recommended that the choice of the 29050 should be revisited.
        Since the quality of the compiler and support tools would have a great
        impact on the development, I felt that the choice of a mature
        compilation system was vital. The hardware engineers insisted that
        only the AMD 29050 would meet their needs, so Honeywell needed to find
        a development system. They approached a number of Ada compiler vendors
        about producing a compiler and related tools, but for various reasons,
        none of these worked out. So, Honeywell decided to make its own
        compiler and development tools. After all, it had
        made compilers before. It did realize that an Ada compiler and tools
        was a more complicated task than creating a Pascal compiler, so it
        formed a partnership with DDC-I. It would use the DDC-I frontend
        technology as the starting point. In addition, two DDC-I employees
        would work as consultants on the project. Several engineers from
        Honeywell's Software Tools section were also to work on the project. I
        was not one of the original members of the team. I was to continue my
        guru role. The product to be delivered was called HADS, the Honeywell
        Ada Development System.</p>
<p class="docText">DDC-I had just completed a project of making an Ada development
        system for the <a name="idx-CHP-23-0732"></a>Intel I960 processor. Since it and the <a name="idx-CHP-23-0733"></a>AMD 29050 both are RISC-like processors, the source code
        for that project was selected as the starting point for the project.
        An Ada compilation system involves much more than just a compiler that
        generates source code. It also requires a runtime system to manage
        tasking, <a name="idx-CHP-23-0734"></a>exception handling, and storage management. Ada's
        tasking is a way, within the language, to allow for communication and
        synchronization of independent threads of control. Exception handling,
        while now common in languages like C++ and Java, was not a well-known
        concept at the time. Ada's storage management allows for the
        management of a general heap as well as other specialized
        heaps.</p>
<p class="docText">The compiler and linker are host tools, and DDC-I had used its
        DEC VAX native Ada compilation system as the tools for developing its
        Ada I960 compiler, so this was a natural choice for writing the HADS
        compiler and linker.</p>
<p class="docText">The runtime portion of the compilation system is code that runs
        on the target. Since the HADS compiler was not yet available for
        generating the needed code, the runtime was written in C and AM29050
        assembler. The portions of the runtime that would be included in the
        safety-critical portions of final AIMS applications would need to be
        documented and tested to DO-178B standards.</p>
<p class="docText">Since I wasn't originally on the team, my recollections of the
        <a name="idx-CHP-23-0735"></a>initial team are based on things I could overhear while
        I was sitting in my nearby cubicle, as well as things told to me
        later. Some developers' names I will be using are not the correct
        names. Some of this is because I truly don't recall the name of a
        person, and some to avoid any possible embarrassment.</p>
