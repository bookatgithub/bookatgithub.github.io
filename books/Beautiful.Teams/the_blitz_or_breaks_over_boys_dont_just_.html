        a Suntan&#8230;"</h3>
<p class="docText">Earlier in 2000, we signed our biggest deal with Succubus Corp.,
        a major gas utility. Phase I would be implementing existing
        functionality. VPC had helped as a reference, but I'm guessing it was
        the wildly optimistic promises, timelines, and budget-friendly price
        of Phase II that sealed the deal. The thinking was that we might not
        make any money, but they'd cover the development costs. Then we'd
        starting making the big bucks, or at least that was the thinking.
        Weeks earlier, we had an event to celebrate the "merging and
        e-merging" of our company. We would be joining forces with a virtual
        company that controlled our IP and was bankrolled by a real estate
        company. Hedley would leverage the parent company's credit to swing a
        sublet of Alcoa's former headquarters on the 52nd floor of the
        second-tallest building downtown. The mayor, who was on hand to say a
        few words, seemed to be a bit suspicious of our projected revenues of
        $250 million in just a few years, and paused a moment for a sideways
        glance as he spoke the numbers. A number of recently bestselling books
        will attest to the many pitfalls of scaling up even the most
        successful small companies. But reality was never a significant input
        to planning decisions, so why should we let it start interfering
        now?</p>
<p class="docText">The Candygram System's current incarnation was able to handle
        basic customer functions and retail product and services billing. In
        Phase II, we had agreed to develop a much more sophisticated billing
        and customer care functionality. We needed to be able to support a
        wide range of features needed by regulated gas utilities, deregulated
        retail and commercial energy companies, and gas transportation and
        pipeline businesses. We were still implementing Phase I, concurrently
        with the new development. But that wasn't all; we had a few demos for
        other larger clients that needed some new features, too. This was in
        addition to our regular load of existing customer support and custom
        system development.</p>
<p class="docText">Recognizing that we were unlikely to start working smarter,
        doubling or trebling our productivity overnight, a bold plan was
        hatched: we would work harder, much harder.</p>

<p class="docText">Rock Ridge NOVEMBER BLITZ</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-28-0886"></a>Rock Ridge Corporation has four major initiatives
          during the month of November: "Squeal Like a Pig" Demonstration;
          Much-Too-Large-For-Us Gas &amp; Light Presentation; Succubus Phase I
          (Products &amp; Services) Enhancements; Succubus Phase III
          (Transportation &amp; Work Order) delivery. These initiatives
          overlap with continuing Succubus Phase II (Gas Utility) testing and
          coding, training, implementation, and developing technical
          documentation, online help, and courseware as well as supporting
          VPCR. Achieving these goals will prove to clients, investors, and
          ourselves that we are a small company with large abilities.</p>
<p class="docText">To achieve these goals I realize that we
          will need to work extended hours. In an effort to make November more
          productive (and not go insane or require a divorce) <a name="idx-CHP-28-0887"></a>Rock Ridge will sponsor the following
          activities:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Compensatory Time</p></li><li><p class="docList">Weekday Dinners</p></li><li><p class="docList">Weekend Lunches</p></li><li><p class="docList">Mid-Month Dinner Outing</p></li><li><p class="docList">End-of-Month Event</p></li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">The effort rested squarely on the development team as we
        represented the long poles in this project plan. Training,
        documentation, and implementation would be, at best, playing catch-up.
        We had no real specs from which they could coordinate their efforts.
        We were making it up as we went along. Soon they were struggling just
        to stay abreast of new functionality spewing forth from
        development.</p>
<p class="docText">Even with the pressure of developing our real product, much
        effort was spent pulling off one of our most impressive tricks:
        creating a software equivalent of the Turducken. The Candygram System
        (technically CS3) developed during the spring was completely unrelated
        to previous generations of the product. However, one of those previous
        generations had an implementation of a gas-specific billing module
        that the new version did not yet have. Apparently noticing they had
        the same name, ownership suggested that we port the gas-specific
        module to the new system, and in fact had promised that we would demo
        exactly that concept at an upcoming trade show. At first, the
        development team laughed at the idea, but the owner was serious, so we
        had to find some way for it to work. I'm ashamed to admit that I found
        a package of Windows API calls that enabled screens from a compiled
        Windows application to appear as child windows in our new system. With
        the "hard part" out of the way, all that was left was the not-so-minor
        issue that the systems were using completely different databases. A
        few hundred hours of development and data mapping made for a
        convincing-looking system, albeit one that resulted in no revenue, but
        the owners were not discouraged.</p>
<p class="docText">Their sales claims, and by extension, the company website,
        became a ripe source of joke material for the development team. A
        prime example is the following excerpt from an energy industry
        research firm's 2002 CIS report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">Candygram&#8230;Rock Ridge's flagship product, is an Internet-based,
          advanced software solution&#8230;Rock Ridge says that it has the
          functionality to manage all forms of energy including gas,
          electricity, oil, propane and other products and services such as
          water, telecom, security, and cable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">In 2002, the Candygram System was a Windows-based client/server
        system. The J2EE web-based version of Candygram was christened with
        the unintentionally dark but hilarious name "Candygram: The Final
        Solution" by Hedley at our first product planning summit. It
        remained a joke six years later, as each attempt to ramp up our Java&#8482;
        efforts was soon scuttled by another development emergency.</p>
<p class="docText">The claim that the Candygram System could "manage all forms of
        energy" still makes me laugh out loud. I can just picture one of the
        owners at a sales presentation listing all of the forms of energy, &agrave;
        la Bubba in <span class="docEmphasis">Forrest Gump</span>: "Gas energy, electrical
        energy, thermal energy, kinetic energy, chemical energy, nuclear
        energy, rotational energy, potential energy, gravitational energy,
        nervous energy, sexual energy&#8230;" That claim soon had me crafting a host
        of regular expressions to transmute our core gas module's VB and SQL
        code into whatever energy market was targeted that week.</p>
<p class="docText">But we still had hope, and all the "fun" things about the office
        and our group were now amplified by 80+ hour work weeks. Running jokes
        no longer had an evening or weekend to fade. They were handed off from
        shift to shift, becoming more twisted with each iteration and
        compounded by weeks of accumulated sleep deprivation.</p>

<p class="docText">Subject: November Blitz</p>
<p class="docText">November Blitz is over&#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">I first want to specially thank each of you for your
          exceptional effort. Not only did we "meet" the deadline, but we were
          able to produce two new modules with minimal issues. I would also
          like to recognize Stan Granite and The Sigh Guy for their effort in
          architecting and designing the new modules. This was a new
          experience and I believe the modules are better because of their
          involvement.</p>
<p class="docText">Second, I know that most of you have 80+ hours of comp-time.
          Please see to it that you use that time to do nothing, Recharge!
          First quarter of 2000 plans to be active and we need everyone
          thinking clearly. Mark Denovich has a spreadsheet that will be used
          to coordinate time off.</p>
<p class="docText">Third, for those of you who are at the office when others are
          recharging, we are not done improving the Gas, Work Order, and
          Transportation modules. We have a lot of reporting, interfaces, and
          polishing to complete. Succubus is very pleased with the Candygram
          System, we cannot afford to let up now. Our implementation team will
          be ensuring that Candygram System meets their needs and will work
          with the development staff through December and January to fix any
          glitches that may exist. I would like to have another installation
          of the Candygram System for Friday of this week.</p>
<p class="docText">Fourth, planning the end of November Blitz event. Originally
          we were planning a Penguins game or the like. Some of you mentioned
          that you would rather have meats and cheeses delivered to the
          office. The seven of you can vote on what the event should be (of
          course I have final approval). Please let me know the consensus as
          soon as possible.</p>
<p class="docText">Once again thank you, and Great Job!</p>
<p class="docText">No animals were harmed in making this
          message and only two exclamation points were used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">We not only worked hard, we played hard. We parlayed the
        end-of-Blitz event into a company-funded party at my house to coincide
        with the AFC/NFC championship games. We had gourmet food from all
        across the Internet, enough top-shelf booze to kill W. C. Fields, with
        the guest of honor being a 15 lb. USDA prime rib roast, flown in from
        Chicago.</p>
<p class="docText">The celebration turned out to be a bit premature. Against the
        odds, we met our customer's deadline, or so we thought. What we didn't
        realize is that while we were toiling away, the customer was also busy
        moving the goalposts.</p>
