<h3 id="title-IDAHUUYH" class="docSection1Title">30.6. The Break</h3>
<p class="docText">Attending virtually all the meetings on the Longjump project, I
        was in a position to hear the full range of the engineers'
        lamentations. After many weeks of sitting at vinyl-laminated tables in
        the blank-walled boxes of conference rooms, I felt overwhelmed by the
        burden of what I was taking in.</p>
<p class="docText">One day I broke it all to Alan. I expected a conventional "Buck
        up and carry on" speech, with a sprinkle of praise and commiseration
        from him, but Alan's response astonished me entirely.</p>
<p class="docText">"I think," he told me in his deliberate speaking style, into
        which he seemed to place each word with special consideration, "you
        should write up exactly what you told me and send it as an email to
        the entire company."</p>
<p class="docText">What a bizarre idea! Admittedly, in Edom Engineering's loose
        corporate culture, staff always felt comfortable using the companywide
        alias, which would instantly reach everybody from the manufacturing
        team to the CEO. The alias was used not only for official business,
        but to announce parties, reschedule soccer games, and exchange jokes.
        There was nothing sacred about the companywide alias.</p>
<p class="docText">But one could ask whether I had anything to
        say that deserved taking up people's time. Everything I told Alan had
        circulated freely in the halls. As I have already indicated, engineers
        stopped talking about these issues because they had held the
        conversation many times and felt it was over and done with.</p>
<p class="docText">Yet the thought of writing up my thoughts thrilled me. Every
        individual contributor felt the same away about Longjump, but each one
        felt it in isolation. They could not share feelings in any encounter
        group or therapy session (despite the provision of a corporate
        psychologist who did nothing). Living what we felt to be a lie, day by
        day, we had lost the tiny hold on sanity that our earlier grasp of the
        truth had left to us and were plummeting down a dark hole lined with
        impossible demands.</p>
<p class="docText">So it lifted my spirits to hope that all our frustrations and
        fears could be uttered once more. I think Alan could tell I was the
        one to put them into words. Not only was I a writer; my team leader
        responsibilities placed me at a little-noticed but crucial fulcrum in
        the exchange of information about the project.</p>
<p class="docText">I remember him expounding on his idea with his legs crossed
        casually and a straight-backed posture. He urged me not to pull my
        punches. "You laid out the problems that the teams faced very clearly
        when explaining them to me, and I encourage you strongly to be just as
        candid, just as direct, and just as uncompromising when you write it
        up for the company."</p>
<p class="docText">The course seemed dangerous, but by this time, any fear had been
        beaten out of me. Little thought of career repercussions entered my
        mind. I knew I had been appointed team leader because my work was
        respected, and in the middle of the crunch on this project, management
        couldn't afford to lose me or discipline me in any way. It was for
        Alan's safety more than my own that I asked him, "What will you say if
        top management complains?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Don't worry, I'll back you up completely, and I can't see any
        way management could take negative action." Delivered in the same
        modulated tone, Alan's words gave me complete confidence.</p>
<p class="docText">If I preserved the email I sent that afternoon, it must be on
        some format that few computer systems can read today, so I'm sorry to
        say I can't quote it directly. It was only a few paragraphs long. I
        wrote of a consensus among Longjump team members that the project had
        taken a wrong turn. I summarized the tasks remaining to be done over
        the next few weeks and the hurdles that various teams faced with
        performance issues, lack of knowledge about the platform, and
        incompatibilities. I then turned to the effect of our observations on
        team morale, ending with our love for our work, our customers, and our
        company, all of which we thought would be jeopardized by forcing us to
        stick to the current plan and schedule.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't believe much work got done in the facility the rest of
        the day. Printouts of my email went up on cubicle walls. People
        congratulated me in the hall with comments such as, "I showed this to
        my wife, and she asked how long it took before the person who wrote it
        got fired." Emails shot back from a sister facility in another state,
        where I was not well known, as people asked who this courageous and
        perspicacious writer was.</p>
<p class="docText">In fact, I don't feel this is at all a
        story about courage or perspicacity. I was not courageous because I
        had no expectation of harm. I was not unusually perspicacious because
        I merely reported what I heard from everyone, and I presented my
        observations from that standpoint.</p>
<p class="docText">What I do feel proud of&mdash;and thank Alan for pushing me to do&mdash;is
        to have given my colleagues a <a name="idx-CHP-30-0925"></a>voice. In doing this I broke through each individual's
        feeling of isolated panic, and fought the virulent sense of
        helplessness pervading the company. In giving them a voice, I allowed
        them to survive.</p>
