<p class="docText">The Software Development Center (SDC), while being in a prime
        location, was far from an ideal office environment. But then, lasting
        friendships are probably more often forged in a foxhole than in a
        corner office. On first inspection, we would now be working in a
        clean, well-lit, open-plan form office, complete with a dinette. There
        was plenty of natural light from the windows facing the main and side
        streets. We were on the second floor, conveniently located above a
        Bruegger's bagel shop. Parking was on-street, but free and not too
        hard to find in the surrounding blocks, a definite improvement over
        downtown. Next door was Fat Head's, our favorite bar and official hot
        wing vendor of the <a name="idx-CHP-28-0881"></a>Rock Ridge development team. What could be
        better?</p>
<p class="docText">A number of months after the move, another seismic event forever
        changed the office. It started like any other day. C$ was up to his
        usual antics, as he held court at the meeting table. This meant
        everyone within 50 feet was in his meeting whether they wanted to be
        or not. I can't remember the trigger, but J-Pax must have had his fill
        of being harassed by C$. It seemed like the office suddenly got quiet
        when I heard J-Pax say, "Fuck you, C$&#8230; I'm tired of this shit&#8230;and
        here's your fucking pen back." I may not have remembered the quote
        exactly, but I clearly remember the first office-launched F-bomb. I
        don't know what was holding us back to that point. J-Pax had seemingly
        opened some sort of Pandora's Box of swearing. Overnight, the standard
        office chat went completely blue.</p>
<p class="docText">The insanity of having one phone, located centrally but not
        conveniently, for everyone proved to be an interesting <a name="idx-CHP-28-0882"></a>social experiment. It would ring, and heads would begin
        popping above cube walls like prairie dogs to see who would be forced
        to answer it. Eyes would swivel back and forth, head fakes and false
        starts followed, before someone would finally cave. It was as though
        some evil genius had studied the book <span class="docEmphasis">Peopleware</span>
        and applied the opposite of all that was learned to create the
        ultimate productivity killer. When it wasn't disrupting "the flow" (a
        state of greatly heightened productivity that comes after
        approximately 45 minutes of uninterrupted effort) of almost everyone
        in the office, it served as a convenient petri dish for whatever cold
        or flu variant was in circulation.</p>
<p class="docText">Spending a few more minutes surveying the 50 x 50-foot office,
        you'd quickly realize that the 20 or so half-height cubicles were
        densely packed and were unlikely to provide much peace and quiet when
        fully populated. Who was going to get the two tall cubes, one on
        either side of the office? And that solitary cordless phone sitting in
        the middle of the office might seem a little worrisome. This is when
        you would finally take notice of the two doors on
        the far wall. One was a utility closet, and the other was
        <span class="docEmphasis">the</span> toilet. One toilet, with no vestibule or
        hallway. One closet-size toilet in full view of the office. Twenty
        people, living on a diet consisting chiefly of hot wings and coffee,
        relying on one toilet. This was going to get ugly.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: OK, I'm not quite sure I get this. Why's a
          toilet worth mentioning?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: It was the essence of
          working at <a name="idx-CHP-28-0883"></a>Rock Ridge.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Seriously? Was it like that when you first
          came on board?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: No. In fact, at the
          first office, shirt and tie was the standard, and it was a normal,
          boring downtown business office. That was the way Hedley wanted it
          run. And the first guy I was going to pick fights with or tease a
          lot wasn't going to be Stan&mdash;he was an imposing fellow, as he filled
          an entire cube.</p>
<p class="docText">We rarely saw C$ back then and the other characters who worked
          there at the downtown office were so boring that it wasn't even
          worth engaging them. It wasn't until we hit the South Side that C$
          started spending more and more time there and we were free from the
          office drones that it kind of just happened.</p>
<p class="docText">It was a way of diffusing tensions. C$ has a really strong
          ego, and so do I, and so does Stan. And when you're talking about
          something in a meeting, you have to let off that steam. Making fun
          of people was a way of establishing that we're all on the same page.
          C$ liked to throw his weight around, and had a fairly important
          title compared to the rest of us. But we could always keep him on
          our level by harassing him on a personal level.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: C$ didn't start
          treating us like human beings until we started ripping on
          him.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: But it's got to be more than poking fun. It
          sounds like you guys did this to an incredible extent. A lot of
          people would be driven to tears having to come in every day to the
          environment that you guys at Ridge Rock thrived in. Can we get to
          the bottom of that? And how did the toilet come into
          play?</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: The toilet was
          fertile ground for developing jokes. It was an ever-present actor,
          and that's why it came up a lot.</p>
<p class="docText">We wrote code and did our jobs in order to get back to making
          jokes about each other. That's the approach we took at meetings.
          "All right, let's stop for a minute and get some code done, so we
          can get back to so-and-so being a <span class="docEmphasis">[expletive
          deleted]</span>." And that's kind of how it went. As someone was
          speaking, you were either coming up with a new idea about the code,
          or a new idea to rip on somebody about. It just kept the meetings
          going. Our meetings were incredibly productive, I think, despite all
          of the constant interruptions. No one was ever in the meeting
          talking because they just wanted to talk. And if they were, they
          weren't talking about the product because they wanted to talk. They
          were talking about somebody's <span class="docEmphasis">[expletive
          deleted]</span>. I think that also kept our work focused. Real
          work only came up when the idea was so good
          that it warranted stopping the hilarity to talk about it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: People actually liked
          going to meetings, which is probably in contrast to every other
          company in existence. We actually liked to get together to meet and
          talk, because you knew that was going to happen. So, nobody dreaded
          going to meetings or tried to avoid them, because of the
          entertainment.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Nobody ever looked at
          a laptop when they were in a meeting.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: Exactly.</p>
<p class="docText">The other thing about the poop stuff was that it was sort of
          the Rosetta stone, the lingua franca of humor. If you have 10 people
          in the room, the one thing you know you can make a joke about that
          everyone's going to find funny is poo.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And that's where the toilet came
          in</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: So, the toilet
          actually came into the story before the incessant humor really
          emerged as the dominant culture on the team. We'd just come over to
          the South Side office, and we were dealing with the fact that 20 of
          us were all using the same toilet right in the middle of the office,
          in an open environment with no real walls or anything to limit the
          impact. It was the giant elephant in the room. It was something you
          couldn't <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> notice. And I think it was the
          initial pressure valve for us with talking about funny stuff. The
          first thing we could all agree about was that the toilet situation
          was pretty awful.</p>
<p class="docText">Everyplace else you work you hide the toilet. It's a safe
          place, and nobody talks about how you have to go there. At our
          office, it was in your face all the time. We could see the toilet
          door, we could see when somebody walked in, we could see when
          somebody walked out, and everyone knew exactly how long they were in
          there. There was no way to get away from it, and you were aware of
          it all the time&mdash;in every sense of the word. So, the subject would
          just come up. You can imagine that it had a huge impact on how we
          worked together as a team.</p>
<p class="docText">So, it started with the toilet, and pretty soon the jokes were
          flowing about progressively more off-color things. But the toilet
          was as far as it went with some people, because poop is a pretty
          safe subject.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: There were two pretty
          key factors there, if you step back from it. One, we couldn't have
          had that culture and camaraderie develop if we didn't have the South
          Side for it to incubate. There was no way that culture would have
          taken hold in the older, ice cube tray office, where the hallway
          door opened into Mark's cube, where we had all that terrible coffee,
          and where it was isolated: there was nothing around, no restaurants,
          no bars, nothing at all. But we moved to the South Side of
          Pittsburgh, where the developers were in our own office in a part of
          town that was a much more casual, 24-hour neighborhood where you
          could be there off-hours and still have things to do when you got
          off work. And it had the toilet. Without all that, the culture never
          would have loosened up and developed the way it did.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>:
          Nobody was there just to log time. It wasn't presenteeism. You were
          there because you wanted to be. It was either going to be funny, or
          you'd get work done so it could be funny when you were done. Or you
          were there because you were going to go out to a really good lunch
          or possibly dinner afterwards. Going to work was easy. And sometimes
          you'd actually say to yourself, "Man, I'm tired of making jokes, so
          let's do some work so we can reload." I think that's important to
          capture how critical the South Side&mdash;and the toilet&mdash;were. You were
          only ever really working for a short sprint at a time. You'd do a
          sprint, then go out to lunch, and do another sprint in the afternoon
          or evening. You weren't just sitting there watching the clock,
          because you could leave whenever you felt like it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: It was actually
          challenging. Whether it was ripping on each other or doing work,
          there were challenges there. It was a tough crowd, and you had to be
          on your game in order to not get destroyed when people were ripping
          on each other.</p>
<p class="docText">But we also had those ludicrous goals for our projects, and
          that was part of it. If we'd actually done the kind of stuff that
          "responsible" teams do regularly, where you plan the work first and
          take on projects that are realistic, it wouldn't have worked. There
          was a gallows humor around the kind of absolutely ridiculous demands
          that were put on us. I think it helped us bond against that external
          enemy&mdash;a ridiculous schedule for not very much money&mdash;that helped us
          all come together.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Somehow we were
          consistently being surprised by Hedley. Even though it was the same
          pattern over and over again, somehow we still managed to be
          shocked.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: It's like the frog
          that gets boiled slowly. "OK, I see you guys can make this deadline,
          so let's tighten it by a week."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Or cut a third of the
          team, and keep the same deadlines.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stan</span>: Let's let the
          negotiations for the contract drag on for three months, but keep the
          due date the same. Oh, that didn't faze you&#8230;we're going to give you
          three weeks to turn it into Spanish. You made that work? OK, now
          make it work in Pakistan for 25 times more customers than your
          largest previous installation. And we'd just deal with it with
          relentless humor, and somehow that made it work.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It almost seems like you took one obstacle
          after another&mdash;your terrible working environment, insane business
          deadlines, layoffs&mdash;and turned them into something that encouraged
          work, albeit not in a way that you'd read about in business
          school</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mark</span>: Right. You're not
          going to read in <span class="docEmphasis">Peopleware</span> that you should put
          a composting toilet heap in the middle of the office to help the
          team gel.</p>

<p class="docText">The daily unpleasant reminders of our limited sanitation
        facilities, combined with the office demographics, led to many
        scatological discussions. There were even meta-scatological discussions.
        The most infamous, after a particularly late programming session, led
        to some groundbreaking work in theoretical scatology. I believe the
        eureka moment was inspired by JDog, our technical writing manager, and
        the sole female employee willing to endure direct exposure to some of
        our more eccentric topics of debate. Exasperated, she noted that when
        there were enough guys in a conversation, sooner or later it
        invariably turned to the topic of poo. I had dreams of becoming a
        theoretical physicist, before my adviser at Carnegie Mellon University
        noted that my lack of academic rigor made me more suited to a career
        in computer science. Using Stan as a sounding board, I noticed
        striking similarities in the observed phenomenon to the implications
        of the Chandrasekhar and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limits in stellar
        astrophysics. The TOV limit is upper bound in the mass of neutron
        stars, beyond which the force of gravity will exceed the neutron
        degeneracy pressure with a subsequent collapse into a black hole.
        Similarly, I proposed that any conversation involving enough men will
        soon collapse under its own weight, forming a super-dense discussion
        from which no non-scatological discussion could escape, dubbed a brown
        hole. The theory has agreed well with considerable observational data.
        Possible refinements include factors to account for the apparent
        increased speed of the collapse in the presence of alcohol. Also,
        collapse may be prevented by having enough women in the conversation,
        but we have been unable to collect the necessary observational data to
        support the hypothesis.</p>
