<p class="docText">Following each use case elicitation workshop, the analyst
        supplies the documents he or she creates to the workshop participants.
        Such documents include use cases, portions of a growing SRS, graphical
        analysis models, data definitions, and other knowledge acquired during
        the workshop. The workshop participants then examine these materials
        informally on their own, looking for omissions, errors,
        misinterpretations, and any other issues.<a name="idx-CHP-19-0615"></a></p>
<p class="docText">And, boy, do we find a lot of problems this way! Sometimes, the
        analyst misunderstood something or put his own twist of interpretation
        on the requirements, which the users catch and correct. In other
        cases, a user realizes we overlooked an alternative flow for a use
        case. Or perhaps he concludes that an error condition should be
        handled in some different way than we originally envisioned. Sometimes
        the act of reviewing the requirements triggers an idea for some
        additional functionality that users would find helpful. These
        individual, incremental, informal, and inexpensive reviews greatly
        improve the quality of our growing body of requirements information.
        The types of problems we find also give us insights into how to
        improve our future requirements elicitation and specification
        activities. In addition, the reviews provide clear evidence to Paul
        and the other project stakeholders that we are making real progress on
        understanding and recording their requirements for the CTS.</p>
<p class="docText">The analysts on the team try different review approaches. I am
        holding workshops once per week with my chemists. Within two days
        following each workshop I deliver my write-up of the workshop outputs
        to the product champion and members of the backup team. Reviewing
        these materials helps anyone who missed a workshop get caught up. My
        users do a great job of finding errors, which they share with me at
        the beginning of the next workshop.</p>
<p class="docText">Our least experienced analyst, Devon, takes a different tack.
        He's holding daily workshops with his users, so he must quickly write
        up the workshop information and get it to the representatives to
        examine before they meet again the next day. This puts a lot of time
        pressure on the participants. More significantly, Devon reports that
        his users aren't finding many problems. Unfortunately, the problems
        are there; the reviewers just aren't catching many of them.</p>
<p class="docText">The insight here is that when you review a document shortly
        after thinking intensely about it (either while creating it as an
        author, or while contributing to it as a workshop participant),
        you don't really review the document&mdash;you mentally recite it. You're
        less likely to find problems than if you get some mental "settling
        time" before revisiting it. In contrast, when you come back to a
        document after a day or two, during which your short-term memory has
        faded, you look at it with a fresh perspective. You're more likely to
        spot disconnects, omissions, and other problems. Perhaps you've been
        mulling over the matter in the back of your brain for the past couple
        of days and you have some ideas for how to improve on the original
        work. Ever since I had this realization, I've always tried to set my
        own writing aside for at least 24 hours before I review it myself.
        This helps me look at it with a sharper eye than if I review it
        immediately after writing.</p>
