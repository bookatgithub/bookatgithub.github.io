<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Cory Doctorow</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH OF THIS WE CAN
      PULL OFF. TRY TO FIND A RESTAURANT THAT 10</span> friends can agree
      on, or a wedding plan that everyone will sign off on, and you run up
      against some hard limits of <a name="idx-CHP-12-0312"></a>collective action. By the time you hit the scale of a
      midsize company or a large family, it becomes apparent that an
      ever-larger slice of your "doing-stuff hours" must be devoted to
      "figuring out how to do stuff."</p>
<p class="docText">This is the transaction cost: the cost of getting stuff done, the
      overhead of getting everyone to agree on a restaurant, a course of
      action, or the truth. The cost of doing stuff that requires large groups
      of people and lots of labor is high enough that there's lots of stuff we
      don't even contemplate doing ("This weekend, my buddies and I are
      planning on whipping up a skyscraper!").</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-12-0313"></a>Transaction costs go by many names, like
      <span class="docEmphasis">overheads</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">red tape</span>&mdash;but at
      the end of the day, the correct term for them is
      <span class="docEmphasis">bullshitt</span>. As in, "There's no way I'm going to try
      to get the whole office to agree to that&mdash;do you know how much bullshit
      I'd have to wade through to get that done?"<a name="idx-CHP-12-0314"></a></p>
<p class="docText">As a society, we can only do stuff that produces more value than
      bullshit. The bigger the project, the more of the cost will be just
      bullshit.</p>
<p class="docText">But the <a name="idx-CHP-12-0315"></a>Internet clobbers overheads.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-12-0316"></a>WIPO is the <a name="idx-CHP-12-0317"></a>United Nations' World <a name="idx-CHP-12-0318"></a>Intellectual Property Organization. WIPO epitomizes the
      danger the Internet faces: a room full of diplomats meeting in Geneva in
      closed session, aggressively lobbied by the representatives of huge
      copyright and patent industries&mdash;and funded primarily by patent
      applications around the world, which means that these lobbyists
      represent the people who paid for the building they're meeting in. This
      is the veritable birthplace of bullshit.</p>
<p class="docText">Practically every rotten Internet regulation and law can be traced
      back to something that started at WIPO. WIPO has the same relationship
      to bad Internet rules that Mordor has to evil&mdash;a bottomless wellspring of
      dangerous foolishness backed by the power of one of the most powerful
      institutions ever created, the United Nations itself.</p>
<p class="docText">But in 2006, a multiyear, multimillion-dollar project to create a
      deadly new WIPO treaty collapsed under the onslaught of a tiny handful
      of activists who used the Internet to shatter the negotiations and
      replace them with a treaty that protected the public's rights to access
      and share human knowledge.</p>
<p class="docText">The <a name="idx-CHP-12-0319"></a>Broadcast Treaty was an attempt to create a new layer of
      bullshit for video: a copyright-like rule governing the use of broadcast
      material. The idea was to create a new right over broadcast content,
      separate from copyright, which would belong to a broadcaster.</p>
<p class="docText">Say that you recorded a clip of the local city council debating
      school funding last night and you caught your own councilor lying about
      her campaign promises&mdash;you've still got her brochure stuck to the fridge
      with a magnet, and right there she promises that she will not approve
      school funding cuts, period. Feeling betrayed, you decide to make a
      little YouTube video using the recording, interspersed with you talking
      about how that promise got you to vote for her.</p>
<p class="docText">Copyright law says that you have the right to do this. Taking a
      short clip for the purposes of political commentary, parody, analysis,
      teaching, and other protected uses falls under the banner of "fair use"
      (or "fair dealing" outside the United States).</p>
<p class="docText">But if the Broadcast Treaty became law, copyright would be
      irrelevant, because in addition to the copyright on the work, there'd be
      a "broadcast right" that the broadcaster would control. The fair use
      rules for broadcast rights would be different from the copyright rules,
      and that means that you'd need permission from the broadcaster where you
      never needed it before.</p>
<p class="docText">So, the Broadcast Treaty would overrule the exceptions to
      copyright, but it went much further than that. The broadcast right would
      also apply to material that <span class="docEmphasis">can't</span> be copyrighted.
      Only creative works get a copyright; factual material does not. Many
      countries don't allow for copyrights on government works (if your taxes
      are paying to produce it, why should you need permission to use it?).
      All of these works would also suddenly become the property of the
      corporation that broadcast them.</p>
<p class="docText">But most importantly from the <a name="idx-CHP-12-0320"></a>Internet's perspective was that the broadcast right would
      also override cases where creators had chosen to allow their works to be
      shared. The Internet is full of stuff that was made to be shared,
      copied, and remixed. A project called <a name="idx-CHP-12-0321"></a>Creative Commons provides free <a name="idx-CHP-12-0322"></a>licenses for sharing works, and in a remarkably short time
      (since 2003), more than <span class="docEmphasis">160 million works</span> have been
      released under these licenses, published by creators who want the public
      to be able to "rip, mix, and burn" the stuff they made with a minimum of
      bullshit. <a name="idx-CHP-12-0323"></a>Wikipedia's millions of words are governed by a similar
      license, the GNU Documentation License, that also allows for free
      sharing of the free encyclopedia.</p>
<p class="docText">But under the Broadcast Treaty, a corporation that broadcast (or
      "webcast") a Creative Commons licensed video would be able to prohibit
      you, the audience, from copying, mixing, or sharing the video,
      <span class="docEmphasis">even though the artist who made the video said it was
      OK</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="idx-CHP-12-0324"></a>WIPO is a huge, slow-moving juggernaut of an organization.
      Its meetings are attended by representatives of governments, many of
      them from poor countries that can't afford to send hundreds of experts
      on every subject to live in Geneva and participate in all the different
      UN agencies' treaty negotiations. Most of the delegates at WIPO are not
      experts on copyright, creativity, or economics; if they're from a poor
      nation, chances are that they're experts on agriculture or health, the
      kind of thing that a sub-Saharan country needs immediate action
      on.</p>
<p class="docText">So, these government delegations rely on "technical experts" from
      so-called "non-governmental organizations." Most of the world thinks of
      <a name="idx-CHP-12-0325"></a>NGOs as being groups like the Red Cross or Amnesty
      International, but at the UN, the term refers to any body that isn't a
      government. At WIPO, most of the NGOs are motion picture associations,
      broadcaster associations, pharmaceutical company associations, recording
      industry associations, publisher associations&mdash;the very people who stand
      to benefit from treaties that give more rights to companies that hold
      copyrights and patents.</p>
<p class="docText">This is the impartial, expert advice that WIPO relies on to make
      its treaties, so it's no wonder that every WIPO treaty has taken rights
      away from the public and handed them to companies.</p>
<p class="docText">But in 2003, all that changed. That was when UN observer
      credentials were granted to small coalitions of tech-savvy "<a name="idx-CHP-12-0326"></a>public interest" NGOs, like the Consumer Project on
      Technology (which initiated the antitrust action against Microsoft), the
      Electronic Frontier Foundation (which spent a decade winning legal
      battles over privacy and freedom online), and Public Knowledge, a
      DC-based organization that did a lot of lobbying at the FCC over freeing
      the airwaves.</p>
<p class="docText">The Broadcast Treaty negotiations had been underway for years at
      that point. A draft treaty had been widely circulated, and the big
      players&mdash;the United States, the European Union, and Japan&mdash;were all
      agitating for a speedy conclusion. Pretty much everyone in the room
      thought that the treaty was a good idea&mdash;and what's more, the committee
      in charge of the treaty had been threatened with being shut down unless
      it could get a treaty out the door soon. Everyone
      was rooting for the Broadcast Treaty to pass and for things to move
      on.</p>
<p class="docText">The public interest groups had almost no money (sending
      delegations all the way to Switzerland was extraordinarily expensive for
      these little nonprofits) and were untrained in the diplomatic style of
      negotiation. The first few hours of the meeting&mdash;seen on a big screen in
      a side room, as the public interest groups weren't given seats in the
      main room&mdash;were nearly impenetrably dull. Delegate after delegate rose to
      his feet and said things like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">Mr. Chairman, as I rise to take the floor for the first time in
        this session of the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related
        Rights, let me say how glad I am to have your hand on the tiller,
        steering us toward a speedy conclusion of this matter. My country's
        ministers have met recently on this matter and we wish to say that we
        are generally in accord with the current circulating draft,
        particularly in reference to proposals 0, R, and W. However, we are
        concerned that the inclusion of webcasting at this time may stand in
        the way of the speedy conclusion we are all hoping for and would like
        to hear from our learned friends about the possibility of moving the
        webcasting provisions to a separate appendix or addendum that would be
        optional and normative, but not binding&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">For hours.</p>
<p class="docText">The longer the activists sat there, the grimmer it looked. There
      wasn't even <a name="idx-CHP-12-0327"></a>Internet access at the meetings&mdash;it seems like any meeting
      about reforming the Internet that doesn't provide Internet access is
      really about destroying the Internet. Then they had an idea. Wendy
      Seltzer from the Electronic Frontier Foundation created a wireless
      network with her laptop and fired up a piece of shareware called
      SubEthaEdit, a program that lets multiple people edit the same document
      over a network.</p>
<p class="docText">Minutes later, all the activists in the room were logged into
      Wendy's computer, writing down everything that was said. One transcriber
      would type, another would correct typos, a third would add editorial
      notes about what it all really meant. Classic high-tech
      de-bullshitification: rather than passing around notes and marking them
      up and consolidating them, everyone just worked together, all at
      once.</p>
<p class="docText">At the dinner break, a few activists snuck up to the mezzanine
      where the public terminals were, and unplugged one from its Ethernet
      cable and plugged it into a laptop and uploaded the day's notes to the
      Internet. The activists blogged it&mdash;billing it as the first look inside a
      UN copyright treaty negotiation.</p>
<p class="docText">By the next morning, the meeting notes had been Slashdotted&mdash;that
      is, posted to the enormously popular geek news site, <a name="idx-CHP-12-0328"></a>Slashdot.com&mdash;and had gone from there to thousands of other
      postings. Millions of people read about the obscure machinations of a
      closed-door group in Geneva. The national delegations began to get phone
      calls from their capitals, either berating them for selling out their
      national interest, or congratulating them for taking a brave stand that
      was enormously unpopular at the meeting itself. One delegate recounted,
      "My capital called to say that a very important tech industry leader had
      called the ministry to tell them that he'd heard that our country was
      being very good here at the UN, having read about it on something called
      'slash-dot'."</p>
<p class="docText">Thereafter, the activists used twice-daily
      blog posts to recount the goings-on at <a name="idx-CHP-12-0329"></a>WIPO. These posts included editorial commentary and
      "human-readable" translations of the stilted, bureaucratic language that
      prevails at WIPO. They made fun of the technologically improbable
      predictions made by the delegates, and lionized the delegates who stood
      up for freedom.</p>
<p class="docText">The activists couldn't afford to take the national delegations out
      for fancy dinners or woo them at cocktail parties. Instead, they wrote
      daily position papers rebutting the other side's points, and then used
      bloggers around the world to translate them into several languages
      overnight so that they could be distributed the next morning before the
      meetings resumed. The UN administration suspended free photocopying for
      NGOs, a service they'd performed for the likes of the Motion Picture
      Association and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
      for decades. Now that activists were using the press to hold the UN to a
      standard of public accountability, it was off-limits.</p>
<p class="docText">Before long, a mysterious person or persons began to actually
      <span class="docEmphasis">steal</span> the activists' printed handouts off the
      literature table, vanishing great piles of papers that later turned up
      in the toilets and behind potted plants. The Secretariat ignored
      requests to ask one of the many guards in the lobby to keep an eye on
      the table&mdash;or to review the CCTV footage to see who was systematically
      sabotaging the dissemination of "expert opinion" at WIPO.</p>
<p class="docText">The rights-holder groups and the WIPO executive went ballistic.
      One representative of a rights-holder group threatened to sue for
      copyright violation because the activists had written down his testimony
      and published it without his permission. The Secretariat accused the
      activists of "violating the UN's hospitality" and threatened a ban on
      the dissemination of all printed material by NGOs.</p>
<p class="docText">But the blog posts kept going out. The activists also used ad hoc
      wireless networks to vet each other's prepared statements before they
      were delivered, becoming superhuman with the help of a network, each
      comrade helping the rest to hone their talking points so that the groups
      were able to act as a coordinated whole.</p>
<p class="docText">Activist groups all over the world heard about the goings-on at
      WIPO through the blog posts, and more and more turned up to each
      meeting. One day, the rights-holder representative who'd threatened a
      lawsuit over copyright violations approached me with a printed
      sheet.</p>
<p class="docText">"What's this?" I asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"It's what I'm going to say this afternoon. I just wanted to be
      sure that your record got my remarks down accurately."</p>
<p class="docText">Not long after, the delegates of a national government approached
      me. "You know, we've just been transferred into this branch of the
      diplomatic service&mdash;a departmental reshuffle. We tried to read the
      official accounts but, well, you know.&#8230;"</p>
<p class="docText">Indeed I did. The official reports from WIPO come out months after
      the meeting, are written in impenetrable bureaucratese, and are only
      published once every person "quoted" in them has
      had the chance to edit their remarks to remove anything they'd rather
      not have on record. Reading official WIPO transcripts makes memorizing
      the phone book seem exciting and glamorous by comparison.</p>
<p class="docText">"So, we tried to read the official transcripts, but we just ended
      up reading the reports the activists published. They're much clearer,
      you know&mdash;easier to follow."</p>
<p class="docText">From pariah to official biographer in just a few short years! The
      activists had fought WIPO's attempts to clobber the Net by using the
      Net&mdash;harnessing the low cost of collaboration and collective action to
      apply intelligent and unstoppable force. The other side
      <span class="docEmphasis">could</span> have used the Net to fight back, but they
      didn't; WIPO and the dinosaurs who back them have all the wrong
      intuitions about how the Net worked, and their efforts at grassroots
      Net-organizing are about as convincing as your old, white boss's
      attempts to rap at the company's boozy Christmas karaoke party.</p>
<p class="docText">Just how unstoppable was the force of Net-coordinated activists?
      The Broadcast Treaty was shelved by WIPO. In its place, WIPO elected to
      pursue a new treaty, one written by a broad group of activists,
      technologists, librarians, and geeks of all stripes, called the Access
      to Knowledge Treaty. Unlike all the other WIPO treaties, which spell out
      what the public <span class="docEmphasis">isn't</span> allowed to do with
      copyrighted works, A2K sets out the minimum set of information rights
      that every country has to give to its citizens, rights like the right to
      lend, to share, to make copies in special formats for disabled people,
      and to archive copies in libraries and national archives.</p>
