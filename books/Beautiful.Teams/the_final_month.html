<p class="docText">Meanwhile, back at the ranch, work on Da Bomb was starting to
        spill over into all areas of engineering. James Park was the point
        person on developing the user interface (UI) for the new My.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0169"></a>MP3.com service. He was faced with the unenviable (but
        not altogether unusual) task of developing a UI spec for a service
        which didn't exist yet, and more specifically, whose performance was
        unknown. This last bit was key: this was the only area of our website
        which would be doing live database queries, and the current prototypes
        were slow. Having our new, premier,
        best-thing-since-sliced-bread-how-did-I-ever-live-without-this service
        (My.MP3.com) be equated with "slow" was not acceptable in the eyes of
        management, and it was up to James to figure out how to design a
        workable UI which didn't require too much data from the database, and
        therefore minimized the DB query times. <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-7-FNOTE-4">[]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-7-FNOTE-4">[]</a></sup> IIRC, there were also some technical issues related to
            getting our homegrown XML-templating system to play nicely with
            XML data which was generated on the fly from live database queries
            and which didn't exist as a file on the filesystem, per se, but I
            may be misremembering.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">But an interesting thing happened here: James pulled in two of
        his cohorts from the design group&mdash;Brian Callahan and Nancy Bachman&mdash;and
        it soon became apparent that these folks were not invited to the
        party. It's not that they weren't technically competent or adding
        value to the project&mdash;they did all of that&mdash;it's just that they weren't
        part of the "Cool Kids Club" (yet). Or so it was presumed from the
        dirty looks when James pulled them into meetings, or the lack of
        invitations to these meetings in the first place! It was a wholly
        bizarre phenomenon which seemed to manifest itself fairly frequently
        at MP3.com: either you were a "<a name="idx-CHP-7-0170"></a>chosen one," in which case you could do no wrong, or you
        were one of the grunts who were put on whatever "this needs to get
        done, but it's not particularly sexy" task. No glory, just keeping the
        site up and running smoothly.</p>
<p class="docText">This had ramifications into how management worked, too. If you
        were the current "go to" person or manager, the high-profile projects
        flowed to you, and as long as you completed the project, you got more
        and more visibility. In the engineering department, would-be managers
        were constantly jockeying for position to become the next director or
        vice president, and this visibility was key to your ascension.</p>
<p class="docText">Of course, being able to successfully
        complete these tasks was all about the team that you assembled. If you
        managed to get the top performers, or the team that had mad chemistry,
        or the guy with the amazing skills, then the work came to you.
        Sometimes it came because the person on your team had the skills that
        were the best fit for the job, and sometimes it was just because you
        had performed well on the previous task, but it worked.</p>
<p class="docText">So, managers were constantly attempting to align themselves with
        the top performers so that they could succeed themselves. Any
        <a name="idx-CHP-7-0171"></a>management reshuffle resulted in a "kids in the
        schoolyard" scenario where first it was my pick, then your pick, then
        my pick again, without the overt trauma of waiting to see when you
        would be picked, but still with the knowledge that you had gotten
        dumped for someone "better" when things were reshuffled.</p>
<p class="docText">It was a mixed bag, moralewise, for the actual engineers. It was
        incentive to keep performing&mdash;"If I keep kicking ass, I'll keep getting
        the cool projects" or "If I work my ass off, maybe I'll get to work on
        this other project"&mdash;but could be crushing after you put in long hours,
        only to be shat upon. "I just worked 80-hour weeks for months and now
        you're going to reward me by putting me on the boring maintenance
        project? The hell with that &#8230;." <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-7-FNOTE-5">[]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-7-FNOTE-5">[]</a></sup> There were other incentives for high-visibility projects,
            with options being given as rewards for particular,
            <span class="docEmphasis">intense</span> projects, and they certainly helped
            morale, but in a slightly different way. <a name="idx-CHP-7-0172"></a>MP3.com also paid pretty reasonable wages to begin
            with, which should be taken into consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">While this reshuffling wasn't a constant thing, at least in
        engineering, it did seem to happen every 4 to 7.25 months, and one
        could never tell how it was going to turn out. A feeding frenzy would
        begin when a top manager would leave the company, or&mdash;more often&mdash;fall
        out of Michael's favor, and all of a sudden there would be a flurry of
        activity: existing top management huddling in a conference room,
        people being pulled aside to be asked "Would you like to work for me?"
        or "What do you think about managing a team of engineers?" and general
        upheaval, which you might miss if you weren't paying attention, but
        was there if you knew what to look for.</p>
<p class="docText">James probably rankled some egos by bringing people from
        "outside the fold" into the project&mdash;whether because they weren't in
        the right manager's group and therefore would be bringing prestige to
        someone else, or because of some never discussed elitism&mdash;but the three
        of them managed to get the job done. In fact, not only did they get it
        done, but the site was beautiful, and even more, sleek and slick from
        an end-user perspective. It just worked and was the way it should have
        been.</p>
<p class="docText">Over the course of the project, however, it became apparent that
        the most elegant way to solve a number of the problems at hand was to
        use <a name="idx-CHP-7-0173"></a>JavaScript. I can see you sitting there wondering where
        I'm going with this. Well, let's take a second to remember that the
        year is 1999, and while JavaScript is far from new, the implementation
        of JavaScript varies widely across the two or three major web browsers
        in existence.</p>
<p class="docText">And?</p>
<p class="docText">Well, the "and" is that we didn't use
        JavaScript at all on our website because, well, because there was no
        way we could provide a uniform user experience: different browsers
        supported different things, people were still browsing with JavaScript
        turned <a name="idx-CHP-7-0174"></a>off, and it was generally just a nightmare because you
        could never be sure what would and wouldn't work. It was already hard
        enough to make sure pages looked the same across different
        browser/architecture combinations, and adding a semisupported
        scripting language was just not in the cards.</p>
<p class="docText">But desperate times call for desperate measures, and we were
        making the great leap forward with our very "geek-oriented" service,
        using JavaScript to provide the best possible service. Once again, the
        beauty and power of this environment were peeking through: James
        checked in with the director of web design on using JavaScript and
        then ran with it, moving the entire My.<a name="idx-CHP-7-0175"></a>MP3.com site into a new and taboo realm.</p>
<p class="docText">The site was so beautiful, in fact, that said director of all
        things <span class="docEmphasis">visual</span> made the executive decision that we
        should redesign the entire website to match the branding of the
        impending My.MP3.com site &#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Curtain rises on the engineering department of
        MP3.com, currently living in cubicle land. It is almost midnight on
        the Friday before Christmas. Both the web team and the QA department
        have been working for more than 12 hours on the rebranded website,
        reporting bugs, tweaking templates, and generally trying to get the
        new design finished off. One web designer in particular, Brian
        Callahan, has probably not slept more than three hours a night for the
        past four days, often leaving at six in the morning as the director of
        his group is coming in to the office. But it's not just that he's
        bleary-eyed; he's also having visions of his wife filing for divorce,
        especially since their Christmas party is in full swing at his
        apartment 10 miles away, and he's still stuck here</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">Finally, Brian snaps: "Can anybody tell me why the
        <span class="docEmphasis">hell</span> this has to be done tonight?"</p>
<p class="docText">Blank stares &#8230;.</p>
<p class="docText">Finally, Medha Parlikar, the lead QA engineer, walks up behind
        him, gives his shoulder a quick rub, and says, "Yeah, we're all tired.
        It may be time to go home."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Curtain closes on Brian driving home, finally ready to
        celebrate &#8230; or fall over</span>.</p>
