<p class="docText">The type of individual, informal <a name="idx-CHP-19-0616"></a>peer review I described in the preceding section is
        called a <span class="docEmphasis">passaround</span>. Our <a name="idx-CHP-19-0617"></a>passarounds yield many improvements, but they aren't a
        substitute for the more rigorous type of team peer review, called an
        <span class="docEmphasis">inspection</span>. In an inspection, several
        participants examine the work product on their own and then pool their
        observations and questions in a meeting. The interactions that take
        place during the inspection meeting often result in discovering
        problems that no inspectors found during their individual
        preparation.<a name="idx-CHP-19-0618"></a></p>
<p class="docText">For <a name="idx-CHP-19-0619"></a>requirements specifications, inspections provide another
        advantage: the ability to catch ambiguities. An ambiguous requirement
        is one that can be interpreted in multiple ways by different readers
        (or sometimes even by the same reader). Suppose each inspector reads
        an ambiguous requirement on his own during a passaround review. The
        requirement makes sense to each of them, but it means something
        different to each of them. Each reviewer will say, "This is fine," and
        the ambiguity goes undetected. During an inspection, though, one
        member of the team called the <span class="docEmphasis">reader</span> describes in
        his own words what he thinks each requirement means. The other
        inspectors can compare the reader's explanation against their own
        understanding. Sometimes this reveals a difference of
        interpretation&mdash;an ambiguity&mdash;that could cause big problems if not
        caught until much later.</p>
<p class="docText">Given these powerful benefits, we decide to inspect our compiled
        SRS. Janet takes responsibility for editing together the partial
        requirements specifications and associated materials that the three
        analysts have developed. We end up with a 50-page SRS, with about
        another fifty pages of back matter, including analysis models,
        definitions, and other supporting information.</p>
<p class="docText">We invite our four product champions, our three analysts, and
        one additional project stakeholder to participate in the inspection.
        Eight is a fairly large inspection team. I have performed inspections
        for several years, so I serve as the moderator, which helps keep us on
        track. Devon serves as the recorder, logging the issues as they come
        up in the discussion. We realize that we can't possibly cover this
        volume of material in a single session, at least not if we're serious
        about scrutinizing it closely for problems. So we schedule three
        inspection meetings on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the same
        week, with a maximum duration of two and a half hours per meeting
        (this is still a fairly rapid inspection rate). Marathon review
        meetings are useless because after a couple of hours, tired eyes
        contribute little additional insight.</p>
<p class="docText">Our inspection is a success, at least if
        one measures success by the number of errors detected. Every error we
        fix now is one we won't have to fix later on at considerably greater
        cost and aggravation. Devon keeps running out of the room for more
        blank copies of the inspection issues log. It's a bit discouraging to
        find so many defects because we've all worked hard on the <a name="idx-CHP-19-0620"></a>requirements. But we also realize that each problem
        found at this stage is a "good catch."</p>
