<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">IN ANCIENT TIMES, THE BUILDER WHO WAS IN
      CHARGE OF BUILDING AN ARCH WOULD BE REQUIRED TO</span> stand under
      the arch when the supports were first removed. If the arch failed, it
      would come tumbling down on the builder. I felt a bit like the arch
      builder the first time I got on a Boeing 777 airliner. I had written
      some critical parts of the flight code and been part of a team that
      built the software tools that were used to build a large portion of the
      flight software for the plane. It's an amazing feeling to realize that
      your life depends on the quality of the software you have written. As
      with building the arch, the final product was not the result of one
      person's efforts. The builder would know the history of the project, and
      sometimes knowing what was done could make him quite nervous. Though I
      knew a lot of the background of the development of the flight systems
      and some of the problems encountered during development, I didn't have
      to be nervous like the arch builder. The airplane had undergone
      extensive flight testing before it was ever put into service. I wasn't
      the first to stand under the arch. It is exciting to board a plane,
      knowing that your team played a big role in helping to produce the
      flight software. The story I'm telling here is the story of the
      <a name="idx-CHP-23-0725"></a>HADS team, the team that built the compiler, runtime,
      linker, debugger, and other support tools used by the developers of the
      flight software for the Boeing 777. This small team developed, adapted,
      or maintained by the HADS team was roughly the same amount
      of code as for the entire 777 flight systems that had hundreds of
      developers. Every one of the project deadlines was met. Working on this
      team was one of the highlights of my software engineering career.</p>
<p class="docText">I suppose some teams start off beautiful and stay that way. I know
      that some teams start off ugly and stay that way. The <a name="idx-CHP-23-0726"></a>HADS team didn't start out as beautiful, and at the end,
      it just kind of faded away. But in the middle there, it was beautiful,
      and while it was beautiful, it was really beautiful.</p>
