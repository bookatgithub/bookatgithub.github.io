<h3 id="title-IDAJWHUW" class="docSection1Title">23.2. The Initial Team</h3>
<p class="docText">While sitting in my cubicle in the same area as the members of
        the <a name="idx-CHP-23-0736"></a>HADS team, I was able to observe the initial work of the
        team. The start-up was anything but promising.</p>
<p class="docText">Tom and Dave were the DDC-I consultants working on the project;
        Tom had been the project leader for the DDC-I I960 project. Among
        other things, Dave had played a vital role in one of the most
        difficult parts of the code generation process: the task of making
        efficient use of the registers on the hardware. None of the Honeywell
        engineers had any experience with building compilers other than
        perhaps in a class in school. Tom was not initially the project leader
        for the HADS project, but was always closely consulted.</p>
<p class="docText">Aside from setting up <a name="idx-CHP-23-0737"></a>initial schedules, the first major task was to analyze
        the differences between the Intel I960 and the AMD 29050 to try to
        understand what pieces of the previous project could be retained, what
        could be modified slightly, and what would need to be completely
        rewritten. Engineers from Honeywell were to do this work with
        consulting help from Tom and Dave. Chris was to analyze the
        architecture differences that affected linking. John was to look at
        the architectural impact on exception management. Cynthia looked at
        linking issues. Waleen looked at storage management issues. Ajit
        looked at issues related to Ada tasking. Ajit also looked into issues
        related to what is called the User Configurable Code, since it
        interfaces closely with the scheduling portion of Ada tasking. The
        engineers doing these analyses would be designers of these portions of
        the tool set. Implementation would use some additional Honeywell
        engineers, including Dan, Fred, Willis, and Henry.</p>
<p class="docText">It's interesting to observe how differently people work. From my
        nearby cubicle, I could get a lot of impressions of how things were
        going. John didn't ask for much help, and mostly studied documents by
        himself. Waleen usually didn't go to Tom and Dave for help. Since we
        had worked on the 7J7 documentation project together, she would often
        come to me to ask a question or two. Chris spent a lot of time with
        Tom, but mostly he would moan about how impossible his task was. Tom
        was not entirely sympathetic and would not take over Chris's task, but
        he would try to point out to him some areas that needed to be looked
        at and to point him to the documents where the information could be
        found. Fred was one of those guys who has a lot of great ideas, but
        then doesn't seem to follow through with them. I can remember several
        times thinking how glad I was to not be on that <a name="idx-CHP-23-0738"></a>team.</p>
<p class="docText">After a few weeks, John decided that he was not up to the task
        and asked to be moved to a different project. Because of my past
        experience documenting an Ada runtime, I was asked to take his place.
        In spite of my misgivings, and because it would not have been
        politically wise to refuse, I joined the team with my first
        responsibility being the exception management. The first meeting to go
        over the differences was not too far away at that time, but John had
        actually left behind some pretty good documentation. By the time of
        this first high-level design meeting, I was able to speak to the major
        architectural issues that would impact exception management. Still,
        the fact that I was given a late start on the project put this part at
        risk.</p>
<p class="docText">At this same meeting, Chris made his presentation on the
        architectural differences that would impact code generation. It was
        obvious to everyone at the meeting that he had done virtually nothing.
        He had clearly started with one of the DDC-I documents for the I960
        and made some editing changes. Frequently, entire sections were about
        the I960 with nothing said about the AMD 29050. In some places, it
        looked like he had just used the editor to substitute "AMD 29050" for
        "I960" and he made some statements that were clearly false. This was
        really bad, since generating code is obviously one of the most
        important parts of a compilation system. I guess I was too amazed by
        the presentation to remember much about the reaction at the meeting. I
        don't recall any direct criticism of Chris, but
        certainly errors and omissions in his presentation were pointed out.
        The meeting didn't do anything to increase my confidence in the
        <a name="idx-CHP-23-0739"></a>success of the project.</p>
<p class="docText">Dave later told me that as they were walking back to their
        cubicles, he and Tom were discussing how poorly Chris had performed.
        They couldn't believe the lack of progress. They decided to go to the
        section head for the Honeywell Software Tools group and have Chris
        removed from the project. Interestingly, Chris had gone straight from
        the meeting to ask to be removed from the project. Some other areas of
        analysis, while not quite this bad, also seemed to be in trouble. The
        first major deadline, being able to compile, link, and run a "Hello
        World" program, was in jeopardy. Many on the <a name="idx-CHP-23-0740"></a>team were not pulling their weight.</p>
