<h3 id="643999-918" class="docSection1Title">21.4. The Limits of the Contribulyzer</h3>
<p class="docText">There is a famous saying, much used in open source projects, but
        surely long predating them:<a name="idx-CHP-21-0670"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">The perfect must not be the enemy of the good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">The Contribulyzer could do much more than it currently does.
        It's really the beginnings of a complete activity-tracking system. In
        an ideal world, it would gather information from the mailing list
        archives and bug tracker as well as from the revision control system.
        We would be able to jump from a log message that mentions a
        contributor to the mailing list thread where that contributor
        discusses the change with other developers&mdash;and vice versa; that is,
        jump from the mailing list thread to the commit. Similarly, we would
        be able to gather statistics on what percentage of a given person's
        tickets in the bug tracker resulted in commits or in non-trivial
        discussion threads (thus telling us that this person's bug reports
        should get comparatively more weight in the future, since she seems to
        be an effective reporter).</p>
<p class="docText">The point would not be to make a ratings system; that would be
        useless, and maybe even destructive, since it would suffer from
        inflationary pressures and tempt people into reductively quantitative
        comparisons of participants. Rather, the point would be to make it
        easy to find out more about a person <span class="docEmphasis">once you already know
        you're interested in her</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">Everyone who participates in an open source project leaves a
        trail. Even asking a question on a mailing list leaves a trail of at
        least one message, and possibly more if a thread develops. But right
        now these trails are implicit: one must trawl through archives and
        databases and revision control histories by hand in order to put
        together a reasonably complete picture of a given person's
        activity.</p>
<p class="docText">The Contribulyzer is a small step in the direction of automating
        the discovery of these trails. I included it in this chapter as an
        example of how even a minor bit of automation can make a noticeable
        difference in a team's ability to collaborate. Although the
        Contribulyzer covers only revision control logs,
        it still saves us a lot of time and mental energy, especially because
        the log messages often contain links to the relevant bug-tracker
        tickets and mailing list threads&mdash;so, if we can just get to the right
        log messages quickly, the battle is already half-won.</p>
<p class="docText">I don't want to claim too much for the <a name="idx-CHP-21-0671"></a>Contribulyzer; certainly, there are many aspects of
        running an open source project that it doesn't touch. But it
        significantly reduces our workload when evaluating potential new
        maintainers, and therefore makes us more likely to do such evaluations
        in the first place. For one day's investment in coding, that's not a
        bad payoff.</p>
<p class="docText">Writing metacode rarely feels as productive as writing code, but
        it's usually worth it. If you've correctly identified a problem and
        have seen a clear technical solution, then a one-time effort now can
        bring steady returns over the life of the project.</p>
