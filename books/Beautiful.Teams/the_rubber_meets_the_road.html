<p class="docText">We decided to use our next team meeting to review the
        instrumentation and performance issues in the code. I played the role
        of scribe, since I didn't know enough about the code to usefully
        comment. In preparation for the meeting, I suggested the team consider
        reading the code out loud and that we plan to spend two hours on the
        review. I added a note at the bottom of the email: "Remember, don't
        tell anyone we're doing this long of a code review&mdash;Big Cheese will
        have my head." At the time I thought I was joking.</p>
<p class="docText">We slowed that code review down to a crawl. After two hours,
        we'd gone through 15 of the 30 pages. Fred had a number of ideas about
        how to re-instrument the code, but no ideas about how to work faster.
        We'd been at this for two hours and had no more mental energy.</p>
<p class="docText">"Let's stop this for today," I suggested.</p>
<p class="docText">"No, we can finish," Sam said.</p>
<p class="docText">Tim, a.k.a. "Silent Man," piped up. "Sam, no."</p>
<p class="docText">"No?"</p>
<p class="docText">"No way. We're tired. We've been focusing
        on this code <a name="idx-CHP-27-0865"></a>and the instrumentation, and it's gotten us somewhere.
        But just spending more time right now isn't going to help. We need a
        little distance and a break. I need a bike ride."</p>
<p class="docText">"Look, Tim, I know you get all these great ideas on the bike,
        but&mdash;"</p>
<p class="docText">"No, I'm learning. So are you. JR, can you book us a room for 10
        to 12 tomorrow? I think we can finish then. And if not, we'll figure
        out what to do next. Sam, listen to me. Go play with your dog or work
        out or take a shower or something. But do not look at this code
        anymore. Got it?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Uh, sure." Sam looked shell-shocked.</p>
<p class="docText">As Tim left, Dan chuckled. "Sam, you didn't realize that Tim is
        really the power behind this group? Time you learned."</p>
<p class="docText">I booked a conference room and emailed the ideas we had so far
        to the group, as well as the conference room location for the next
        morning. The only problem was, it was on Exec Row, near the senior
        management offices.</p>
<p class="docText">At home that night, I explained to my husband what I was doing.
        "Honey, remember that conversation about code review I told you about
        a couple of weeks ago?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Yup."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, we're doing a two-hour review tomorrow right near Big
        Cheese's office. I might be home early, looking for a job."</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, it won't be the first time you've been fired, will
        it?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I prefer the term <span class="docEmphasis">layoff</span>. That's what it
        was."</p>
<p class="docText">"Oh, fine. Just start on your resume tonight. Oh, and call me at
        lunch to tell if you're still employed."</p>
<p class="docText">The next day, we all arrived at the conference room and started
        on <a class="docLink" href="ugly_talent.html#ugly_talent">Section 2.1</a>. We made some progress. At 10:40,
        Big Cheese barged in.</p>
<p class="docText">"Johanna, what are you doing? This looks like a code
        review."</p>
<p class="docText">"Does it? We're trying to figure out how to make up time on the
        project. We don't have a plan yet, but we're getting there."</p>
<p class="docText">"Glad to see you've come to your senses. You knew I was
        right."</p>
<p class="docText">After he left, everyone cracked up. Tim was the first to speak.
        "JR, you can't play poker, but you can lie without blushing?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I told the truth&mdash;at least, partially. We are working on a plan.
        It's just that we're using a tool he doesn't like." Everyone laughed
        again. "OK, let's get back to this."</p>
<p class="docText">By noon, we had two more suggestions for
        instrumentation, <a name="idx-CHP-27-0866"></a>and one suggestion for changing the code. Fred and Tim
        were developing their inch-pebbles, coordinating who would do what,
        and promised to let me know by the end of the day what their plan
        was.</p>
<p class="docText">I spent some time reviewing the schedule and floated the idea of
        a <a name="idx-CHP-27-0867"></a>phased release to the team. We could release the new
        feature set on time, and release the performance enhancements two
        weeks later. I asked the team to consider that as an option we could
        discuss at our next team meeting.</p>
