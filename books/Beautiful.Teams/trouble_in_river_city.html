<p class="docText">Things were going great until one ominous Monday morning. Wally,
        our newest engineer, showed up unannounced and with an attitude. He
        had some history with Ellen, and right away he started with a rude
        form of humor, cutting deep into her. After I told him to cut it out,
        he insisted he was kidding, but you could see it hurt her. The
        knifelike kidding did not stop.</p>
<p class="docText">Big companies have this bad habit of treating people like parts
        in a machine. The first sign is referring to people as
        <span class="docEmphasis">resources</span>. Someone in management thought that
        Wally was a plug-replaceable <a name="idx-CHP-15-0418"></a>programming unit. Through some magic of "resource
        availability" and project priority, we got Wally this fateful
        morning.<a name="idx-CHP-15-0419"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Wally was bright, but he had no idea what our team culture was.
        Our team was <a name="idx-CHP-15-0420"></a>collaborative, and we were excited about taking on the
        process and technical challenge the project offered. All the team
        members identified with the team, and wanted to be part of it and to
        live by the standards and work ethic we had adopted. Wally did not get
        or want to get why we were writing tests. He did not get why we were
        not doing a big design first. He did not get the short iterations and,
        surprise: he was no suitable pair partner. His
        <span class="docEmphasis">humor</span> disrupted standup meetings and pair
        programming sessions.</p>
<p class="docText">I recognized right away that Wally was not going to work out.
        Fred wanted us to try to integrate him into the team. We tried, but
        sand does not go well with contact lens cleaner&mdash;it's too abrasive. In
        the end, Fred saw it our way and got him off our team. In the short
        time he was with us, our morale and output dropped.</p>
