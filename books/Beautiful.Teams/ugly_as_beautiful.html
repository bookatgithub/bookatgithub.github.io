<h3 id="title-IDAPMEFP" class="docSection1Title">2.2. Ugly As Beautiful</h3>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Beautiful</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">ugly</span> are
        tricky words to apply to groups of people. If I say the Mona Lisa or
        Mount McKinley is beautiful, I'm claiming it is attractive or well
        crafted: I'm making an aesthetic judgment of an object we can
        collectively observe. I can point to it, describe it, throw tomatoes
        at it, or even allow you to compare your judgment of the thing as seen
        by your eyes with how I describe what I see in mine. I do believe
        beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but two people with different
        eyes are still talking about an object that exists outside of either
        person. However, to claim that a team, a club, or even a nation is
        beautiful makes less sense. A team is defined by a set of
        relationships between people, and relationships don't exist as
        physical things. Judging the aesthetics of non-physical things
        stretches the entire idea of aesthetics. It puts beauty not in the
        eye, but in the mind, where we cannot collectively observe the same
        thing. Rupert, the team captain, will have one sense of what the team
        is, while Cornelius, the team mascot, will have another. And
        certainly, people playing on a competing team will have a third. And
        none of them can point to "the team" as a point of reference with the
        same certainty they could about the Mona Lisa or Mount
        McKinley.<a name="idx-CHP-2-0032"></a></p>
<p class="docText">The only use of beauty <a name="idx-CHP-2-0033"></a>applied to teams that makes sense is the Japanese
        concept of <span class="docEmphasis">wabi-sabi</span>. Roughly,
        <span class="docEmphasis">wabi-sabi</span> means there is a special beauty found
        in things that have been used. That pair of shoes you love because
        they've been broken in, and have carried your feet on long walks on
        the beach, has a beauty no new pair of shoes could ever have. Even if
        those shoes were dirty, scratched, and beat up in a way that no person
        looking to buy a new pair for himself would ever call beautiful,
        they'd maintain a <span class="docEmphasis">wabi-sabi</span> kind of beauty to
        you.<a name="idx-CHP-2-0034"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Sometimes the way something wears out can be beautiful to
        everyone. Find the oldest building in your neighborhood, the oldest
        tree in the nearest park. There is a majesty that comes
        from how something ages that depends on the imperfections it has
        collected over time.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-2-FNOTE-4">[]</a></sup> Anyone who prefers to buy used things in part because of
        how they look has an appreciation for <span class="docEmphasis">wabi-sabi</span>.
        In this sense, the <a name="idx-CHP-2-0035"></a>ugly teams I described at the beginning of this chapter,
        the underdog, the misfit, represent the <span class="docEmphasis">wabi-sabi</span>
        teams. These are groups that share scars, have failed together and
        recovered together, and are still fighting as a team. And it's only
        through those experiences that a team can develop a character that has
        any approximation of beauty.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-2-FNOTE-4">[]</a></sup> During the recent renovation of the Parthenon in Greece,
            they considered restoring the building to what it would have
            looked like when built. But they decided instead to restore it to
            the ruin it is, as the aesthetic of the exposed stone and worn-out
            marble better fits our expectations for what the building should
            look like. <span class="docEmphasis">Wabi-sabi</span> trumped new and
            shiny.</p></blockquote>
