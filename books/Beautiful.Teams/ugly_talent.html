<h3 id="title-IDACBZUF" class="docSection1Title">2.1. Ugly Talent</h3>
<p class="docText">Many so-called beautiful teams were never described in those
        words by the people on them. Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth, members of
        perhaps the greatest sports team in history, the 1927 Yankees,
        despised each other. America's founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson and
        John Adams, feuded regularly, in public and in
        private. Many great music bands, such as The Supremes, The Doors, The
        Clash, The Beatles, and even Guns N' Roses, lasted only a few years
        before they tore each other apart.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-2-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> We love the simple idea that only a beautiful person, or
        a beautiful team, can make something beautiful. As if Picasso wasn't a
        misogynistic sociopath, van Gogh wasn't manic-depressive, or Jackson
        Pollock (and dozens of other well-known creatives and legendary
        athletes) didn't abuse alcohol or other drugs. Beauty is overrated, as
        many of their works weren't considered beautiful until long after they
        were made, or their creators were dead (if the work didn't change,
        what did?). Most of us suffer from a warped, artificial, and
        oversimplified aesthetic, where beauty is good and <a name="idx-CHP-2-0024"></a>ugly is bad, without ever exploring the
        alternatives.<a name="idx-CHP-2-0025"></a></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-2-FNOTE-1">[]</a></sup> Until a decade passes and the revenue potential outweighs
            their mutual hatred. See <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.spinner.com/2007/08/10/20-bitter-band-breakups-smashing-pumpkins/"></a>
            for a longer list of famous band breakups.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Michael Lewis's 2003 bestseller, <span class="docEmphasis">Moneyball: The Art of
        Winning an Unfair Game</span> (W. W. Norton &amp; Company),
        explored the biases of the Oakland A's <a name="idx-CHP-2-0026"></a>baseball scouts when evaluating the ability of new
        players. Instead of focusing solely on results, the ability of a given
        individual to hit baseballs, or to throw them so that others cannot
        hit them, professional scouts were heavily influenced by appearance.
        Overweight, short, or seemingly uncoordinated players were overlooked
        despite statistics demonstrating their <a name="idx-CHP-2-0027"></a>talents. Billy Beane, the Oakland A's general manager,
        revolutionized how the potential of a player was measured and closed
        the gap between what we expect talent to look like and what it
        actually is. He forced people to move past their preconceived
        expectations and to seek out less subjective measures of talent. Ugly
        players, or good-looking players who played "ugly" but got results,
        had more value than the league thought they did. His honest look at
        what mattered in baseball changed the way many professional sports
        teams evaluate and scout for players.</p>
<p class="docText">Similar to what baseball scouts were like before Bean's
        influence, we all have firm beliefs about people that we cannot
        justify. Over a lifetime, we passively develop an image of how a great
        athlete, a trustworthy doctor, or a brilliant programmer should dress,
        talk, or behave, and those images shape our opinions more than we
        realize. When it comes to teams, most of our memories of what a good
        team should look and feel like come from television shows and
        movies.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-2-FNOTE-2">[]</a></sup> Few <a name="idx-CHP-2-0028"></a>heroes and legends in real life were as attractive and
        cool as the stars who play them, and rarely did their development as
        individuals, or as teams, proceed in a neat little narrative easily
        described in 90 minutes of entertainment. Films like <span class="docEmphasis">The
        Natural, Saving Private Ryan</span>, or even <span class="docEmphasis">The
        Matrix</span> skip past all the messy, ugly struggles of how teams
        form and grow, presenting us only with tales of how successful,
        good-looking teams adopt a talented, and beautiful-looking, leading
        character.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-2-FNOTE-2">[]</a></sup> Yes, I'm aware I mentioned the films <span class="docEmphasis">The Bad News
            Bears</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">Rocky</span>. Even the best
            points have a few exceptions.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Pop quiz: given the choice between two job candidates, one a
        prodigy with a perfect 4.0 GPA and the other a possibly brilliant but
        "selectively motivated" 2.7 GPA candidate (two As
        and four Cs),<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-2-FNOTE-3">[]</a></sup> who would you hire? All other considerations being
        equal, we'd all pick the "<a name="idx-CHP-2-0029"></a>beautiful," perfect candidate. No one gets fired for
        hiring the beautiful candidate. What could be better, or more
        beautiful, than perfect scores? If we go beneath the superficial,
        perfect grades <a name="idx-CHP-2-0030"></a>often mean the perfect following of someone else's
        rules. They are not good indicators of passionate, free-thinking,
        risk-taking minds. More important is that a team comprising only 4.0
        GPA prodigies will never get <a name="idx-CHP-2-0031"></a>ugly. They will never take big risks, never make big
        mistakes, and therefore never pull one another out of a fire. Without
        risks, mistakes, and mutual rescue, the chemical bonds of deep
        personal trust cannot grow. For a team to make something beautiful
        there must be some ugliness along the way. The tragedy of a team of
        perfect people is that they will all be so desperate to maintain their
        sense of perfection, their 4.0 in life, that when faced with the
        pressure of an important project their selfish drives will tear the
        team apart. Beautiful people are afraid of scars: they don't have the
        imagination to see how beautiful scars can be.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-2-FNOTE-3">[]</a></sup> Disclosure: the author's GPA may possibly resemble the one
            described here.</p></blockquote>
