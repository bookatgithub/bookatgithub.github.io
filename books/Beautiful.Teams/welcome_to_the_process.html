<h4>Step Inside, Step Inside, and See the Show</h4>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Ned Robinson</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">IT WAS APRIL 2001, AND THE GRAY SKIES OF
      WINTER IN NEW YORK WERE GIVING WAY TO THE CRISP</span> blue skies of
      spring. A 20-year programming veteran, I had spent the previous 5 years
      running the software division of RePlay Technologies, a music software
      company. The company had done relatively well for a small start-up, but
      after five years of almost breaking even, RePlay was sold and I was out
      of a job. So here I was, back in the financial district of NYC looking
      for a job.</p>
<p class="docText">My first few interviews proved that the American corporations had
      not changed their software development practices during the previous
      five years. They were still paying little attention to formal <a name="idx-CHP-25-0767"></a>processes and good project management. Every company I
      interviewed with sang the same refrain: work 60 to 70 hours a week,
      projects will succeed because of your superhuman efforts (red cape and
      beeper will be handed out on first day of job), and yes, expect the
      sponsor to be changing requirements constantly. When can you
      start?</p>
<p class="docText">The problem was that I no longer wanted to be a superman
      developer. I had done that for too long already and was burned out. I
      hadn't minded when I was still in my 20s and trying to make a name for
      myself in the industry. Whatever the project, whatever the obstacles, I
      had spent many sleepless nights writing line after
      line of code to accommodate incomplete and half-articulated and
      thought-out requirements that lasted only until the boss came in the
      next morning with some new ideas that wiped out 80% of the work I had
      just done. The adrenaline rush of handing my boss a working program with
      the changes he had requested the night before as he left the office had
      long ago lost its luster. I no longer wanted to live in the world of
      constant scope creep. I no longer wanted to be part of a team of
      half-asleep, over-jolted programmers.</p>
<p class="docText">All of these thoughts were in my mind as I entered the lobby of
      the World Trade Center, Building 2, for an interview with Benchmark, a
      small software company that specialized in desktop stock evaluation
      software for asset and portfolio managers. I rode the elevator up to the
      sky lobby on the 78th floor and entered the office.</p>
<p class="docText">The offices were beautiful. Spreading out on a portion of the 78th
      floor and the entire 77th floor, everywhere I looked I saw unobstructed
      views of the most incredible New York City vistas. As I walked up to the
      reception desk, I could see the Statue of Liberty from the window on the
      right. This was a pretty cool environment, I thought, from a physical
      standpoint. I was hoping that the job lived up to the surroundings.
      After checking in with the receptionist, I awaited the arrival of the
      software development manager.</p>
<p class="docText">When Curt arrived at the reception desk, I was quite surprised
      (and equally excited) by his dress and demeanor. He was dressed in black
      jeans, a button-down collared black shirt, and black army boots. He had
      his straight black hair pulled back in a ponytail and there was a 2-inch
      streak of purple hair on the right side. An earring completed the
      picture. All of a sudden, I had hope that this job might offer something
      different from what I had been imagining.</p>
<p class="docText">Curt and I went down to his office on the 77th floor. His office
      was littered with all kinds of hardware, hard drives, motherboards,
      memory chips, and so on. Our conversation started off easily as I
      related my work history. It turned out that Curt was also a musician,
      having played cello in school and now playing bass in a punk band. We
      talked about music and about how I developed a suite of music <a name="idx-CHP-25-0768"></a>processing algorithms for RePlay Technologies. We shared
      war stories about writing code in beta versions of Microsoft compilers,
      about writing 16-bit code in a limited memory model, and how to handle
      users who always seemed to wait until you were just about finished to
      ask you to add just a few more fields (to all the screens and reports).
      We even spent a few minutes discussing the pros and cons of FORTH and
      reverse polish notation.</p>
<p class="docText">He then told me about the development team that he was managing
      and the process <a name="idx-CHP-25-0769"></a>reengineering that he had already started. This is getting
      interesting, I thought. He told me about getting his undergraduate
      degree at Carnegie Mellon, the home of <a name="idx-CHP-25-0770"></a>CMMI (the Capability Maturity Model Initiative) and his
      efforts to date to bring the company to Level 2 compliance on the CMMI
      scale. After he concluded his very brief introduction of CMMI, he said
      the following sentence that won me over even before the job was offered:
      "If you ever have to work more than 40 hours a week, then I have failed
      at my job as manager. You have not failed at yours. My job is to hire
      good people and stand back and let them do the job
      that they were hired to do. For software developers, this means
      department or companywide adoption of time-proven <a name="idx-CHP-25-0771"></a>processes and methodologies that clearly define all
      project work and scope and have a strong change management
      component."</p>
<p class="docText">Wow! Was the ground going to break open and swallow him up for
      blasphemy? Did he just say there is a way to manage scope creep? Could
      any more noble words come from a boss's mouth? Did he really have senior
      management buy-in for this? While I still had a lot of questions, so far
      this looked like the job for me. Over the next couple of days, I met the
      members of the development team, and took a technical test, a
      personality assessment, and a drug test. Within a week, I had a new
      job.</p>
<p class="docText">I was the fourth developer on the software development team. The
      team worked well together, and each member had a particular area of
      strength that the other team members relied on. Mary was great at
      developing user interfaces. Dmitri was the bit guru and wasn't scared of
      getting down and dirty with the code. Peter liked decomposing the
      business requirements and creating the software development plan. I was
      intimately familiar with Windows internals, object-oriented design, and
      multitiered architecture. We all had our strengths and would prove to be
      the nucleus of a growing team that worked well together and loved
      writing code.</p>
<p class="docText">The team also worked well with the other departments in the SDLC:
      business requirements, quality assurance, project management,
      operations, and frontline business users. They worked so well together
      that one of the developers married one of the QA testers. In the spirit
      of continued family harmony, we did our best not to put them on the same
      project!</p>
<p class="docText">There was a spirit underlying the entire company that created a
      really positive work environment. Many of the approximately 200
      employees had been with the company for 5 to 10 years. was All of them
      were committed to seeing the company grow and to feel like they were a
      part of it. This was promoted from the top level of the company down.
      Customer milestones were tracked, and whenever a new milestone was hit
      (every 100 new desktops or 10 new customers), each employee received a
      wooden plaque and a crisp $100 bill. For those who had been with the
      company for a long time, their cubes were proudly tiled with plaques
      from floor to ceiling.</p>
<p class="docText">Things were good at Benchmark. While the company had been bought
      by a large financial information firm, Benchmark was still operating
      pretty much independently, although rumors abounded about being folded
      into the larger corporate family. But, at the moment, Benchmark would be
      able to follow its own processes and methodologies.</p>
<p class="docText">My first project was to write a program that continuously
      monitored critical backend data collection processes. The program was to
      check that data was flowing into the company's servers from a number of
      data providers and that the data was being automatically converted,
      saved, and made available for redistribution to our customers. It also
      had to make sure that the delayed security price request system was
      working and providing accurate quotes. This Watchdog program updated a
      frontend monitoring program that Dmitri had written and that ran on an
      IT workstation 24/7.</p>
<p class="docText">As I started to write my use cases, I began
      to understand why Benchmark had such a bad record of <a name="idx-CHP-25-0772"></a>delivering quality software on time and to spec. In order
      to write this Watchdog program, I had to know what each system being
      monitored was supposed to do. As I looked for information on each
      system, I discovered that many of the systems had no documentation or
      that the documentation had been a preliminary specification that in no
      way matched the final deliverable. For example, the data files from one
      vendor had to be converted to a specific layout with a checksum added to
      each row and to the end of the file. Unfortunately, the final data
      layout of the imported file had been changed by the vendor and fields
      were added to both the middle and end of the data structure. Since I had
      to check specific fields and compute a checksum, I had to make sure that
      I was reading the right fields. To make matters worse, the developer who
      had originally written the import program was no longer with the
      company. I tried talking with Nancy, the head of the department that
      managed the data feeds. Unfortunately, she had no patience for
      <a name="idx-CHP-25-0773"></a>requirements gathering and told me that she didn't have
      time to discuss it and to just figure it out myself. In the end, I had
      to do just that: open the import source code and decipher what was going
      on.</p>
<p class="docText">I continued to hit these types of walls as I worked to complete my
      use case analysis. The only smooth part of the requirements gathering
      was when I had to figure out how to interface to Dmitri's monitoring
      frontend. When I asked Dmitri how to do it, he sent me a link to the
      complete and up-to-date API spec! With a complete requirements document
      in hand, I was able to finish the Watchdog program a few days before my
      required delivery date.</p>
<p class="docText">As this project was coming to a close, Curt assigned me to work on
      another internal project for Benchmark. One feature of the software was
      to track the comings and goings of all the top Wall Street executives:
      what companies they worked for, their previous and current titles,
      promotions, salaries, bonuses, and so forth. Curt gave me a rough draft
      of a requirements document that Nancy's team had given him: a one-page
      brief description and a couple of hand-drawn screens. A kickoff meeting
      was scheduled for the following week.</p>
<p class="docText">As the meeting began, all of the participants were introduced.
      Nancy had brought six members of her staff to the meeting while all the
      other departments had one or two representatives. One of Nancy's
      assistants introduced the purpose and scope of the project. After they
      finished, Curt asked Nancy when her team was going to deliver the
      completed requirements document. Nancy said that she felt what she had
      delivered was enough to understand all of the requirements of the
      project and that they were too busy to do any more writing or analysis.
      Since there were no business analysts available to work on this project,
      the software developer would just have to figure it out himself. Curt
      and I looked at each other with shock and dismay. We couldn't believe
      that she was serious. Curt made some comments about what Nancy had
      promised to deliver and Nancy made some counter comments about how the
      software developers had to be nimble and be able to go with the
      flow.</p>
<p class="docText">Curt stood his ground and told Nancy that the
      project would be on hold until more requirements were available. Curt
      wasn't going to cave in like other managers I have had in the past. At
      that point, the project manager ended the meeting and said that it would
      have to be continued after the issues with the requirements had been
      discussed offline. As we left the conference room, I smiled as I
      realized the street credit that Curt had just gotten.</p>
<p class="docText">As summer 2001 was coming to a close, I felt at home at Benchmark,
      like I had always been a part of the team even though I had worked there
      for less than six months. As I arrived at work one morning in late
      August, I walked off the elevator and was greeted with an incredible
      view of the Statue of Liberty framed against a crisp Carolina Blue sky.
      I had my headphones on and was listening to Gershwin's "Rhapsody in
      Blue." That was one of those moments that I will never forget: the
      music, the view in front of me, the blue skies above. I sighed and
      walked just a little lighter to my desk.</p>
<p class="docText">Less than two weeks later, that view would be gone forever; even
      the possibility of stumbling across the nexus of that view and that
      music, at the same time in the early morning light&mdash;that possibility
      would be gone, and the only artifact remaining through eternity of that
      experience would be the recording of it that is burned in my
      memory.</p>
<p class="docText">It was 8:30 on the morning of <a name="idx-CHP-25-0774"></a>September 11, 2001. Some of the team was already in the
      office and working on the day's tasks. I was going over a list of
      questions I had on the Nancy project. It was a quiet morning on what I
      thought was going to be a quiet day. I took a short break and checked in
      on Barry Bonds and his quest to break Babe Ruth's home run record. I was
      just about to get my second cup of coffee for the day when all of a
      sudden we all heard a loud explosion. Peter and I walked over to the
      window, and as we looked out, a large plume of fire shot past us,
      followed by smoke and ash. Due to our viewing angle (we were looking out
      east, over the Hudson River) we couldn't see what had caused the
      explosion or the fire shooting past us. We waited a couple of minutes,
      waiting for an announcement from the building staff, but nothing came.
      Alice (a business analyst), Peter, Megan, and I all sat near each other,
      and after a few minutes of discussion, we decided to start walking down
      the stairs in the fire escape, figuring that we would get some direction
      soon. As we entered the fire escape, it seemed that a lot of other
      people had had the same idea. The speed of our descent on the stairs
      slowed, but did not stop as everyone walked down in an orderly fashion.
      Some people had handfuls of tapes, some had tapes and the tape backup
      units as well. Many others were carrying piles of CDs and other personal
      belongings. I was carrying my laptop in my shoulder bag.</p>
<p class="docText">As more and more people entered the fire escape, the going got
      slower and slower. The apprehension around us was made all the more
      eerie by the fact that we still did not know what had happened. Was it a
      <a name="idx-CHP-25-0775"></a>terrorist bomb? Was it some kind of Con Ed situation like
      a manhole cover exploding? Whatever it turned out to be, not one of the
      thousands of people on that staircase would have thought that it was
      caused by an airplane flying into Tower 1, the next tower over. Nor did
      we suspect that a second plane was heading for Tower 2 and was about to
      crash into us.</p>
<p class="docText">The four of us stayed together, helping to
      keep all of our spirits high. After about 45 minutes, we had gotten to
      the 50th floor. We faintly heard an announcement being made in the
      hallway, so everyone emptied the fire exit to hear. The fact that there
      was no PA system in the fire exit must have been a design flaw,
      no?</p>
<p class="docText">The crackling male voice told us to remain calm, but no
      information was given about the cause of the explosion. The voice just
      reassured us to remain calm, that the situation was in Tower 1 and was
      under control, and, here's the kicker, that we should all head back to
      our offices and wait for further instructions.</p>
<p class="docText">Here was a real dilemma. We were all trying to stay organized and
      follow the instruction we were given. Unfortunately, at a gut level,
      this instruction didn't make sense to anybody. So, what to do? Do what
      our gut was telling us to do and get the hell out of there, or do what
      we were being told and go back to our offices? Megan and Peter stepped
      off by themselves to discuss it, which left Alice and me to come up with
      our own decision.</p>
<p class="docText">After going back and forth on what the right course of action
      should be, we finally agreed that we should go downstairs, get a cup of
      coffee, and see what was going on. Alice and I headed back into the fire
      exit, which was now empty as everyone else was still deciding what to
      do. We were actually able to run down the stairs. We ran and ran, and
      then suddenly felt a huge explosion. The stairs started to sway back and
      forth, a good three feet in either direction. I grabbed on to the
      railing, half expecting it to pull out of the wall as the stairs were
      turned into a pendulum. For some reason, I had a vision of Shelley
      Winters in <span class="docEmphasis">The Poseidon Adventure</span>, holding on to a
      steel ladder that just pulled out of the wall when she grabbed it before
      being dumped into the water. But, to my great relief, the stairs in
      Tower 2 held and the swaying eventually stopped. I noticed that we were
      on the 43rd floor. To my amazement, there was absolutely no damage to
      the stairs. The lights were on, the staircase and railings were solid,
      and there was not a chip of paint or plaster anywhere to be seen. Alice
      spoke first and said that we needed to keep going. I agreed and we
      continued to run down the stairs until, once again, other people had
      entered the fire exit and the descent again slowed to a crawl.</p>
<p class="docText">It took us about 45 more minutes to get out of the building. As we
      entered the World Trade Center shopping pavilion, fire department and
      other emergency service personnel were lined up every 5 to 10 feet,
      creating a corridor for us to walk through up and out by Building 5 (or
      was it 7?). They were proud to be doing their job, helping us get out.
      Every day I have prayed that they, too, were able to get out before the
      building collapsed.</p>
<p class="docText">All in all, the company of 200 employees lost four people that
      day. We had all felt like one big family. The beautiful office space
      that the family had struggled to attain, which was a symbol of our
      success and unity, was gone. We were homeless, made that way by a
      tragedy that will never be forgotten. And we had lost four comrades.
      But, like any good team, we pulled together and worked tirelessly to get
      the company back on its feet, to support each other emotionally and
      spiritually and in any way that we could.</p>
<p class="docText">There are many stories of escape from Tower
      2, and I would like to share a few team members' efforts to survive. I
      also want to mention that when the plane hit Tower 2, it had crashed
      right into our conference room on the 78th floor. This conference room
      was the showpiece of the office. The side facing outward was all glass
      and there was an incredible view of the southern tip of Manhattan. It
      was such a special place that our parent company would frequently use
      the conference room when making important presentations. That morning,
      two people from the parent company were there early to set up for a
      presentation later that day. Unfortunately, they did not survive the
      attack.</p>
<p class="docText">Aparna was a member of the QA team. She was eight months pregnant
      on 9/<a name="idx-CHP-25-0776"></a>11. She had decided to stay near her desk when we heard
      the first explosion. When the plane hit Tower 2, the ceiling panels on
      the 77th floor fell, filling the entire space with dust and debris.
      Aparna could not hide under her desk to escape because of her pregnancy.
      All she could do was stand there and get showered with debris. When the
      dust had started to settle, she began to call out for help. Rick, the
      manager of the QA department, and Tony, the manager of data operations,
      both came running. They helped Aparna to the fire exit and the three of
      them walked down the 78 flights of stairs together.</p>
<p class="docText">When they got outside, EMS immediately took Aparna to a local
      hospital to ensure that she and her baby were OK. They were, and one
      month later, Aparna had a healthy baby boy. Rick was covered in dust and
      EMS gave him oxygen. He was sitting on a curb on Church St. with the air
      mask on. All of a sudden, the police started yelling for everybody to
      run as fast as they could. The building had started to collapse. Ripping
      the oxygen mask off, Rick started running for his life. He ran down John
      St. but there was no place to enter as most businesses had closed by
      then. Suddenly, he saw an open bar and grabbed the door handle and
      pulled himself inside. As he closed the door, the rolling cloud of the
      remnants of Tower 2 blew past, leaving Rick safe inside the door.</p>
<p class="docText">Bernie was the director of IT. He had come in that morning and
      gone directly to the conference room on the 78th floor to help the
      visitors prepare for their presentation, making sure the advanced A/V
      system was working. With everything in working order, he accidentally
      left his briefcase on the 78th floor and returned to his office on the
      77th floor where he was when the first plane hit Tower 1. He spent some
      time coordinating with people on his side of the building and was
      getting ready to leave when he realized that he didn't have his
      briefcase with him. He picked up the phone and called Violet, who sat
      next to the conference room.</p>
<p class="docText">"Violet, this is Bernie. I'm looking for my briefcase. Can you
      tell me if it is in the conference room? And, by the way, what are you
      still doing there?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Bernie, yes, your briefcase is in there. I can see it from my
      desk. I am just going to put the phone system on night standby, and then
      I am going to get out of here," Violet replied.</p>
<p class="docText">"OK, thanks," Bernie replied. "I have to call my mother to let her
      know I am OK, and then I will get the briefcase and head on out myself.
      Thanks."</p>
<p class="docText">Bernie quickly spoke with his mother, and as
      he said goodbye to her and hung up the phone, Violet, who was still at
      her desk, saw a dark shadow cover the conference room window and then
      "POW," the second hijacked plane crashed through the window and Violet,
      now frozen in her chair, watched in shock and horror as the plane's wing
      flew right past her, just a few feet from her face. Luckily for Violet,
      she was able to get herself moving and headed right for the exit
      stairs.</p>
<p class="docText">Bernie also headed to an emergency exit. The first one he went to
      was jammed shut. He tried to push it open, but something was blocking
      the door on the other side. He ran down the hall and found another exit.
      He pushed, and this time the door opened easily. However, the stairwell
      entrance was flooded and some kind of liquid was leaking down from the
      ceiling above Bernie's head. He thought it smelled like kerosene and
      assumed that a pipe in the heating system had cracked. He didn't know
      that he was being dowsed in jet fuel.</p>
<p class="docText">Another worker, Anthony, came running into the stairwell, holding
      a flashlight in front of him. Together, he and Bernie ran down the
      stairs. As Bernie grabbed the railing, he noticed it was wet and sticky.
      He assumed that the kerosene was leaking on the railing as well as on
      him. They ran down about thirty floors when, all of a sudden, the lights
      went out. Total darkness. Anthony switched on his flashlight and the
      pair had to slow their pace for another 10 floors until they came to a
      place where the stair lights were working again. In the new light,
      Bernie took a moment to look down at his hands. They were covered in
      blood. The liquid that was on the railing on the upper floors had not
      been the same kerosene that had soaked through Bernie's shirt. It had
      been human blood.</p>
<p class="docText">Bernie and Anthony had made it to the lobby of the WTC and were
      now running out to the street. An EMS worker came right up to Bernie who
      was soaked in blood and jet fuel. Immediately, the EMS worker made
      Bernie take off his shirt. As he was lifting the shirt above his head,
      they heard the police yelling "Run!" Bernie started running, but he
      didn't have as big of a head start as Rick did. Instead of being able to
      find shelter, Bernie just kept running, even as the debris cloud caught
      up with him and coated him the same way it coated Lower
      Manhattan.</p>
<p class="docText">As that <a name="idx-CHP-25-0777"></a>September day went on, I was able to speak with all the
      members of the software development team and confirm that everyone was
      safe, alive, and accounted for. I was also asking for volunteers to go
      to our small Philadelphia satellite office to rebuild all the backend
      data servers that had been in New York and to establish the numerous
      operational procedures that were involved in the nightly push of data to
      our clients.</p>
<p class="docText">Unfortunately, at 12:30 that night, just as I was getting ready
      for bed, my phone rang.</p>
<p class="docText">"Hello, Ned?" the caller said. "I am a friend of Barbara's
      husband. You work with Barbara at Benchmark, right?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Yes, I do," I replied.</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, no one has seen or heard from her since the <a name="idx-CHP-25-0778"></a>attacks this morning. Her husband wants to know if you
      might have seen her since then."</p>
<p class="docText">"No," I whispered helplessly. "I saw her at
      the coffee machine very early in the morning. But our desks were on the
      opposite sides of the building, so I didn't see her after that."</p>
<p class="docText">"OK, thanks," the friend said. "Her husband just wanted to call
      everyone possible."</p>
<p class="docText">I hung up the phone. Barbara was never found and was eventually
      counted as one of the four Benchmark employees who were killed that
      day.</p>
<p class="docText">By the next day, 15 people from Benchmark had arrived at the
      Philly office. This office was home to a small group of software
      developers who were responsible for writing and maintaining the frontend
      application. There was one conference room which was going to be
      repurposed as a data center, and many developers were already sharing
      small cubicles. The office quickly began to look like a small college
      campus during finals week.</p>
<p class="docText">The goal was that by the time the stock market reopened the
      following Monday, our software would be fully operational and we would
      be able to push data down to all of our clients. That meant that there
      was less than a week to get data feeds and servers installed and
      configured and to establish the three-man nightly operations center that
      was required to support the software.</p>
<p class="docText">Curt and Dmitri represented the software group. They worked
      tirelessly over the next week making sure that all of the custom
      software was loaded on the servers and correctly configured. The rest of
      the software team that had stayed in New York were communicating with
      them constantly to help stress-test the data feeds as they became
      operational and to ensure that the customers would be able to use the
      software. Sleeping was rare, and so were hotel rooms. It felt like we
      were working at NASA during a lunar mission! Pizza boxes were stacked
      floor to ceiling in any corner that wasn't occupied by a data server or
      a developer with a laptop.</p>
<p class="docText">By the time the stock market opened the following Monday, our
      software was ready to go, albeit with a few Band-Aids in place. However,
      our clients were happy that at least one of the data providers was
      working.</p>
<p class="docText">Dmitri stayed in Philly for a few extra days to do an inventory of
      our <a name="idx-CHP-25-0779"></a>backup source code servers. We had to make sure that all
      production software could be compiled and run according to
      specification. Dmitri called me at home with utter despair in his voice.
      He told me that while the SourceSafe server that contained all of the
      company's documentation had been backed up nightly, the server that
      contained all the source code had never been added to the nightly
      backups. Oops! No one had bothered to test the integrity of the
      <a name="idx-CHP-25-0780"></a>server backups. All of the software that Dmitri had
      written at Benchmark for the previous seven years was gone.</p>
<p class="docText">We spent a lot of time over the next few weeks trying to figure
      out what source code we did and didn't have. We checked our home
      computers and any laptops that we had with us. Fortunately for Dmitri,
      his last big project had been saved by one of our <a name="idx-CHP-25-0781"></a>process improvement initiatives. We had instituted peer
      reviews between the New York and Philly offices and
      had recently sent the Philly group a large project that Dmitri had
      worked on. The source code was safe on the Philly development manager's
      computer.</p>
<p class="docText">In the end, senior management decided that since so much source
      code was lost, only production software that was in immediate need of an
      upgrade would be reproduced. This allowed most of the software team to
      begin working on new development work. The only question now was where
      we would be <a name="idx-CHP-25-0782"></a>working from.</p>
<p class="docText">A few weeks after 9/<a name="idx-CHP-25-0783"></a>11, the entire company got together at the Union Club in
      New York City for a company meeting. This was the first time we had all
      gotten together after the <a name="idx-CHP-25-0784"></a>attacks. In a way, the Union Club's requirement of formal
      dress helped to create an atmosphere of importance. Dressed in our
      Sunday Best, we came together and together mourned our lost coworkers.
      One of the people who had been killed was George, a salesman with the
      company for many years. I was speaking with one of his fellow salesmen
      who said he had been at the dentist that morning and, as he was sitting
      in the dentist chair, was in utter despair as the TV reports started
      coming in. All he wished for was to be back at the World Trade Center
      with his team. He had spent the previous few weeks feeling guilty about
      not being there. His thinking was that if he had been there, perhaps he
      could have saved his friend. I have heard the same sentiment from many
      people: people who were just getting off the subway, people who were
      still in their cars driving to work but could see the planes as they
      attacked us, people who lived just down the street in Battery Park. It
      seems irrational, but people want to feel connected in whatever way they
      can.</p>
<p class="docText">At the Union Club, Nancy spoke with Curt and me about permanently
      sending the developers to work in the Philly office until a new location
      could be found in New York. She didn't believe that developers could be
      productive working at home and that they needed to be closely
      supervised. Curt told her that the conditions in Philly were extremely
      overcrowded and that he wasn't going to have the developers share hotel
      rooms for an indefinite period of time. He wouldn't give in, and Nancy
      walked away frustrated and angry.</p>
<p class="docText">It turned out to be six months before we were all relocated
      together in our new office space. During this time, everyone worked from
      home but remained highly productive, and we constantly communicated with
      the rest of the company. We IM'd each other, teleconferenced, had
      impromptu meetings in New York City restaurants like America and Zen
      Pallate in Union Square, and did whatever we could to stay productive. I
      even had a three-hour meeting in Starbucks with one of Nancy's
      assistants to try to hash out the requirements for the stalled project.
      It just so happened that the assistant had some downtime. Nancy had told
      her to work on the requirements if it wouldn't interfere with other
      activities. By the time we moved into the new space, the requirements
      were complete, inspected, and approved, and the coding was 50%
      complete.</p>
<p class="docText">At the end of February 2002, we settled into our new office space.
      We had the entire fifth floor of what used to be a dot-com start-up
      company in the West Village. There was a foosball room, a yoga room, and
      lots of curved walls and oddly angled corners. It turned out that there
      had been a bar in Philly that had a foosball table and some of the
      people who had worked there got quite good at it.
      The yoga room was turned into a meeting room but the foosball table
      stayed!</p>
<p class="docText">Another change was in store for us. Curt had made the decision to
      return to Carnegie Mellon to get more involved with CMMI and <a name="idx-CHP-25-0785"></a>process engineering. He resigned and I was given his job.
      We also expanded the team to include two new developers and one
      consultant. The team was changing right before our eyes. But our shared
      experiences of the previous six months had created an invisible bond
      between us that could never be changed. The way we thought about each
      other, the way we worked together, the way we could look at a problem
      and know the solution the other person was thinking of without saying
      it&mdash;no, nobody ever talked about it, but we all felt it and honored
      it.</p>
<p class="docText">One department benefit that I instituted right away was for each
      developer to be able to work from home one day a week. We had proved
      that we could be just as productive from home as in the office. The only
      constraint was that we had to do it on the q.t. because one of the other
      managing directors did not agree with this policy (guess who?).</p>
<p class="docText">The team continued to work hard. Now that we had some unplanned
      time, we took the opportunity to create a strong code foundation. Each
      developer was responsible for writing <a name="idx-CHP-25-0786"></a>reusable code and, for every project he worked on, he had
      to create at least one reusable component. This could be a backend
      processing DLL or a user interface widget. At our weekly department
      meetings, one developer would have to present his contribution to the
      rest of the group. He had to include code samples on how to use his
      contribution as well as showing the group the code he wrote to create
      his object. As a senior developer on the team, it was soon Dmitri's turn
      to make his presentation.</p>
<p class="docText">Dmitri resisted. He came to see me and told me that he wasn't
      comfortable speaking in front of the group. He had a thick Russian
      accent and felt that he couldn't communicate that well and that he would
      ruin the meeting for everyone. I said, "Dmitri, you are always meeting
      with one or two people, showing them how to write code or helping them
      debug a problem. Everyone understands you just fine. Don't worry, these
      are your friends!" We spoke some more and I told him that if he really
      didn't want to do the presentation, he could skip this round. He thought
      about it and eventually agreed to give it a try.</p>
<p class="docText">The day of the presentation came. Dmitri got so tied up with
      making his handouts that he was late to the meeting. We sent out a
      search party and found him at the copy machine, battling the automatic
      collator. The search party helped him clear the paper jam and finish
      making the copies. They all came back together and Dmitri began his
      presentation. He had written a DLL that standardized the format of error
      logs, and the output could be directed to either a text file, the
      Windows Event Logger, or both. This was something that the developers
      really needed and they were anxious to start using Dmitri's DLL. As he
      began writing his sample code to his interface with the DLL on the
      whiteboard, you could tell he was nervous. He spoke with his back to the
      group and his handwriting was hard to read. He stumbled through his
      presentation and, thinking he was finished, sat down, visibly
      perspiring, and asked whether there were any questions. I am not sure
      who started it, but there was a look of utter despair on Dmitri's face
      and we all just started to laugh. Even Dmitri
      started to laugh. And that was enough to get rid of all the tension in
      the room. And the meeting changed from a formal presentation to just
      another session where Dmitri was showing the rest of us how to do
      something that he knew backward and forward. The meeting continued, and
      before we knew it, we had run out of time and the next group was
      knocking on the conference room door to get us out.</p>
<p class="docText">Megan had the same aversion to speaking up in large groups that
      Dmitri had. She was one of the QA testers. She had the dogged
      determination needed to uncover even the most obscure bugs. When she
      walked over to the development area, the programmers took cover.
      Unfortunately, she was not much of a contributor to inspection meetings.
      One day I happened to be sitting next to her at a requirements
      inspection meeting. We all had our copies of the document. When I
      glanced down at Megan's copy, I was impressed that she had red marks on
      just about every paragraph! She had really taken the time to read this,
      I thought. However, she didn't say anything during the meeting. I
      figured that she had her reasons and didn't say anything at the
      time.</p>
<p class="docText">Later that day, I walked over to her desk.</p>
<p class="docText">"Megan, you have a sec?" I asked.</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure. What's up?"</p>
<p class="docText">"I was just curious as to why you didn't bring up any of your
      comments at the meeting this morning."</p>
<p class="docText">I could tell she was getting very uncomfortable with the
      conversation and didn't want to answer me. Since I wasn't her manager, I
      decided to not push the issue with her. But I did speak with her manager
      later on and the two of us began to gently encourage her to be more
      assertive.</p>
<p class="docText">A few months later, I was at another requirements meeting with
      Megan. We were quickly moving through the document when all of a sudden
      Megan raised her hand and said, "Excuse me, I think I found some
      mistakes on the previous page. Does anyone want me to point them out? I
      don't know how important it is. I'm sorry for stopping everyone." We all
      turned back to the previous page and Megan showed us the two mistakes
      she had found. They were two small, non-critical errors, but everyone
      was glad to have them pointed out. "Great catch, Megan," I said. She
      started to apologize for finding them and wasting everyone's time, but I
      quickly stopped her: "No, you were 100% correct to point them out.
      Remember, we are so much better off finding all the defects now rather
      than waiting until development or testing. Good job." Over time, Megan
      became respected as the most thorough document inspector in the QA
      department.</p>
<p class="docText">As the group manager, it was important for me to recognize that
      everyone had different strengths and desires when it came to writing
      code. Mary was excellent at creating user interfaces. Peter was our
      <a name="idx-CHP-25-0787"></a>process person. Together, Peter and I went through all the
      nooks and crannies of the <a name="idx-CHP-25-0788"></a>Rational Unified Process and created what we called the
      Benchmark Unified Process. This project lasted a few months and the end
      result was a complete road map that any developer
      could follow <a name="idx-CHP-25-0789"></a>to ensure that his project followed the software
      development life cycle <a name="idx-CHP-25-0790"></a>process and had all the needed documents and deliverables.
      This became an invaluable part of the department's assets and the core
      for writing quality software. Our adoption and adherence to this process
      and the focusing on each other's strengths, not weaknesses, was the main
      reason why, over the next three years, the software development team had
      a perfect track record of delivering software on time and on budget and
      with the features promised. We were the department that everyone wanted
      to work in and be a part of. I had to keep a list of people who wanted
      to transfer into my department.</p>
<p class="docText">One day, my boss, Bernie, came to see me. "Ned," he said, "I have
      a favor to ask you."</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure," I replied. "Go ahead."</p>
<p class="docText">"There is a guy over in the IT department that has been writing
      little utilities for us in VB script. He's pretty good at it, too. I
      just did his annual review and he is bored working in IT. I think that
      if I don't involve him in more development work, he might leave the
      company."</p>
<p class="docText">"Bernie," I said, "do you realize that I already have official
      requests from five other people to transfer into the development group?
      Are you going to open up six positions for me?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, of course not," said Bernie. "But I don't want to lose
      Doug. Give him a regular interview, and if you think he is a good match
      with the group, I'll work out the transfer myself."</p>
<p class="docText">"How about if I do take Doug, I get to also take one other person
      from the top of the list. You know these are all junior programmers and
      it takes time to train them. We can have them sit with a more senior
      developer for a few months and they'll get some good experience. Plus,
      if it seems that they are not going to be good developers, we will find
      it out soon enough before any real harm is done."</p>
<p class="docText">Bernie said: "I can't make any promises now. See how it goes with
      Doug. If it works out, I'll see what I can do to open another job req.
      OK?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Fair enough," I said. "I'll meet with him and get back to
      you."</p>
<p class="docText">By the end of the month, the development group had two new junior
      programmers, Doug and Henry.</p>
<p class="docText">Although we were successfully adopting and adhering to our process
      and proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that software process does work
      and that the more time spent planning up front guarantees excellent
      results, there were still one or two senior managers who continued to
      fight the process whenever they had a chance. Mary had been working on a
      group of reports for Nancy that "somehow" continued to fly under the
      process radar. One of the outputs on the report was a custom
      calculation. We had no specs on how the calculation was supposed to work
      as Nancy and her staff told Mary to just stop by whenever there was a
      question. But it was a very complex calculation, and the business users
      themselves didn't really understand it. Mary had just delivered her
      third redo of the report and the end users were
      still finding problems with the calculation. Mary came to my office not
      knowing what to do to get consensus on this one calculation.</p>
<p class="docText">I called a meeting with all the stakeholders, including Nancy, her
      staff, Mary, and me. There were about 12 people in the meeting. I stated
      that we had been coding the calculation as we had been told, but it
      seemed that the developers were never told about all of the different
      scenarios that could affect the calculation. As a result, the
      calculation was being asked to do different things under many different
      circumstances. We then asked the business stakeholder to draw out on the
      whiteboard his understanding of the calculation.</p>
<p class="docText">After 20 minutes, we had a whiteboard filled with flows. Everyone
      participated, and there was finally consensus among the group. Yes, they
      were all ready to sign off on this change. That is, until another
      stakeholder asked about a condition that was not represented on the
      whiteboard. Everyone gasped as they realized they had forgotten one
      specific condition that would affect the calculation about 15% of the
      time. We then worked that into the whiteboard flow. Again, everyone
      agreed with the change and was ready to sign off on it. Then, the main
      business stakeholder, Nancy, who was the most senior person in that
      meeting and the one who had always resisted process and process
      improvement, came up with a user workflow that would again totally
      change how the calculation worked in 50% of the cases! Everyone else had
      missed it. We added that to the flow on the whiteboard and thought that
      we finally had the calculation defined.</p>
<p class="docText">Mary's head was spinning, but she did her best to do one final
      walkthrough with the group. When she was finished, Nancy looked at her,
      stood up, and said to the group, "I guess this is why process is so
      important. We should have done this work when the project was starting
      and I apologize to the group for skimping on the requirements for this.
      Let me take this back to the business unit for a few days, get a
      business analyst assigned, and we will then write up a document of
      exactly what we want. There is no need to spend any more time coding
      until we do our work."</p>
<p class="docText">I nearly fell off my chair! This was a huge victory. Curt and
      Nancy used to argue all the time about the need for process, and I knew
      that this statement from Nancy was a moral victory for Curt, who had
      left the company by this point. Having Nancy onboard with process was
      also a moral victory for the entire software development team.</p>
<p class="docText">As we walked out of the conference room, Nancy waited for me
      outside the door. While we were walking to our offices, she said to me,
      "Ned, it has come to my attention that you allow your group to work from
      home one day a week. Even on Fridays." Oh no, I thought. There goes
      that! I started to mumble something, but didn't know what to say.</p>
<p class="docText">"Don't worry," Nancy continued, "I just ask that you keep it among
      yourselves and don't let the other departments know what you are doing.
      I see that it works well in your group, but it would never work in
      mine."</p>
<p class="docText">"Sure," I said, "no problem. See you later."</p>
<p class="docText">I went into my office and sat down at my desk with a wide grin on
      my face.</p>
