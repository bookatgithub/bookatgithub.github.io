<p class="docText">The infrastructure I set up for the translators was basically an
        extension of what I had used myself to write the book: a collection of
        XML <a name="idx-CHP-21-0692"></a>master files stored in a Subversion repository, written
        to the DocBook DTD, and converted to output formats using a collection
        of command-line programs driven by some Makefiles.</p>
<p class="docText">Let me try saying that in English:</p>
<p class="docText">I wrote the book in a format (XML) that, while a bit awkward to
        work in, is very easy to produce web pages and printable books from.
        For example, here's what the beginning of <a class="docLink" href="building_video_games.html#building_video_games">Chapter 3</a> looks like in the original
        XML:</p>
<pre>
&lt;chapter id="technical-infrastructure"&gt;

&lt;title&gt;<a name="idx-CHP-21-0693"></a>Technical Infrastructure&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;para&gt;Free software projects rely on technologies that support the
selective capture and integration of information.  The more skilled
you are at using these technologies, and at persuading others to use
them, the more successful your project will be.  This only becomes
more true as the project grows.  Good information management is what
prevents open source projects from collapsing under the weight of
Brooks' Law&lt;footnote&gt;, &lt;para&gt;From his book &lt;citetitle&gt;The Mythical Man
Month&lt;/citetitle&gt;, 1975.  See &lt;ulink

which states that adding manpower to a late software project makes it
later.  Fred Brooks observed that the complexity of a project
increases as the &lt;emphasis&gt;square&lt;/emphasis&gt; of the number of ...

<p class="docText">Here is what that becomes after being run through the converter
        to produce web output:</p>

          of &#8230; .</p>

<p class="docText">One can certainly see the similarity between the two texts, but
        there's no doubt that the XML master files are harder to read. For me,
        that was OK: the inconvenience of working in XML was outweighed by the
        ability to produce different types of output conveniently.</p>
<p class="docText">I managed the collection of XML files using a version control
        system called Subversion, which is very familiar to programmers, but
        less widely known outside the programming community. Similarly, the
        converters&mdash;one for web output and another for printed output&mdash;were
        powerful and flexible <a name="idx-CHP-21-0694"></a>tools, but somewhat hard to use, especially for
        non-programmers. Just to set them up you must first have various other
        supporting programs installed on your computer. The overall process is
        difficult under any circumstances, but it's a bit less difficult if
        your computer runs on a Unix-like operating system (again, common
        among programmers, but not other demographics), and a bit more
        difficult on Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p class="docText">All of this was fine when I was the only author. I'm a
        programmer anyway, I was somewhat familiar <a name="idx-CHP-21-0695"></a>with all those tools already, and since I was putting in
        a lot of effort to write the book in the first place, adding a little
        extra overhead to learn some tools was well worth it. I knew it would
        pay off in the long run, and it did&mdash;for me.</p>
<p class="docText">But the situation for the volunteer translators was completely
        different. They were <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> all programmers, most
        had no prior experience with these tools, and they therefore faced a
        steep learning curve right at the start (always the worst place to
        face a steep learning curve!). Furthermore, since any given <a name="idx-CHP-21-0696"></a>translation was being done by several translators, for
        each individual the ratio of tool-learning to real work was worse than
        it had been for me: each translator paid the same tool-learning cost I
        paid, but each translator was not writing an entire book, and
        therefore had less benefit across which to amortize that cost. The
        translators showed up with one particular kind of expertise&mdash;the
        ability and desire to take English text and rewrite it in another
        language&mdash;and found themselves asked instead to take on a task
        completely unrelated to that expertise: that of learning a whole new
        set of tools, <a name="idx-CHP-21-0697"></a>tools that they might or might not use elsewhere in
        their lives.</p>
<p class="docText">The wonder is not that some of them rebelled, but rather that we
        got any useful translations at all. We did get some: as of this
        writing, the German translation is draft-complete, the Japanese is
        about 80% done, the Spanish about 60%, and so forth. (The French are a
        more interesting case; we'll get to them in a moment.) But seeing what
        the translators had to go through to get this far makes me wonder how
        much <span class="docEmphasis">more</span> could have been done if I hadn't
        imposed such a high tool overhead on the process. Take a look at the
        translator guidelines I wrote up at <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href=""></a> to
        get a sense of how much engineering was required of the participants.
        (I'd just show those guidelines here, but they'd take up too much
        room, which already tells you something.)</p>
