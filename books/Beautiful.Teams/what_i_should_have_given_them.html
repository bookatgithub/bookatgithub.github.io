<p class="docText">Unfortunately, for a long time I didn't realize how punishing
        the aforementioned system was. I knew it was less than ideal, but it's
        very hard to tell why any particular translator isn't doing as much
        work as he said he would&mdash;and it's impossible to notice when a

Hi Karl,

Just to keep you in touch, Etienne and myself moved to the Framalang 
wiki to finish the book <a name="idx-CHP-21-0698"></a>translation. We plan to port all its content to 
docbook format once done (it's about 90% done now).

I think it could be a good idea to link the French translation from 
http://www.producingoss.com/fr/ to 
http://www.framalang.org/wiki/Producing_Open_Source_Software so people 
can benefit from the almost-done translation right now, and it could 
bring new translators.

What do you think?

Cheers,

Bertrand

<p class="docText">In other words, the French translators decided to
        <span class="docEmphasis">route around</span> the technical infrastructure
        <a name="idx-CHP-21-0699"></a>that I had set up to help them translate the book.
        Instead, they copied all the English data over to a wiki, where they
        could do their editing in a convenient, familiar environment. When
        they're done, <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#CHP-21-FNOTE-13">[]</a></sup> they plan to port the translation back to XML.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="CHP-21-FNOTE-13">[]</a></sup> In fact, they finished their first draft of the translation
            while I was writing this chapter.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">That's a pretty searing indictment of my infrastructure, I'd
        say. And looking at the <a name="idx-CHP-21-0700"></a>Framalang wiki site (<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.framalang.org/wiki/Producing_Open_Source_Software"></a>),
        I can't really blame them. It is much more suited to the task of
        coordinating translators than the ad hoc system I'd set up. At
        Framalang, the original text and translation are displayed next to
        each other, in different colors. There are special functions for
        tracking who is responsible for what portions, for giving feedback,
        for providing a centralized list of agreed-on translations for common
        terms, for labeling what work remains to be done, and so on. All of
        these things can be accomplished in my ad hoc system, too, of course,
        but the difference is that they aren't handed to the translators for
        free: the team is forced to reinvent the wheel over and over, whereas
        Framalang just gives out the keys to the car (see the figure on <a class="docLink" href="conclusion-id001.html#conclusion-id001">Section 21.9</a>).</p>
<p class="docText">Bertrand's announcement prompted another translator to voice
        some dissatisfaction with the homegrown infrastructure:</p>

Bonjour mon amis,

on a different note, maybe you would like to share you're experience
with the wiki format vs. subversion. How much participation have you
received apart from the main translators. How many translators joined
your effort, quality of their work etc.
Something I especially miss with the current format, are reader
statistics and feedback.

ciao,
Manuel

<p class="docText">Seeing this on-list correspondence made me think back to private
        conversations I'd had with some of the other translators. Many of them
        had had <a name="idx-CHP-21-0701"></a>problems working in XML. Even though the translators
        themselves generally understood the format well enough to work with
        it, their editing <a name="idx-CHP-21-0702"></a>tools often did not. Their word processors (particularly
        on Microsoft Windows) would sometimes mess up the XML. This was
        something I'd never experienced myself, but that's only to be
        expected: I'd chosen the format in the first place, so naturally it
        worked well with <span class="docEmphasis">my</span> <a name="idx-CHP-21-0703"></a>tools.<a name="idx-CHP-21-0704"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Looking back, I can correlate the conversations I had with
        frustrated individual translators with dropoffs in their
        contributions; a few of them actually stopped doing translation
        altogether. Of course, some turnover is to be expected in any
        volunteer group, but the important thing is to notice when dropoffs
        happen for a specific reason. In this case, they were, but because I
        was personally comfortable with the tools, it didn't occur to me for a
        long time that they were a significant gumption sink for others. The
        result is that I effectively turned down an unknown amount of
        volunteer energy: many of the translations that were started have
        still not been finished, and some of the responsibility for that has
        to lie with the awkward tool requirements I imposed.</p>
