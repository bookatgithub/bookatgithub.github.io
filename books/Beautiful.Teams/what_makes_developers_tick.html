<p class="docText">We wanted to know what makes <a name="idx-CHP-5-0083"></a>developers tick, and all signs pointed to Andy Lester.
        He's an expert in hiring smart people and building teams that work,
        and he's done a lot of writing and speaking about the topic. And, as a
        member of the Perl development team, he knows what it takes to build
        great software. We talked to him to get some insight into what
        motivates&mdash;and demotivates!&mdash;the people who build software, and how to
        help them work well together.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What makes you know about
      teams, how software teams work</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: I've been programming for
      21, 22 years professionally, on some good teams and some bad teams.
      First off, I program for fun. I'm able to do for a living and make good
      money in what I love to do anyway. If I'm not having fun doing this,
      it's not worthwhile. And part of that fun comes from people I'm working
      with. Yes, it's fun to work alone, but the <a name="idx-CHP-5-0084"></a>social aspect&mdash;both at work and on open source projects&mdash;is
      undeniable. The open source world has social aspects as part of the
      whole thing, because otherwise, you're just writing for yourself.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think that's a big part of getting a team
      to work better? That need for social fulfillment is happening with
      everybody on the team, and not just some people</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: That's hard to tell. You
      go back to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and social is one of those
      things that's pretty low on the pyramid, meaning more basic. But what
      social means to some people is very different from what social means to
      others.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Are you saying that in order to have a good team,
      you need to go out for pizza twice a week? What do you mean by
      "social"</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: For some people, their
      "social" is sort of separate from the work to be done. So yes, it could
      be that we all hang out and have pizza, or we all go to lunch together.
      For some people, the social aspect is absolutely integrated into the
      work&mdash;"I want to work with other people." Some people want to throw on
      their headphones&mdash;"Don't bother me for the next four hours." Neither of
      those is right or wrong, they both just are.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, you have to be sensitive to how the people
      on your team work, and help give them an environment they feel is the
      most interesting, most fun social environment you can give
      them</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Yes. And people coming
      into an environment need to be aware of what the existing team dynamic
      is. If I, Andy, have someone come to me and say, "Hey, I've got a
      problem figuring out what's wrong with this function here," I'm glad to
      help out, whereas other people may see that as a gross intrusion on
      their programming time. I see helping other people as much a part of my
      job as actually writing my own code. Not everyone sees it that
      way.</p>
<p class="docText">And it's tough, because we're so set in our ways that the initial
      reaction when those kinds of conflicts come up is to think that the
      other person is wrong. "Why are you bothering me? You are wrong to be
      bothering me." So, I could see somebody else who's struggling on code as
      wrong to not avail himself of the human resources around him, and say,
      "Yeah, I could help you out on that." And understanding the dynamic
      you're getting into and already are in takes a lot of self-awareness and
      observing of the world around you.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: How did you learn that? Did you learn that
      through experiment? Did you have a bad experience</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: I've certainly joined
      teams where I, the gregarious Andy who sees that sort of interaction as
      the way life should be, the way I prefer it, where that's not the case.
      Where interrupting the flow is seen as a cardinal
      sin. It didn't go well. There was constant conflict because of it, and
      that was very frustrating to me because I felt alone and isolated, and
      I'm sure the other people felt that I was a pain in the ass.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: OK, but what about other people who, once they
      know that they can get help from people around them, tend to lean on
      other people all the time? People who run into the first roadblock and,
      rather than Google for the answer, tap someone on the shoulder every
      time</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Well, the way you phrase
      that tips your hand as to how you see that.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Well, I'm asking, is it possible that it's
      negative</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: It could be negative. It
      all depends on what the <a name="idx-CHP-5-0085"></a>social norms are. One thing that geeks are terrible at is
      social norms. And I don't just mean social norms of society&mdash;"Hey, look,
      bathe every day"&mdash;and I use that both humorously and with all
      seriousness.</p>
<p class="docText">What I'm talking about is social norms of any given group. And
      that can be really tough, because you have to have awareness of those
      around you. That lack of awareness can be debilitating, and actually I
      do have a story from yesterday, when we were having a code review. Three
      of us in the group were well seasoned with doing code reviews. The
      fourth guy, who was actually having the code reviewed, was less
      comfortable with them. We went in and were talking about the code,
      discussing it and so on, and as we kept going the guy getting the code
      reviewed was getting more and more uncomfortable with the things we were
      pointing out. And one of the other guys was becoming more and more
      animated, and more and more interested in explaining his point of view,
      and became oblivious to what the guy having his code reviewed was
      looking like. I was watching the reviewee, who was getting upset and
      frustrated at how things were going. The other two weren't paying any
      attention, they were pretty much just talking to each other, and that
      lack of awareness could have been really ugly. I saw what was going on,
      and said, "You know, guys, we've been at this for a while. Let's take a
      break." Just to let the pressure off.</p>
<p class="docText">Geeks&mdash;and I include myself in here&mdash;do not by nature gauge their
      audience well. And their audience is really anyone within earshot. In
      this case, there were four of us at the table, and all of a sudden it
      became a two-person conversation and there was no awareness of the other
      people in the room. If I hadn't stopped that, I think there would have
      been some real hostility popping up.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, I'm the sort of geek you're talking
      about</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: God bless you.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: And it's taken me a long time to realize this
      and change the way I interact with people. One of the things I'm in the
      habit of doing&mdash;and it was a lot worse when I was younger&mdash;is that when
      I've got a point, I'll be overly pedantic about it and argue it to
      completion, whether or not the other person is interested in arguing. It
      took me a long time to learn that I shouldn't make overly broad
      generalizations, and then let the</span> <span class="docEmphasis">argument
      sort out the actual issue, because normal, non-geek people tend to find
      that extraordinarily irritating</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Now, I've had many geek friends over the years, many
      who've had similar problems and don't recognize it. In fact, they'd
      probably be surprised to find out that making generalizations and
      arguing them out is even a problem, and not the preferable way to
      interact with other people. What do you do when you've got somebody like
      that on your team? How do you help them? Or do you help them at all? Do
      you try to change the environment to suit them better</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: A lot of it depends on
      what your relationship is with the offending person. For many geeks,
      "conforming"&mdash;that dirty word&mdash;could be seen as not only unnecessary but a
      sign of weakness. A lot of geeks pride themselves on being different.
      Difference is braggable. And that's great on its own I guess, if you
      want to be different. But if it hurts the team, then it's not.</p>
<p class="docText">Either people get it or they don't. Helping those who don't get it
      can be difficult, because that intrinsic need that all humans have to be
      understood, respected, and listened to, may be seen as a weakness by the
      geeks. That's a really tough battle.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: We're talking like it's just accepted that
      there's a certain kind of person who's in software. Is that
      true</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: No, of course not. Not
      everybody is <a name="idx-CHP-5-0086"></a>socially inept.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: Right</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: But there is a
      not-insignificant percentage of people who are, who have grown up
      dealing with computers&mdash;preferring to deal with computers&mdash;because the
      computer does what you want, it deals with you exactly, logically. I
      don't have to worry about how the computer feels. I can get mad and
      curse at the computer, and the computer will not be upset at me for
      that. There are no annoying emotions to have to deal with, and dealing
      with other people's emotions can be annoying. Ask anybody who's been
      married or has had a long-term relationship. Yeah, it can be annoying.
      But it's what needs to happen if you're going to deal with other
      people.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: So how does this all come together? I'm
      interested in a couple of facets of what you just talked about. One is
      how people react to criticism in general. When you were talking about
      the code review example, it seemed like part of that was about people
      being aware of one another. But another part of it is that in a team
      environment, you have to put yourself out there: put your code out
      there, put your work out there, and allow other people to react to it,
      take that reaction and do something with it</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-5-0087"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: And one of the things is
      that you'll have somebody, for instance, who's able to separate
      himself&mdash;and I say "him" because it's overwhelmingly male&mdash;who will be
      able to logically separate himself from his code, his work. Somebody
      comes along and says, "Gee, you know, this code totally sucks here
      because you're doing blah, blah, blah." He's going to logically stand
      back and say, "OK, I never thought about it that way, I'll do it that
      way." Whereas other geeks or, more likely, normal people, will not
      understand, will take that as an attack, take that
      as an insult. "You did that wrong" is effectively what the person is
      saying. And that can be very harsh on the other person.</p>
<p class="docText">The computer guy will come around and see somebody in another
      department, for instance, and say, "You're doing your spreadsheet wrong,
      you should be doing blah, blah, blah." And he is working strictly on a
      logical point of view: "This work product could be better if this
      changed." Whereas the person whose work product it is that's not done
      according to the <a name="idx-CHP-5-0088"></a>geek's standard sees it as an attack on the work that he's
      been doing, and that is something that's very difficult to understand.
      It's even more difficult to understand when it's a fellow geek who feels
      like that. That's the really surprising part. Because even if they
      learn, "OK, I don't go over to the people in accounting and criticize
      their spreadsheets because they do 'em wrong," they can understand that.
      But when it's another programmer? That's baffling! "Why does this person
      feel like that? That's crazy!" And not only that, because that would be
      almost empathetic, but, "Why are they so sensitive?"</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, how do you help a non-geek understand this?
      And how do you help a geek come around? How do you help them interact?
      It seems like we've got potential communication problems on both sides
      that really require a lot of understanding</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Number one, the geek has
      to understand that there is benefit to respecting others.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: It sounds so simple when you say it like
      that</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: It is! It's funny because
      there just was a panel at OSCON with Kirrily Robert&mdash;she runs a website
      called <a name="idx-CHP-5-0089"></a><a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://GeekEtiquette.com/">GeekEtiquette.com</a>&mdash;so Kirrily and
      I were both on this panel. Her section was an intro to etiquette, and
      why etiquette isn't about salad forks and how you do your wedding
      invitations. It's simply greasing the wheels of human
      interaction.</p>
<p class="docText">She said, using the 80-20 rule, the three things you have to
      remember about etiquette are respect other people, listen to what they
      say, and take a shower every day. If you can do that, that's your 80%.
      And the reason is that if you don't do that, people will not want to
      work with you or interact with you.</p>
<p class="docText">And the thing is, it's not that tough. Her whole point is that a
      term like <span class="docEmphasis">etiquette</span> is a challenge, per se&mdash;yes,
      sometimes it takes work to actually listen to what people are saying
      when they're annoying you. Because, yes, it can be annoying to have to
      listen to what other people say for the sake of respecting them.</p>
<p class="docText">The key is that the geek has to understand that there is value in
      respecting other people, and those social interactions are necessary.
      Because sometimes, it's a matter of "if you're a jerk, you're getting
      fired." You have to understand that if you want to do the things you
      want to do, that requires help from other people, and the only way
      that's going to happen is by being a person that people want to work
      with, want to do things with. And then, once you're there, then you can
      internalize the idea that while you may not take it as an insult to have
      somebody pick on your spreadsheet, many other people do. Many other
      people are not like you. And the differences between us can be so vast,
      between Bob over in accounting and the geek, the differences can be so
      vast such that you have to stand back and say, "Wow, how
      can anybody think like that?" Well, you don't have to understand how or
      why. Just accept it and work with it. And <a name="idx-CHP-5-0090"></a>respect that that's the way the person is.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Wow. That's great advice. I wish I'd heard that
      a lot earlier in my life. But what about Bob in accounting? What's life
      like from his end, dealing with the geek? Can that have an impact on a
      team</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Bob in accounting has a
      tougher job, because Bob is more normal (and I mean statistically
      normal). You might have 100 people in the company, and only five of them
      are geeks, or jerks, or whatever. And he is going to feel very justified
      in feeling offended, because the social norm around him is, "Yes, that's
      the way the geeks are, and you just have to kind of put up with it." But
      Bob would do well to also respect that the geek's way of looking at the
      world is also OK. The way he looks at it is that he's just trying to
      improve things for the sake of improving them, because that is what he
      does. He wants to improve technical things around him for the betterment
      of the person. Bob needs to understand that as well. He may not feel
      that way; he may not feel like the geek is trying to improve things, but
      rather tear him down. But Bob should know that that's all the geek has
      in his heart. Really, the geek just wants things to be better
      technically.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Let's take it a step back. Now, it's not just
      one-on-one, Bob and the geek. Let's take it to software teams. Now you
      need to build up your team. Let's say you're on a team, and you need to
      help the rest of them. You start recognizing that you've got this
      problem. You could be the person in charge of the team, or you could
      just be someone who's an intrepid team member who realizes, "Wow, this
      really affects me and everyone around me." What's the next step? What do
      you do? How do you use this knowledge to help make your software
      better</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Well, you're not going to
      make the software better, per se, but you're certainly going to build it
      faster. Because short of a server catching fire, there's nothing more
      damaging to productivity than having people hate each other, or not
      being able to work together, or having to go to a manager and saying,
      "Look, I need you to sort this out." As a manager, I dread that. It is
      the biggest time-suck in terms of the amount of effort I have to put
      into it.</p>
<p class="docText">I can deal with a server problem, and it's done. But if I've got
      people who are pissed off at each other, I may solve the problem that
      day, but it's not going to go away for a while. So certainly, it's in my
      best interest as the team leader or manager to not let that stuff
      happen. If there's any potential conflict between people, it needs to be
      dealt with right away.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: How much do you think conflict influences how
      your team behaves? By and large, how has conflict been an issue for you
      in the past in building software? Do you feel like that happens all the
      time, that two people on the team start to dislike each other and you
      end up having to have an intervention</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-5-0091"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: One big difference
      between Bob in accounting and the geek is how respect is seen. Society
      says that by default, you give a minimal amount of respect to everyone.
      It's ascribed. You say, "Hey, there's a person here, and I'm not going
      to be a jerk to this person because it's just
      another person." To the geek, respect must be earned. And the lack of
      respect&mdash;if somebody does something stupid, in many geeks' minds that is
      worthy of disrespect.</p>
<p class="docText">I was on a team once where I said, "At the very least, can we just
      have minimal <a name="idx-CHP-5-0092"></a>respect for everyone here?" And I was asked quite
      seriously by someone else, "Well, what if not everybody on this team is
      worthy of respect?" And that's baffling to me as a human, but it's also
      not uncommon. And that minimal amount of respect is something that many
      just don't get.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: It makes us sound like a really angry
      bunch</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Many people can
      be.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: But it also gives a kind of "secret back door"
      for a geek who wants to improve a working relationship with somebody. If
      he needs to work with Bob in accounting, and he knows that his paycheck
      depends on being able to work with Bob in accounting, show Bob a little
      respect&mdash;even if he hasn't earned it yet. Then, he'll reciprocate and
      become a little easier to work with</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Yes. And the lack of
      respect&mdash;well, look at online culture. Why do you have flame wars?
      Because the person on the other end doesn't need my basic respect. I'm
      able to say the most disrespectful things, because the person on the
      other end (if you even think that far) is an actual person reading your
      words who is not worthy of your respect. That doesn't even have to be a
      conscious decision&mdash;"I'm not respecting this person." Respect doesn't
      even enter into it. The geek won't even think that far ahead.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So, let's say you're a team member, and you have
      to get your work done. You're reading this interview and you think,
      "Wow, that's me. That's everyone I work with. We are having trouble with
      Bob in accounting." What's an easy first step</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Here's the thing. We're
      talking about behavior here. If I have a problem with Joe on my team and
      he doesn't respect me, that's not a problem. The problem is the behavior
      behind it. If Joe is aggressive, antagonistic, that's the problem. You
      need to say, "Look, Joe. You and I need to work on this project, and for
      that to happen I need X, Y, and Z to happen. I need to be able to have a
      code review without hearing insults about my code." And everything is I,
      I, I&mdash;this is what I need. Not "Joe, you're a jerk because you're
      insulting my code and you don't respect me." You cannot make Joe respect
      you.</p>
<p class="docText">And if you point the blame at somebody and say, "You are doing
      this, you are doing that," now you're opening yourself up for argument.
      If you say, "Joe, you're disrespecting me"&mdash;"No, I'm not!" And you can
      have an argument all day, and sometimes that's exactly what happens,
      about whether Joe is disrespecting you or not.</p>
<p class="docText">But what you can say instead is, "This is what I need. I need to
      have all discussion to be related to the code at hand. This is my base
      behavior." Because behavior you can't argue about. You can argue about
      attitudes or feelings or intentions. And if there's one thing about
      geeks that we know is that they love to argue, they love to debate. You
      don't want to fall into that trap of opening it up
      <a name="idx-CHP-5-0093"></a>for debate about whether Joe is being a jerk, <a name="idx-CHP-5-0094"></a>disrespecting, etc. Anytime you're talking about that, you
      have to keep it strictly on the behavioral level.</p>
<p class="docText">The other thing is that this is something <a name="idx-CHP-5-0095"></a>for your manager to deal with, or at least be made aware
      of. Really, your manager's job is to remove impediments to your work. If
      Joe is being antagonistic and disrespectful to you or anyone else on the
      team, that's an impediment to the work. What you're really doing is
      you're saying that this is an impediment to work, just as much as if my
      machine crashed and I didn't get any work done today. Both of them are
      detrimental to the productivity of the team.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, if your boss doesn't understand that, if your boss is
      somebody who does not understand these sorts of team dynamics, that is
      probably a doomed team and you'd probably do best to go somewhere
      else.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: I want to take it up a step from geek etiquette
      and teams and talk more on a macro level about managing teams and
      working with people on teams</span>.<a name="idx-CHP-5-0096"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Number one, you as a team
      leader or manager have to understand that the team has to work together.
      Those people problems are your number one potential impediment, and
      anything that gets in the way of people working together is going to
      crush your project. You have to understand that you may have people on
      your team who are a net negative as far as productivity goes. If you
      have somebody who cranks out 100 lines of code a day but drags everyone
      else's productivity down, whether that's because nobody wants to work
      with them, whether that's because time that was previously spent coding
      is now time spent wasted in meetings trying to get everyone to get
      along, you have to understand that from a managerial point of
      view.</p>
<p class="docText">Given that, you have to realize that the people who are disrupting
      the team need to modify their behavior immediately. Otherwise, the
      project will go down the toilet. And if that person cannot understand
      that the team dynamic is more important than any individual
      contribution, then that person is the wrong person for your team and you
      need to help them out. And I mean, help them out of the team, out of the
      company, whatever it may be.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What about when you're putting the team
      together? How do you avoid that in the first place</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: If you're talking about
      <a name="idx-CHP-5-0097"></a>hiring people to join your team, then you need to hire
      specifically for that. Typically, what I've done is that when I hire
      someone, I have at least two rounds of interviews. The first one is
      merely getting past me, and basic technical chops. Can you write code?
      What's your level of technical understanding of programming language X?
      Do you understand database theory? Whatever it may be. That's not tough.
      And it's not very time-consuming, either, because it's just me and that
      person. If that person passes that initial bar of "Can they write code?
      Can they do the work?", the second part is "Can they do the work with
      the team, and will they be a fit with the team?"</p>
<p class="docText">I say "fit" very specifically because every
      team is different. Every department is different, every organization is
      different. And as with <a name="idx-CHP-5-0098"></a>anything else on these interpersonal issues, it's not a
      matter of right and wrong. There's nothing wrong with being the kind of
      guy who wants to go be in his cube and not talk to anybody <a name="idx-CHP-5-0099"></a>for eight hours a day. There's nothing wrong with that,
      except that you are wrong for my team. If you want to work here, that's
      a bad choice. It's a bad choice for that person to work with a team that
      I'm on, because that's not the way my teams run.</p>
<p class="docText">So, the second and sometimes third round of interviews is
      basically getting the rest of the team together and talking to the
      person. Technical issues will come up. But mostly, I'll sit back and
      watch the interactions with others, and see the kinds of things that
      they talk about. The rest of the team will ask things. Usually it'll be
      guided by senior <a name="idx-CHP-5-0100"></a>developers. They'll come in and talk to the person and see
      how they expect to fit in with the team. That's when you talk about
      things like conflicts. "Tell me a story about a conflict you had with
      someone else on your group, when you thought the other person was pretty
      much full of crap. How did you deal with that?" Or, "Tell me about a
      time when you felt you were treated unfairly by someone on your team."
      "Tell me about a time when you've had somebody difficult on a team, and
      how you worked with that."</p>
<p class="docText">That's not the whole of the interview, but it's a big part of it.
      Just hearing a few of those stories&mdash;and it needs to be stories, not just
      "Do you get along with others on your team?" "Of course I do,"
      everybody's going to say that&mdash;given that, you can really get a feel for
      what the person's going to be like in your group.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So that second interview is not just with you,
      but with your team members, too</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-5-0101"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Yes, that second
      interview is usually with the senior team members, and me, and maybe
      even my boss. There will be technical things discussed, but the real
      meat of what we're getting at is the interaction. What I tell people is
      that I'm really picky. I have one open position here, and I'm going to
      be really picky about who gets that position, because I love this team,
      I love the work I'm doing, and I'm not going to let just anyone join my
      group. And there are also, of course, more practical aspects to that.
      Number one, it's really a pain to fire someone.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What about pitfalls for this approach? Does
      everybody get a veto? What if everybody likes the person, except one
      guy</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: It's absolutely not a
      vote. It's certainly not a binary vote. It's "Tell me what you think."
      I'll ask, "Around the table, show me your thumb." But it's certainly not
      binary. And the fortunate thing is that I've never had that case, where
      it was clear that one person was out of alignment with what other people
      thought. I've never had a case where one person was saying, "Yeah, this
      guy's really great and we need to hire him," and everyone else thought
      he was a jerk, or vice versa. Because I find that when you talk long
      enough with people, it's pretty clear whether the person's a good fit or
      not.</p>
<p class="docText">And again, it's fit. "Are they going to really
      fit in with the rest of the team?" Now, the other pitfall that I do
      definitely worry about is that I don't want the team to become a
      monoculture. I don't want it to be where we only hire people who are
      just like us, because then you only get people that are just like you,
      and you don't get a lot of innovation. I try to look <a name="idx-CHP-5-0102"></a>for innovation in other areas.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jenny: When you use words like</span> fit
      <span class="docEmphasis">and</span> personality, <span class="docEmphasis">do people ever gravitate
      toward hiring someone they want to be friends with or hang out with,
      more than really putting them through the paces to see if they're
      actually qualified? What does that do to the culture of the team? Do you
      find that it affects the culture</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-5-0103"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: I haven't found that, not
      that anybody would tell me that. Nobody would say, "I want to hire this
      guy because I think he'd be fun to go drink with." We have enough
      differences in what the team is about that not everybody's alike, so I'm
      not too worried about that. I think that everybody on the team who comes
      into the interview understands the importance of hiring someone they
      have to deal with every day. We're hiring someone who you'll spend more
      waking hours with than your spouse.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: Do you think that a good team should necessarily
      be made up of people who like hanging out together after
      work</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: No, definitely not! I
      don't think that's a requirement at all. I've been on teams where there
      are people that I couldn't imagine going and hanging out with because
      they're just not interesting to me in that way. Maybe they love to play
      beach volleyball, and I have no interest in that. We've got one guy here
      who goes and plays golf a couple of times a week as soon as work is
      over. Well, that's incredibly boring to me. But that's OK. By the same
      token, not everybody works on <a name="idx-CHP-5-0104"></a>open source projects like I do. Not everybody plays guitar
      in a traditional Irish band, like Mike does; whatever it may be.
      Everybody has outside interests, and that's OK&mdash;they don't have to be the
      same. As long as we can get together for those eight to <span class="docEmphStrong">n</span> hours a day and get stuff done.</p>
<p class="docText">Now that being said, sure, some people I do hang out with. And
      that's just natural. But it's not a failure if not everybody wants to go
      do it.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: So what about your open source projects? How
      does all of this apply to them</span>?<a name="idx-CHP-5-0105"></a></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: The dynamics of people
      having to get along together on an open source project are much the same
      as the ones of trying to get along in a company. The difference is that
      on an open source project, there's nobody who can say, "Shape up and fly
      right or you're out on your ear."</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Andrew: What do you think that does to the dynamic, that
      there's no one person on an open source team who can say that? Does that
      help or hinder</span>?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Andy</span>: Well, one of the things
      that's different on an open source project is that the leaders become
      leaders. Look at Perl, which I'm very involved in. Yes, Larry Wall is
      the leader of Perl, because it's his language, he wrote it and invented
      it. But aside from him, all other leadership has
      simply come from things that people have done. If you work on such and
      such, this part and that part, and you write these modules, and
      everybody likes your modules, and you help people out, well, then, you
      naturally are given respect and are seen as a leader. As opposed to
      "Larry has appointed so-and-so to be the boss of this group."</p>
<p class="docText">I think that really matches a lot of the geek tendency toward
      meritocracy, that the people who do the most and best work get the
      rewards. And if that reward is that the person is seen as a respected
      member of the community, then the two naturally go hand in hand.</p>
