<h3 id="title-IDASFLVC" class="docSection1Title">27.15. What to Do Next</h3>
<p class="docText">I was in a bit of a <a name="idx-CHP-27-0863"></a>quandary about what to do next. I wasn't going to tell
        the team to stop unit-testing and doing code reviews&mdash;I felt as if
        those two activities were going to save us. But I did want to be able
        to keep my job. And I didn't want to lose more time on the project. I
        decided to talk to Dan now. Dan was the laid-back type. He thought
        before he spoke, and not much ever seemed to faze him. Aside from
        being an original developer on the product, he would help me think
        through the problem. He wouldn't freak out.</p>
<p class="docText">I emailed Dan asking for about 30 minutes of his time for help
        with this problem. He should let me know and I would go over to his
        office. Dan has that lazy look that masks a brilliant brain. He's the
        kind of person who ambles rather than strides, who looks as if he's
        half-asleep and then says something that stuns you with its
        brilliance. If anyone had ideas about what to do, it would be
        Dan.</p>
<p class="docText">About 10 minutes later, Dan sauntered over. "Hey, thanks for
        coming over. Want to go to your office?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Nope, I bet you have all the task information here."</p>
<p class="docText">"You're right. Let's take a look. I don't want to lose another
        week. I also don't want to stop the code reviews&mdash;or the unit tests&mdash;but
        Big Cheese is having a bird. I need to show some progress next
        week."</p>
<p class="docText">"Did he threaten to fire you?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Yup."</p>
<p class="docText">Dan paused for a minute and frowned. "Uh-oh. He usually only
        threatens to fire Nancy. The last time he threatened to fire a
        manager, he did."</p>
<p class="docText">"When was that?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Two weeks ago."</p>
<p class="docText">Oops. I was in trouble.</p>
<p class="docText">"Dan, I am not going to change what the group is doing. The code
        reviews and unit tests are working. But I would like to keep my job&mdash;at
        least for a few more weeks. Do you have any ideas about what to
        do?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Well, we could have a whole-team review of Fred's code to see
        where the problem is. Has Fred instrumented the code, so he knows
        where it's slow?"</p>
<p class="docText">"He told me he had, but I didn't review the instrumentation.
        Maybe he's missing something?"</p>
<p class="docText">"Yeah, maybe it's time to review the instrumentation. Maybe we
        need more data, too, about where and why Fred thinks it's too
        slow."</p>
<p class="docText">"Dan, let's talk about where you are. I
        think Fred needs more help, <a name="idx-CHP-27-0864"></a>and you have as much experience with this code base as
        he does. If you help him, what do we need to do about your
        work?"</p>
<p class="docText">Dan and I discussed options for his work, and decided not to
        change his work yet. Dan would ask Fred about performance tests, and
        suggest a test review and a code review. Dan might suggest an
        instrumentation review. But that's all Dan would do until I met with
        Fred on Tuesday&mdash;unless Fred asked for help.</p>
<p class="docText">I was still concerned. It's not every day a senior manager
        threatens to fire you. But it was clear to me that the team had
        accepted me because I was helping them get their work done. I wasn't
        going to prevent them from finishing the work. But I did need a
        plan.</p>
