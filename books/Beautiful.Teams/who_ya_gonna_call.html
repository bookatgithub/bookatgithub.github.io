<h3 id="643999-970" class="docSection1Title">19.7. Who Ya Gonna Call?</h3>
<p class="docText">In 1986, my small development group at Contoso realized we had
        to learn how to interact more closely with our users so that we could
        properly meet their software needs. We conceived the project role of
        <span class="docEmphasis">product champion</span>, a key user representative who
        works closely with the requirements analyst. The product champion
        serves as the literal voice of the customer for a particular user
        class. <a name="idx-CHP-19-0578"></a>Product champions typically are experienced users and
        subject matter experts in their domain.<a name="idx-CHP-19-0579"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Our next step on the CTS project, therefore, is to identify
        champions for the four user classes. My previous group had created a
        list of possible product champion activities that the CTS analysts can
        present to each candidate champion so that they understand what
        they're getting into. Negotiating the exact
        responsibilities that each champion is willing to accept is an
        important part of crafting that vital collaborative
        customer-development partnership.</p>
<p class="docText">As the key manager on the spot and a hands-on user of the future
        system, Paul is the obvious <a name="idx-CHP-19-0580"></a>product champion for the Health and Safety Department.
        Our project manager and lead analyst, Janet, will work with Paul to
        define his <a name="idx-CHP-19-0581"></a>requirements. A member of the Purchasing Department
        named Jonathan is willing to present requirements for the CTS from his
        community's perspective. Our second analyst, Devon, agrees to work
        with Jonathan on Purchasing's requirements. Dana manages the chemical
        stockroom. She's the natural <a name="idx-CHP-19-0582"></a>product champion for that user class, although she'll
        obtain additional input from the members of her staff who perform the
        day-to-day operations. Janet will do double-duty to lead requirements
        elicitation with Dana.</p>
<p class="docText">Finding a product champion for the chemist group is more
        challenging. Dana tries to help. "Before I became the chemical
        stockroom manager, I was a laboratory chemist," she tells us.
        "Therefore, you don't need to talk to any other chemists about their
        requirements. I can tell you everything you need to know."</p>
<p class="docText">Although Dana is sincere and means well, she is wrong. And it's
        really hard to convince her that she's wrong. The first problem is
        that she's no longer a member of the chemist user class. She is
        literally the best person in the world to describe the needs of the
        chemical stockroom staff. She isn't, however, a practicing chemist
        anymore. I learned long ago that it is best to have actual members of
        the user class participate in requirements development, rather than
        using surrogates or former members of that user class. In some cases,
        particularly on commercial product development projects, you don't
        have direct access to appropriate user representatives, so you must
        use surrogates, such as product managers or marketing staff. That
        isn't a problem for this internal corporate project, where we can
        arrange to work with actual users.</p>
<p class="docText">The second concern we have with Dana's offer is that she has a
        narrow and parochial view of the chemists' requirements. She is also
        very adamant about her opinions on such matters, and she is prone to
        crying when discussions get a bit tense or her opinions are not
        immediately accepted. (Dana isn't all that much fun to work with.)
        Relying on Dana's strong opinions alone would not provide the rich
        understanding of chemist needs that we need to get. So, we politely
        decline Dana's offer and go searching for a suitable chemist
        representative.</p>
<p class="docText">We find one! A highly experienced and respected chemist named
        Sarah offers to serve as the product champion. Although she isn't
        terribly sophisticated when it comes to computers, Sarah recognizes
        the value that the Chemical Tracking System will provide to her and
        her colleagues. It's common that the people best suited as
        representatives for their user class are already overextended in their
        own work and are reluctant to commit much time to requirements-related
        activities. We really luck out with Sarah, though. She promises to
        create time in her busy schedule for requirements elicitation
        discussions and review sessions. Since my own educational background
        is in chemistry, I will be the analyst working with Sarah to
        understand the requirements that chemists have for CTS.</p>
<p class="docText">We realize it's just not realistic to
        expect even an experienced chemist like Sarah to know the full
        spectrum of <a name="idx-CHP-19-0583"></a><a name="idx-CHP-19-0584"></a>requirements for all the chemists at Contoso. She needs
        some help. We establish a backup team of five additional chemists
        drawn from various departments across the company. They will have many
        requirements in common, but these representatives know about specific
        needs that pertain to the kinds of chemical work going on in their own
        areas.</p>
<p class="docText">We don't expect Sarah alone to produce the chemists'
        requirements, or even Sarah plus the backup team. Each of our
        <a name="idx-CHP-19-0585"></a>product champions is responsible for interacting
        <a name="idx-CHP-19-0586"></a>with other members of his or her user class to collect
        ideas and get feedback on proposals. The <a name="idx-CHP-19-0587"></a>product champion also will resolve requirements
        conflicts that arise between individual members of the user class,
        which makes the analysts' lives much easier. So, in this
        representative engagement model, the primary pipelines through which
        requirements flow are from each product champion to the corresponding
        analyst, with extensive interactions behind the scenes between the
        champion and other users. The analyst will need to work with the
        various <a name="idx-CHP-19-0588"></a>product champions to resolve requirements conflicts that
        arise between the user classes.</p>
<p class="docText">Now we're ready to roll. <a class="docLink" href="#requirements_elicitation_participants_fo">Table 19-1</a> shows the
        complete cast of key participants in the requirements elicitation
