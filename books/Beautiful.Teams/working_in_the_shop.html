<p class="docText">Instead of conducting many individual interviews <a name="idx-CHP-19-0591"></a>with user representatives, we decide to hold a series of
        facilitated requirements elicitation workshops. Each analyst will meet
        periodically with his or her user representatives to learn about the
        goals those users hope to accomplish with the help of the CTS. The
        analyst will serve as the facilitator and recorder for each workshop
        (although we soon learn that sometimes it's helpful to split these two
        roles). Having teams of users put their heads together saves the time
        often needed to resolve the conflicts that arise when individuals are
        interviewed sequentially. The synergy of a group discussion also
        generates new ideas and helps the participants reach a shared vision
        of the ultimate product.</p>
<p class="docText">We elect to hold workshops for the different user classes
        separately. We've subdivided our users into multiple user classes with
        largely different requirements, so it doesn't make sense to have them
        all participate in the same workshop sessions.</p>
<p class="docText">I lead the workshops with our chemist user representatives&mdash;the
        product champion, Sarah, and the five members of her backup team. In
        keeping with the spirit of having teams agree on how they're going to
        collaborate, we establish some ground rules for each workshop group.
        One of our ground rules is that the sessions will begin and end on
        time; we don't wait for people who straggle in late. Another rule is
        that the participants who show up to a workshop constitute a
        decision-making quorum. If someone is unable to attend, he's invited
        to submit his input beforehand or to send a delegate. He'll also be
        able to review the results of each workshop. But those who attend will
        make the necessary decisions so that we can move along expeditiously.
        Agreeing on these and other ground rules is an important part of
        defining an effective and efficient collaborative team
        experience.</p>
<p class="docText">Before we hold our first workshop, I invite
        the chemists to think of "things chemists would need to do <a name="idx-CHP-19-0592"></a>with the CTS." Each of these "things to do" becomes a
        candidate use case that we will explore in the workshops. Some are big
        things (Request a Chemical); some are small (View a Stored Request). I
        schedule our first workshop, planning to start with what seem to be
        the most important use cases.</p>
<p class="docText">Not certain exactly how to proceed, I refer to the conference
        presentation notes I mentioned earlier. The speaker described a
        technique for <a name="idx-CHP-19-0593"></a>using flip charts and sticky notes to capture the
        essential components of a use case. These components include:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Use case name</p></li><li><p class="docList">Name of the actor who will execute the use case (to a first
            approximation, an <span class="docEmphasis">actor</span> is a type of
            user)</p></li><li><p class="docList">A brief description of the use case and its priority</p></li><li><p class="docList">Preconditions that must be satisfied before the system can
            initiate the use case</p></li><li><p class="docList">Postconditions that reflect the state of the universe at the
            successful completion of use case execution</p></li><li><p class="docList">The normal flow, which describes the most typical set of
            interactions between an actor and the system that lead to a
            successful outcome</p></li><li><p class="docList">Alternative flows, which describe other ways the actor might
            perform the use case (branching options and other
            variations)</p></li><li><p class="docList">Exceptions, which are possible ways the use case might fail
            to complete execution successfully</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">I am pleased when this flip-chart approach appears to work well
        in our workshop. I'm further pleased when my chemists are receptive to
        the use case approach. Use cases are comfortable for many users
        because they relate directly to their business and how they anticipate
        using the system in that business. As we gain experience, I learn how
        to facilitate the workshops more effectively, to limit them to about
        two and a half hours in duration, and to time-box the discussion on
        each use case so that we don't get bogged down. I also learn that it's
        important to keep the use case discussion at the right level of
        abstraction. We avoid drilling down into excessive detail, such as
        user interface specifics, prematurely.</p>
<p class="docText">I am Lewis (or maybe Clark) in this use case exploration. We
        don't know anyone who has applied use cases before, so I do my best to
        blaze the trail. Once the chemists get into a rhythm and start making
        progress, the other analysts sit in on one of my workshops to observe
        our approach and determine how they want to adapt the method to their
        own user groups. Janet and Devon hold their own workshops in a similar
        style and also make good progress with their users. The three analysts
        work independently, but we share our experiences and insights so we
        can all learn to do a better job. All software team members can work
        more effectively if they learn by looking over the shoulders of their
        colleagues.</p>
