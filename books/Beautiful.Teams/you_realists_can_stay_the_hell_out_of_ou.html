<p class="docText">I can easily say that my fondest memories of <a name="idx-CHP-7-0185"></a>MP3.com stem from sharing an office with David and GK.
        For starters, we decided that rather than have someone sit with their
        back facing the window, all three of us would set up our desks
        adjacent to each other so that two of us were sitting perpendicular to
        the window&mdash;just look 90 degrees and you have a view&mdash;and the third
        facing toward the window, forming three sides of a square with the
        window as the fourth and our jungle arrangement of plants in the
        center. Next, we brought in musical instruments&mdash;GK brought a guitar,
        bass, and didgeridoo, Dave brought a guitar amp,
        and I brought my bass amp, and, well, we were wired, instruments
        hanging from hooks on the wall, just calling out to you anytime you
        had coder's block and needed a few to get your neurons to fire around
        the problem instead of slamming your head against the wall.</p>
<p class="docText">A completely unintended consequence of this was due to the large
        number of amazing musicians who worked at <a name="idx-CHP-7-0186"></a>MP3.com. I can still remember the first time Rattlesnake
        Ray Matthews, currently a web designer, walked into our office and,
        without saying a word, walked past where GK and I were sitting, picked
        the guitar off the wall, plugged in, and let loose with this amazing
        blues lick for something like two minutes before unplugging, hanging
        up the guitar, and leaving. Un. Fucking. Believable. I don't think any
        of us had even known that he could play before that. This ended up
        happening probably about twice a month, and it was just a welcome
        relief and always brought a smile to our faces. (It turns out that Ray
        had been a session musician for a good long while, even touring as
        Madonna's guitarist, I believe, and was now working a straight job
        to&mdash;among other things&mdash;put his kid through school.)</p>
<p class="docText">The dynamic in our office was one that fostered communication&mdash;or
        more specifically, discussion. GK was a philosophy major from Texas
        A&amp;M turned software engineer, David was a vegan and a Buddhist who
        had grown up under interesting circumstances in Detroit, and I was,
        well, the consummate devil's advocate, a jack-of-all-trades, and a
        person with an interesting take on life. Topics ranged from the nature
        of addiction to the best Beastie Boys album (<span class="docEmphasis">Paul's
        Boutique</span> was groundbreaking, but <span class="docEmphasis">Check Your
        Head</span> was funkier and a better overall album with a deeper
        groove), dissertations on how the mind processed information to our
        ability to define our own destiny, and assertions from David and GK
        that "reality" was strictly a function of subjective perception (and
        therefore non-existent). There was a crazy energy about it all, and a
        bit of magic in the air with occurrences like a plastic bag floating
        up in front of our office window, cued by our discussing the symbolism
        of the plastic bag in the recently released movie <span class="docEmphasis">American
        Beauty</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">It wasn't all "philosophical discussions on the true nature of
        the proletariat in American society," either. David and I would
        regularly check each other's Perl code, or at least provide a second
        set of eyes and an ear for a sounding board. More often than not, just
        this process of trying to <span class="docEmphasis">describe</span> a problem you
        were coming up against was enough to turn on the light bulb and allow
        you to solve the problem yourself, but the talking it through was an
        integral part of the process. The whole dynamic was one that fostered
        a healthy work environment, where 75% of the time you sat there
        working in silence&mdash;headphones on, or someone choosing the next album
        without being asked&mdash;and the rest of the time you felt OK asking for
        help should you get stuck &#8230; but you waited until you
        <span class="docEmphasis">were</span> stuck.</p>
<p class="docText">I did feel bad for the folks who reported to GK, though. It
        seemed like once a week someone would come in and patiently wait for
        us to finish whatever bizarre tangent we were pursuing, sometimes
        sitting there for 10 minutes before we finished&mdash;or before they left
        because it really wasn't that important. The odd thing was that it was
        rare for anyone to jump in and contribute, which always just struck me
        as a bit weird.</p>
<p class="docText">Brian Callahan probably bore the brunt of
        our tangents, as he was frequently popping by the office for
        direction. When he finally left <a name="idx-CHP-7-0187"></a>MP3.com to seek his own fortunes, he posted a long
        missive of fond memories and other minutiae to the internal BBS. His
        tribute to our office was "I dare anyone who considers themselves a
        realist to drop by David and GK's office" (I had since moved
        elsewhere), to which David promptly responded:</p>
<p class="docText">"You realists can stay the hell out of our office."</p>
<p class="docText">'Nuff said.</p>
