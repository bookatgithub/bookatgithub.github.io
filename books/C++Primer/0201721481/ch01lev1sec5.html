<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="432172-979">1.5. Introducing Classes</h3>
<p class="docText">The only remaining feature we need to understand before solving our bookstore problem is how to write a <span class="docEmphBoldItalic"><a name="ch01term14"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch01lev1sec8.html#gloss01_14">data structure</a></span> to represent our transaction data. In C++ we define our own data structure by defining a <B><a name="ch01term7"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch01lev1sec8.html#gloss01_07">class</a></b>. The class mechanism is one of the most important features in C++. In fact, a primary focus of the design of C++ is to make it possible to define <B><a name="ch01term8"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch01lev1sec8.html#gloss01_08">class types</a></b> that behave as naturally as the built-in types themselves. The library types that we've seen already, such as <tt>istream</tt> and <tt>ostream</tt>, are all defined as classesthat is, they are not strictly speaking part of the language.</p>
<p class="docText">Complete understanding of the class mechanism requires mastering a lot of information. Fortunately, it is possible to use a class that someone else has written without knowing how to define a class ourselves. In this section, we'll describe a simple class that we can use in solving our bookstore problem. We'll implement <a name="idd1e3819"></a><a name="idd1e3824"></a><a name="idd1e3830"></a><a name="idd1e3834"></a><a name="idd1e3840"></a>this class in the subsequent chapters as we learn more about types, expressions, statements, and functionsall of which are used in defining classes.</P>
<p class="docText">To use a class we need to know three things:</p>
<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">What is its name?</P></div></LI><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Where is it defined?</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">What operations does it support?</p></div></LI></ol></div>
<p class="docText">For our bookstore problem, we'll assume that the class is named <tt>Sales_item</tt> and that it is defined in a header named <tt>Sales_item.h</tt>.</p>
<a name="ch01lev2sec9"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.5.1. The <tt>Sales_item</tt> Class</H4>
<p class="docText">The purpose of the <tt>Sales_item</tt> class is to store an ISBN and keep track of the number of copies sold, the revenue, and average sales price for that book. How these data are stored or computed is not our concern. To use a class, we need not know anything about how it is implemented. Instead, what we need to know is what operations the class provides.</p>
<p class="docText">As we've seen, when we use library facilities such as IO, we must include the associated headers. Similarly, for our own classes, we must make the definitions associated with the class available to the compiler. We do so in much the same way. Typically, we put the class definition into a file. Any program that wants to use our class must include that file.</p>
<p class="docText">Conventionally, class types are stored in a file with a name that, like the name of a program source file, has two parts: a file name and a file suffix. Usually the file name is the same as the class defined in the header. The suffix usually is <tt>.h</tt>, but some programmers use <tt>.H, .hpp</tt>, or <tt>.hxx</tt>. Compilers usually aren't picky about header file names, but IDEs sometimes are. We'll assume that our class is defined in a file named <tt>Sales_item.h</tt>.</p>
<a name="ch01lev3sec7"></a>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">Operations on <tt>Sales_item</tt> Objects</H5>
<p class="docText">Every class defines a type. The type name is the same as the name of the class. Hence, our <tt>Sales_item</tt> class defines a type named <tt>Sales_item</tt>. As with the built-in types, we can define a variable of a class type. When we write</p>
<pre>
    Sales_item item;
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">we are saying that <tt>item</tt> is an object of type <tt>Sales_item</tt>. We often contract the phrase &quot;an object of type <tt>Sales_item&quot;</tt> to&quot;aSales_ <tt>item</tt> object&quot; or even more simply to &quot;a <tt>Sales_item.&quot;</tt></p>
<p class="docText">In addition to being able to define variables of type <tt>Sales_item</tt>, we can perform the following operations on <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects:</p>
<UL><li><p class="docList">Use the addition operator, <tt>+</tt>, to add two <tt>Sales_item</tt>s</p></LI><li><p class="docList">Use the input operator, <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> to read a <tt>Sales_item</tt> object,</p></LI><li><p class="docList">Use the output operator, <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> to write a <tt>Sales_item</tt> object</P></li><li><p class="docList">Use the assignment operator, <tt>=</tt>, to assign one <tt>Sales_item</tt> object to another</p></li><li><p class="docList">Call the <tt>same_isbn</tt> function to determine if two <tt>Sales_item</tt>s refer to the same book</p></li></ul>

<a name="ch01lev3sec8"></a>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Reading and Writing <tt>Sales_item</tt>s</h5>
<p class="docText">Now that we know the operations that the class provides, we can write some simple programs to use this class. For example, the following program reads data from the standard input, uses that data to build a <tt>Sales_item</tt> object, and writes that <tt>Sales_item</tt> object back onto the standard output:</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "Sales_item.h"
    int main()
    {
        Sales_item book;
        // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">read ISBN, number of copies sold, and sales price</span>
        std::cin &gt;&gt; book;
        // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">write ISBN, number of copies sold, total revenue, and average price</span>
        std::cout &lt;&lt; book &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">If the input to this program is</p>
<pre>
    <span class="docEmphStrong">0-201-70353-X 4 24.99</span>
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">then the output will be</P>
<pre>
    <span class="docEmphStrong">0-201-70353-X 4 99.96 24.99</span>
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">Our input said that we sold four copies of the book at $24.99 each, and the output indicates that the total sold was four, the total revenue was $99.96, and the average price per book was $24.99.</P>
<p class="docText">This program starts with two <tt>#include</tt> directives, one of which uses a new form. The <tt>iostream</tt> header is defined by the standard library; the <tt>Sales_item</tt> header is not. <tt>Sales_item</tt> is a type that we ourselves have defined. When we use our own headers, we use quotation marks (<tt>" "</tt>) to surround the header name.</p>
<a name="ch01note06"></a><div class="docNote"><p>
<table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><TR><TD width="60" valign="top"><img border="0" alt="" id="195131139046" align="LEFT" width="50" height="54" SRC="images/0201721481/graphics/note.jpg;400478"></td><td valign="top"><p class="docText"> Headers for the standard library are enclosed in angle brackets (<tt>&lt; &gt;</tt>). Nonstandard headers are enclosed in double quotes (<tt>" "</tt>).</p></td></tr></table><BR>
</p></div><BR>
<p class="docText">Inside <tt>main</tt> we start by defining an object, named <tt>book</tt>, which we'll use to hold the data that we read from the standard input. The next statement reads into that object, and the third statement prints it to the standard output followed as usual by printing <tt>endl</tt> to flush the buffer.</P>
<a name="ch01sb12"></a><p><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td>
<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">Key Concept: Classes Define Behavior</H2>
<p class="docText"><a name="idd1e4123"></a><span class="docEmphStrong">As we go through these programs that use <tt>Sales_item</tt>s, the important thing to keep in mind is that the author of the <tt>Sales_item</tt> class defined <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> the actions that can be performed by objects of this class. That is, the author of the <tt>Sales_item</tt> data structure defines what happens when a <tt>Sales_item</tt> object is created and what happens when the addition or the input and output operators are applied to <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">In general, only the operations defined by a class can be used on objects of the class type. For now, the only operations we know we can peeform on <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects are the ones listed on page <a class="docLink" href="#ch01lev2sec9">21</a>.</span></p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">We'll see how these operations are defined in <a class="docLink" href="ch07lev1sec7.html#ch07lev2sec24">Sections 7.7.3</a> and <a class="docLink" href="ch14lev1sec2.html#ch14lev1sec2">14.2</a>.</span></p>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">Adding <tt>Sales_item</tt>s</h5>
<p class="docText">A slightly more interesting example adds two <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects:</p>
<pre>
     #include &lt;iostream&gt;
     #include "Sales_item.h"
     int main()
     {
        Sales_item item1, item2;
        std::cin &gt;&gt; item1 &gt;&gt; item2;   // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">read a pair of transactions</span>
        std::cout &lt;&lt; item1 + item2 &lt;&lt; std::endl; // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">print their sum</span>
        return 0;
     }
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">If we give this program the following input</p>
<pre>
     <span class="docEmphStrong">0-201-78345-X 3 20.00</span>
     <span class="docEmphStrong">0-201-78345-X 2 25.00</span>
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">our output is</p>
<pre>
     <span class="docEmphStrong">0-201-78345-X 5 110 22</span>
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">This program starts by including the <tt>Sales_item</tt> and <tt>iostream</tt> headers. Next we define two <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects to hold the two transactions that we wish to sum. The output expression does the addition and prints the result. We know from the list of operations on page <a class="docLink" href="#ch01lev2sec9">21</a> that adding two <tt>Sales_item</tt>s together creates a new object whose ISBN is that of its operands and whose number sold and revenue reflect the sum of the corresponding values in its operands. We also know that the items we add must represent the same ISBN.</p>
<p class="docText">It's worth noting how similar this program looks to the one on page <a class="docLink" href="ch01lev1sec2.html#ch01lev2sec3">6</a>: We read two inputs and write their sum. What makes it interesting is that instead of reading and printing the sum of two integers, we're reading and printing the sum of two <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects. Moreover, the whole idea of &quot;sum&quot; is different. In the case of <tt>int</tt>s we are generating a conventional sumthe result of adding two numeric values. In the case of <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects we use a conceptually new meaning for sumthe result of adding the components of two <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects.</p>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.5.2. A First Look at Member Functions</h4>
<p class="docText">Unfortunately, there is a problem with the program that adds <tt>Sales_item</tt>s. What should happen if the input referred to two different ISBNs? It doesn't make sense to add the data for two different ISBNs together. To solve this problem, we'll first check whether the <tt>Sales_item</tt> operands refer to the same ISBNs:</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "Sales_item.h"
    int main()
    {
        Sales_item item1, item2;
        std::cin &gt;&gt; item1 &gt;&gt; item2;
        // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">first check that</span> <span class="docEmphasis">item1</span> <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">and</span> <span class="docEmphasis">item2</span> <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">represent the same book</span>
        if (item1.same_isbn(item2)) {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; item1 + item2 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
            return 0;    // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">indicate success</span>
        } else {
            std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Data must refer to same ISBN"
                      &lt;&lt; std::endl;
            return -1; // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">indicate failure</span>
        }
    }
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">The difference between this program and the previous one is the <tt>if</tt> test and its associated <tt>else</tt> branch. Before explaining the <tt>if</tt> condition, we know that what this program does depends on the condition in the <tt>if</tt>. If the test succeeds, then we write the same output as the previous program and return <tt>0</tt> indicating success. If the test fails, we execute the block following the <tt>else</tt>, which prints a message and returns an error indicator.</p>

<h5 class="docSection3Title">What Is a Member Function?</H5>

A member function is a function that is defined by a class. Member functions are sometimes referred to as the <b><a name="ch01term30"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch01lev1sec8.html#gloss01_30">methods</a></b> of the class.</p>
<p class="docText">Member functions are defined once for the class but are treated as members of each object. We refer to these operations as member functions because they (usually) operate on a specific object. In this sense, they are members of the object, even though a single definition is shared by all objects of the same type.</p>
<p class="docText">When we call a member function, we (usually) specify the object on which the function will operate. This syntax uses the <b><a name="ch01term50"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch01lev1sec8.html#gloss01_50">dot operator</a></b> (the &quot;.&quot; operator):</p>
<pre>
    item1.same_isbn
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">means &quot;the <tt>same_isbn</tt> member of the object named <tt>item1</tt>.&quot; The dot operator fetches its right-hand operand from its left. The dot operator applies only to objects of class type: The left-hand operand must be an object of class type; the right-hand operand must name a member of that type.</p>
<a name="ch01note07"></a><div class="docNote"><p>
<table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td width="60" valign="top"><img border="0" alt="" id="195131139046" align="LEFT" width="50" height="54" SRC="images/0201721481/graphics/note.jpg;400478"></td><td valign="top"><p class="docText"> Unlike most other operators, the right operand of the dot (&quot;<tt>.</tt>&quot;) operator is not an object or value; it is the name of a member.</P></TD></tr></table><BR>
</p></div><br>
<p class="docText">When we use a member function as the right-hand operand of the dot operator, we usually do so to call that function. We execute a member function in much the same way as we do any function: To call a function, we follow the function name by the <B><a name="ch01term47"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch01lev1sec8.html#gloss01_47">call operator</a></b> (the &quot;<tt>()</tt>&quot; operator). The call operator is a pair of parentheses that encloses a (possibly empty) list of <span class="docEmphBoldItalic"><a name="ch01term1"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch01lev1sec8.html#gloss01_01">arguments</a></span> that we pass to the function.</P>
<p class="docText">The <tt>same_isbn</tt> function takes a single argument, and that argument is another <tt>Sales_item</tt> object. The call</p>
<pre>
    item1.same_isbn(item2)
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">passes <tt>item2</tt> as an argument to the function named <tt>same_isbn</tt> that is a member of the object named <tt>item1</tt>. This function compares the ISBN part of its argument, <tt>item2</tt>, to the ISBN in <tt>item1</tt>, the object on which <tt>same_isbn</tt> is called. Thus, the effect is to test whether the two objects refer to the same ISBN.</p>
<p class="docText">If the objects refer to the same ISBN, we execute the statement following the <tt>if</tt>, which prints the result of adding the two <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects together. Otherwise, if they refer to different ISBNs, we execute the <tt>else</tt> branch, which is a block of statements. The block prints an appropriate error message and exits the program, returning <tt>-1</tt>. Recall that the return from <tt>main</tt> is treated as a status indicator. In this case, we return a nonzero value to indicate that the program failed to produce the expected result.</p>
