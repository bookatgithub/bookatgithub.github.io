In this section we'll see how to define a header file for the <tt>Sales_item</tt> class.</P>
<p class="docText">In fact, C++ programs use headers to contain more than class definitions. Recall that every name must be declared or defined before it is used. The programs we've written so far handle this requirement by putting all their code into a single file. As long as each entity precedes the code that uses it, this strategy works. However, few programs are so simple that they can be written in a single file. Programs made up of multiple files need a way to link the use of a name and its declaration. In C++ that is done through header files.</p>
<p class="docText">To allow programs to be broken up into logical parts, C++ supports what is commonly known as <B><a name="ch02term50"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec11.html#gloss02_50"><span class="docEmphasis">separate compilation</span></a></b>. Separate compilation lets us compose a program from several files. To support separate compilation, we'll put the definition of <tt>Sales_item</tt> in a header file. The member functions for <tt>Sales_item</tt>, which we'll define in <a class="docLink" href="ch07lev1sec7.html#ch07lev1sec7">Section 7.7</a> (p. <a class="docLink" href="ch07lev1sec7.html#ch07lev1sec7">258</a>), will go in a separate source file. Functions such as <tt>main</tt> that use <tt>Sales_item</tt> objects are in other source files. Each of the source files that use <tt>Sales_item</tt> must include our <tt>Sales_item.h</tt> header file.</p>
<a name="ch02lev2sec30"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">2.9.1. Designing Our Own Headers</H4>
<p class="docText">A header provides a centralized location for related declarations. Headers normally contain class definitions, <tt>extern</tt> variable declarations, and function declarations, about which we'll learn in <a class="docLink" href="ch07lev1sec4.html#ch07lev1sec4">Section 7.4</a> (p. <a class="docLink" href="ch07lev1sec4.html#ch07lev1sec4">251</a>). Files that use or define these entities include the appropriate header(s).</P>
<p class="docText">Proper use of header files can provide two benefits: All files are guaranteed to use the same declaration for a given entity; and should a declaration require change, only the header needs to be updated.</p>
<p class="docText">Some care should be taken in designing headers. The declarations in a header should logically belong together. A header takes time to compile. If it is too large programmers may be reluctant to incur the compile-time cost of including it.</p>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">Headers Are for Declarations, Not Definitions</h5>
<p class="docText">When designing a header it is essential to remember the difference between definitions, which may only occur once, and declarations, which may occur multiple times (<a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec3.html#ch02lev2sec14">Section 2.3.5</a>, p. <a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec3.html#ch02lev2sec14">52</a>). The following statements are definitions and therefore should not appear in a header:</p>
<pre>
     extern int ival = 10;      // <span class="docEmphasis">initializer, so it's a definition</span>
     double fica_rate;          // <span class="docEmphasis">no extern, so it's a definition</span>
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">Although <tt>ival</tt> is declared <tt>extern</tt>, it has an initializer, which means this statement is a definition. Similarly, the declaration of <tt>fica_rate</tt>, although it does not <a name="idd1e13470"></a><a name="idd1e13475"></a><a name="idd1e13478"></a>have an initializer, is a definition because the <tt>extern</tt> keyword is absent. Including either of these definitions in two or more files of the same program will result in a linker error complaining about multiple definitions.</p>

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">Compiling and Linking Multiple Source Files</h2>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">To produce an executable file, we must tell the compiler not only where to find our <tt>main</tt> function but also where to find the definition of the member functions defined by the <tt>Sales_item</tt> class. Let's assume that we have two files: <tt>main.cc</tt>, which contains the definition of <tt>main</tt>, and <tt>Sales_item.cc</tt>, which contains the <tt>Sales_item</tt> member functions. We might compile these files as follows:</span></p>
<pre>
     $ CC -c main.cc Sales_item.cc # by default generates a.exe
                                   # some compilers generate a.out

</p></div><BR>
<p class="docText">There are three exceptions to the rule that headers should not contain definitions: classes, <tt>const</tt> objects whose value is known at compile time, and <tt>inline</tt> functions (<a class="docLink" href="ch07lev1sec6.html#ch07lev1sec6">Section 7.6</a> (p. <a class="docLink" href="ch07lev1sec6.html#ch07lev1sec6">256</a>) covers <tt>inline</tt> functions) are all defined in headers. <a name="idd1e13604"></a><a name="idd1e13610"></a><a name="idd1e13615"></a><a name="idd1e13620"></a>These entities may be defined in more than one source file as long as the definitions in each file are exactly the same.</P>
<p class="docText">These entities are defined in headers because the compiler needs their definitions (not just declarations) to generate code. For example, to generate code that defines or uses objects of a class type, the compiler needs to know what data members make up that type. It also needs to know what operations can be performed on these objects. The class definition provides the needed information. That <tt>const</tt> objects are defined in a header may require a bit more explanation.</p>

<a name="ch02lev3sec14"></a>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Some <tt>const</tt> Objects Are Defined in Headers</h5>
<p class="docText">Recall that by default a <tt>const</tt> variable (<a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec4.html#ch02lev1sec4">Section 2.4</a>, p. <a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec4.html#ch02lev1sec4">57</a>) is local to the file in which it is defined. As we shall now see, the reason for this default is to allow <tt>const</tt> variables to be defined in header files.</P>
<p class="docText">In C++ there are places where constant expression (<a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec7.html#ch02lev1sec7">Section 2.7</a>, p. <a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec7.html#ch02lev1sec7">62</a>) is required. For example, the initializer of an enumerator must be a constant expression. We'll see other cases that require constant expressions in later chapters.</P>
<p class="docText">Generally speaking, a constant expression is an expression that the compiler can evaluate at compile-time. A <tt>const</tt> variable of integral type may be a constant expression when it is itself initialized from a constant expression. However, for the <tt>const</tt> to be a constant expression, the initializer must be visible to the compiler. To allow multiple files to use the same constant value, the <tt>const</tt> and its initializer must be visible in each file. To make the initializer visible, we normally define such <tt>const</tt>s inside a header file. That way the compiler can see the initializer whenever the <tt>const</tt> is used.</p>
<p class="docText">However, there can be only one definition (<a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec3.html#ch02lev2sec14">Section 2.3.5</a>, p. <a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec3.html#ch02lev2sec14">52</a>) for any variable in a C++ program. A definition allocates storage; all uses of the variable must refer to the same storage. Because, by default, <tt>const</tt> objects are local to the file in which they are defined, it is legal to put their definition in a header file.</p>
<p class="docText">There is one important implication of this behavior. When we define a <tt>const</tt> in a header file, every source file that includes that header has its own <tt>const</tt> variable with the same name and value.</p>
<p class="docText">When the <tt>const</tt> is initialized by a constant expression, then we are guaranteed that all the variables will have the same value. Moreover, in practice, most compilers will replace any use of such <tt>const</tt> variables by their corresponding constant expression at compile time. So, in practice, there won't be any storage used to hold <tt>const</tt> variables that are initialized by constant expressions.</p>
<p class="docText">When a <tt>const</tt> is initialized by a value that is not a constant expression, then it should not be defined in header file. Instead, as with any other variable, the <tt>const</tt> should be defined and initialized in a source file. An <tt>extern</tt> declaration for that <tt>const</tt> should be made in the header, enabling multiple files to share that variable.</P>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">2.9.2. A Brief Introduction to the Preprocessor</h4>
<p class="docText">Now that we know what we want to put in our headers, our next problem is to actually write a header. We know that to use a header we have to <tt>#include</tt> it in our <a name="idd1e13749"></a>source file.

<p class="docText">A <tt>#include</tt> directive takes a single argument: the name of a header. The pre-processor replaces each <tt>#include</tt> by the contents of the specified header. Our own headers are stored in files. System headers may be stored in a compiler-specific format that is more efficient. Regardless of the form in which a header is stored, it ordinarily contains class definitions and declarations of the variables and functions needed to support separate compilation.</P>
<a name="ch02lev3sec15"></a>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">Headers Often Need Other Headers</h5>
<p class="docText">Headers often <tt>#include</tt> other headers. The entities that a header defines often use facilities from other headers. For example, the header that defines our <tt>Sales_item</tt> class must include the <tt>string</tt> library. The <tt>Sales_item</tt> class has a <tt>string</tt> data member and so must have access to the <tt>string</tt> header.</p>
<p class="docText">Including other headers is so common that it is not unusual for a header to be included more than once in the same source file. For example, a program that used the <tt>Sales_item</tt> header might also use the <tt>string</tt> library. That program wouldn'tindeed shouldn'tknow that our <tt>Sales_item</tt> header uses the <tt>string</tt> library. In this case, the <tt>string</tt> header would be included twice: once by the program itself and once as a side-effect of including our <tt>Sales_item</tt> header.</p>
<p class="docText">Accordingly, it is important to design header files so that they can be included more than once in a single source file. We must ensure that including a header file <a name="idd1e13875"></a><a name="idd1e13879"></a><a name="idd1e13883"></a><a name="idd1e13887"></a><a name="idd1e13890"></a><a name="idd1e13893"></a>more than once does not cause multiple definitions of the classes and objects that the header file defines. A common way to make headers safe uses the preprocessor to define a <b><a name="ch02term23"></a><a class="docLink" href="ch02lev1sec11.html#gloss02_23">header guard</a></b>. The guard is used to avoid reprocessing the contents of a header file if the header has already been seen.</P>

<a name="ch02lev3sec16"></a>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Avoiding Multiple Inclusions</h5>
<p class="docText">Before we write our own header, we need to introduce some additional preprocessor facilities. The preprocessor lets us define our own variables.</P>
<a name="ch02note23"></a><div class="docNote"><p>
<table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><TD width="60" valign="top"><img border="0" alt="" align="LEFT" width="57" height="96" SRC="images/0201721481/graphics/beware.jpg;400478"></td><TD valign="top"><p class="docText"> Names used for preprocessor variables must be unique within the program. Any uses of a name that matches a preprocessor variable is assumed to refer to the preprocessor variable.</p></td></tr></table><br>
</p></div><br>
<p class="docText">To help avoid name clashes, preprocessor variables usually are written in all uppercase letters.</p>
<p class="docText">A preprocessor variable has two states: defined or not yet defined. Various preprocessor directives define and test the state of preprocessor variables. The <tt>#define</tt> directive takes a name and defines that name as a preprocessor variable. The <tt>#ifndef</tt> directive tests whether the specified preprocessor variable has not yet been defined. If it hasn't, then everything following the <tt>#ifndef</tt> is processed up to the next <tt>#endif</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText">We can use these facilities to guard against including a header more than once:</p>
<pre>
     #ifndef SALESITEM_H
     #define SALESITEM_H
     // <span class="docEmphasis">Definition of</span> Sales_itemclass <span class="docEmphasis">and related functions goes here</span>
     #endif
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">The conditional directive</p>
<pre>
     #ifndef SALESITEM_H
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">tests whether the <tt>SALESITEM_H</tt> preprocessor variable has <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> been defined. If <tt>SALESITEM_H</tt> has not been defined, the <tt>#ifndef</tt> succeeds and all the lines following <tt>#ifndef</tt> until the <tt>#endif</tt> is found are processed. Conversely, if the variable <tt>SALESITEM_H</tt> has been defined, then the <tt>#ifndef</tt> directive is false. The lines between it and the <tt>#endif</tt> directive are ignored.</p>
<p class="docText">To guarantee that the header is processed only once in a given source file, we start by testing the <tt>#ifndef</tt>. The first time the header is processed, this test will succeed, because <tt>SALESITEM_H</tt> will not yet have been defined. The next statement defines <tt>SALESITEM_H</tt>. That way, if the file we are compiling happens to include this header a second time, the <tt>#ifndef</tt> directive will discover that <tt>SALESITEM_H</tt> is defined and skip the rest of the header file.</P>

Header guards are trivial to write and can avoid mysterious compiler errors if the header subsequently is included more than once.</P></TD></tr></table><br>
</p></div><br>
<p class="docText">This strategy works well provided that no two headers define and use a pre-processor constant with the same name. We can avoid problems with duplicate preprocessor variables by naming them for an entity, such as a class, that is defined inside the header. A program can have only one class named <tt>Sales_item</tt>. By using the class name to compose the name of the header file and the preprocessor variable, we make it pretty likely that only one file will use this preprocessor variable.</p>

<p class="docText">The <tt>#include</tt> directive takes one of two forms:</P>

     #include "my_file.h"
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">If the header name is enclosed by angle brackets (<tt>&lt; &gt;</tt>), it is presumed to be a standard header. The compiler will look for it in a predefined set of locations, which can be modified by setting a search path environment variable or through a command line option. The search methods used vary significantly across compilers. We recommend you ask a colleague or consult your compiler's user's guide for further information. If the header name is enclosed by a pair of quotation marks, the header is presumed to be a nonsystem header. The search for nonsystem headers usually begins in the directory in which the source file is located.</p>
