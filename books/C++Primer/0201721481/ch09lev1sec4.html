<h3 class="docSection1Title">9.4. How a <tt>vector</tt> Grows</h3>
<p class="docText">When we <tt>insert</tt> or push an element onto a container object, the size of that object increases by one. Similarly, if we <tt>resize</tt> a container to be larger than its current <tt>size</tt>, then additional elements must be added to the container. The library takes care of allocating the memory to hold these new elements.</P>
<p class="docText">Ordinarily, we should not care about how a library type works: All we should care about is how to use it. However, in the case of <tt>vector</tt>s, a bit of the implementation leaks into its interface. To support fast random access, <tt>vector</tt> elements are stored contiguouslyeach element is adjacent to the previous element.</P>
<p class="docText">Given that elements are contiguous, let's think about what happens when we add an element to a <tt>vector</tt>: If there is no room in the <tt>vector</tt> for the new element, it cannot just add an element somewhere else in memory because the elements must be contiguous for indexing to work. Instead, the <tt>vector</tt> must allocate new memory to hold the existing elements plus the new one, copy the elements from the old location into the new space, add the new element, and deallocate the old memory. If <tt>vector</tt> did this memory allocation and deallocation each time we added an element, then performance would be unacceptably slow.</p>
<p class="docText">There is no comparable allocation issue for containers that do not hold their elements contiguously. For example, to add an element to a <tt>list</tt>, the library only needs to create the new element and chain it into the existing list. There is no need to reallocate or copy any of the existing elements.</P>
<p class="docText"><a name="idd1e69809"></a><a name="idd1e69816"></a><a name="idd1e69823"></a><a name="idd1e69830"></a><a name="idd1e69837"></a><a name="idd1e69844"></a><a name="idd1e69851"></a><a name="idd1e69858"></a>One might conclude, therefore, that in general it is a good idea to use a <tt>list</tt> rather than a <tt>vector</tt>. However, the contrary is usually the case: For most applications the best container to use is a <tt>vector</tt>. The reason is that library implementors use allocation strategies that minimize the costs of storing elements contiguously. That cost is usually offset by the advantages in accessing elements that contiguous storage allows.</p>
<p class="docText">The way <tt>vector</tt>s achieve fast allocation is by allocating capacity beyond what is immediately needed. The <tt>vector</tt> holds this storage in reserve and uses it to allocate new elements as they are added. Thus, there is no need to reallocate the container for each new element. The exact amount of additional capacity allocated varies across different implementations of the library. This allocation strategy is dramatically more efficient than reallocating the container each time an element is added. In fact, its performance is good enough that in practice a <tt>vector</tt> usually grows more efficiently than a <tt>list</tt> or a <tt>deque</tt>.</p>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.4.1. <tt>capacity</tt> and <tt>reserve</tt> Members</H4>
<p class="docText">The details of how <tt>vector</tt> handles its memory allocation are part of its implementation. However, a portion of this implementation is supported by the interface to <tt>vector</tt>. The <tt>vector</tt> class includes two members, <tt>capacity</tt> and <tt>reserve</tt>, that let us interact with the memory-allocation part of <tt>vector</tt>'s implementation. The <tt>capacity</tt> operation tells us how many elements the container could hold before it must allocate more space. The <tt>reserve</tt> operation lets us tell the <tt>vector</tt> how many elements it should be prepared to hold.</p>

<table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td width="60" valign="top"><img border="0" alt="" align="LEFT" width="50" height="54" SRC="images/0201721481/graphics/note.jpg;400478"></td><TD valign="top"><p class="docText"> It is important to understand the difference between <tt>capacity</tt> and <tt>size</tt>. The <tt>size</tt> is the number of elements in the <tt>vector</tt>; <tt>capacity</tt> is how many it could hold before new space must be allocated.</p></TD></TR></table><br>
</p></div><br>
<p class="docText">To illustrate the interaction between <tt>size</tt> and <tt>capacity</tt>, consider the following program:</P>
<pre>
     vector&lt;int&gt; ivec;

     // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">size should be zero; capacity is implementation defined</span>
     cout &lt;&lt; "ivec: size: " &lt;&lt; ivec.size()
          &lt;&lt; " capacity: "  &lt;&lt; ivec.capacity() &lt;&lt; endl;

     // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">give ivec 24 elements</span>
     for (vector&lt;int&gt;::size_type ix = 0; ix != 24; ++ix)
          ivec.push_back(ix);

     // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">size should be 24; capacity will be &gt;= 24 and is implementation defined</span>
     cout &lt;&lt; "ivec: size: " &lt;&lt; ivec.size()
          &lt;&lt; " capacity: "  &lt;&lt; ivec.capacity() &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">When run on our system, this program produces the following output:</p>
<pre>
     <span class="docEmphStrong">ivec: size: 0 capacity: 0</span>
     <span class="docEmphStrong">ivec: size: 24 capacity: 32</span>
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">We know that the <tt>size</tt> of an empty <tt>vector</tt> is zero, and evidently our library also sets <tt>capacity</tt> of an empty <tt>vector</tt> to zero. When we add elements to the <tt>vector</tt>, we know that the <tt>size</tt> is the same as the number of elements we've added. The <tt>capacity</tt> must be at least as large as <tt>size</tt> but can be larger. Under this implementation, adding 24 elements one at a time results in a <tt>capacity</tt> of 32. Visually we can think of the current state of <tt>ivec</tt> as</p>

<img border="0" alt="" width="470" height="91" SRC="images/0201721481/graphics/332fig01.gif;400478"></p>

<p class="docText">We could now <tt>reserve</tt> some additional space:</P>
<pre>
     ivec.reserve(50);  // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">sets capacity to at least 50; might be more</span>
     // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">size should be 24; capacity will be &gt;= 50 and is implementation defined</span>
     cout &lt;&lt; "ivec: size: " &lt;&lt; ivec.size()
          &lt;&lt; " capacity: "  &lt;&lt; ivec.capacity() &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">As the output indicates, doing so changes the <tt>capacity</tt> but not the <tt>size</tt>:</p>
<pre>
     <span class="docEmphStrong">ivec: size: 24 capacity: 50</span>
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">We might next use up that reserved capacity as follows:</p>
<pre>
     // <span class="docEmphasis">add elements to use up the excess capacity</span>
     while (ivec.size() != ivec.capacity())
          ivec.push_back(0);
     // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">size should be 50; capacity should be unchanged</span>
     cout &lt;&lt; "ivec: size: " &lt;&lt; ivec.size()
          &lt;&lt; " capacity: "  &lt;&lt; ivec.capacity() &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">Because we used only reserved capacity, there is no need for the <tt>vector</tt> to do any allocation. In fact, as long as there is excess capacity, the <tt>vector</tt> must not reallocate its elements.</P>
<p class="docText">The output indicates that at this point we've used up the reserved capacity, and <tt>size</tt> and <tt>capacity</tt> are equal:</p>
<pre>
     <span class="docEmphStrong">ivec: size: 50 capacity: 50</span>
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">If we now add another element, the <tt>vector</tt> will have to reallocate itself:</p>
<pre>
     ivec.push_back(42); // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">add one more element</span>
     // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">size should be 51; capacity will be &gt;= 51 and is implementation defined</span>
     cout &lt;&lt; "ivec: size: " &lt;&lt; ivec.size()
          &lt;&lt; " capacity: "  &lt;&lt; ivec.capacity() &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">The output from this portion of the program</p>
<pre>
     <span class="docEmphStrong">ivec: size: 51 capacity: 100</span>
</pre><br>
<p class="docText"><a name="idd1e70144"></a>indicates that this <tt>vector</tt> implementation appears to follow a strategy of doubling the current capacity each time it has to allocate new storage.</p>
