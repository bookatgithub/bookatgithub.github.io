The containers and algorithms libraries are a cornerstone of the standard library. The library defines more than 100 algorithms. Fortunately, the algorithms have a consistent architecture, which makes learning and using them easier.</P>
<p class="docText">The algorithms are type independent: They generally operate on a sequence of elements that can be stored in a library container type, a built-in array, or even a generated sequence, such as by reading or writing to a stream. Algorithms achieve their type independence by operating in terms of iterators. Most algorithms take a pair of iterators denoting a range of elements as the first two arguments. Additional iterator arguments might include an output iterator denoting a destination, or another iterator or iterator pair denoting a second input sequence.</P>
<p class="docText">Iterators can be categorized by the operations that they support. There are five iterator categories: input, output, forward, bidirectional, and random access. An iterator belongs to a particular category if it supports the operations required for that iterator category.</p>
<p class="docText">Just as iterators are categorized by their operations, iterator parameters to the algorithms are categorized by the iterator operations they require. Algorithms that only read their sequences often require only input iterator operations. Those that write to a destination iterator often require only the actions of an output iterator, and so on.</P>
<p class="docText">Algorithms that look for a value often have a second version that looks for an element for which a predicate returns a nonzero value. For such algorithms, the name of the second version has the suffix <tt>_if</tt>. Similarly, many algorithms provide so-called copying versions. These write the (transformed) elements to an output sequence rather than writing back into the input range. Such versions have names that end with <tt>_copy</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText">A third pattern is whether algorithms read, write, or reorder elements. Algorithms <span class="docEmphasis">never</span> directly change the size of the sequences on which they operate. (If an argument is an insert iterator, then that iterator might add elements, but the algorithm does not do so directly.) They may copy elements from one position to another but cannot directly add or remove elements.</p>
