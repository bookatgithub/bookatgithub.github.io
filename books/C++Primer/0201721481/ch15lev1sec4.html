<p class="docText">The fact that each derived object consists of the (non<tt>static)</tt> members defined in the derived class plus one or more base-class subobjects affects how derived-type objects are constructed, copied, assigned, and destroyed. When we construct, copy, assign, or destroy an object of derived type, we also construct, copy, assign, or destroy those base-class subobjects.</P>
<p class="docText">Constructors and the copy-control members are not inherited; each class defines its own constructor(s) and copy-control members. As is the case for any class, synthesized versions of the default constructor and the copy-control members will be used if the class does not define its own versions.</P>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">15.4.1. Base-Class Constructors and Copy Control</H4>
<p class="docText">Constructors and copy control for base classes that are not themselves a derived class are largely unaffected by inheritance. Our <tt>Item_base</tt> constructor looks like many we've seen before:</p>

The base part is initialized by the default constructor of the base class.</p>
<p class="docText">For our <tt>Bulk_item</tt> class, the synthesized default constructor would execute as follows:</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">Defining a Default Constructor</H5>

<p class="docText">The constructor initializer list for a derived-class constructor may initialize only the members of the derived class; it may not directly initialize its inherited members.

<h5 class="docSection3Title">Only an Immediate Base Class May Be Initialized</H5>
<p class="docText">A class may initialize only its own immediate base class. An immediate base class is the class named in the derivation list. If class <tt>C</tt> is derived from class <tt>B</tt>, which is derived from class <tt>A</tt>, then <tt>B</tt> is the immediate base of <tt>C</tt>. Even though every <tt>C</tt> object contains an <tt>A</tt> part, the constructors for <tt>C</tt> may not initialize the <tt>A</tt> part directly. Instead, class <tt>C</tt> initializes <tt>B</tt>, and the constructor for class <tt>B</tt> in turn initializes <tt>A</tt>. The reason for this restriction is that the author of class <tt>B</tt> has specified how to construct and initialize objects of type <tt>B</tt>. As with any user of class <tt>B</tt>, the author of class <tt>C</tt> has no right to change that specification.</p>
<p class="docText">As a more concrete example, our bookstore might have several discount strategies. In addition to a bulk discount, it might offer a discount for purchases up to a certain quantity and then charge the full price thereafter. Or it might offer a discount for purchases above a certain limit but not for purchases up to that limit.</p>
<p class="docText">Each of these discount strategies is the same in that it requires a quantity and a discount amount. We might support these differing strategies by defining a new class named <tt>Disc_item</tt> to store the quantity and the discount amount. This class would not define a <tt>net_price</tt> function but would serve as a base class for classes such as <tt>Bulk_item</tt> that define the different discount strategies.</P>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">The reason that a constructor can initialize only its immediate base class is that each class defines its own interface.

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">For similar reasons, derived-class constructors may not initialize and should not assign to the members of its base class. When those members are <tt>public</tt> or <tt>protected</tt>, a derived constructor could assign values to its base class members inside the constructor body. However, doing so would violate the interface of the base.

Once that operator finishes, we continue doing whatever is needed to assign the members in the derived class.</p>

<h5 class="docSection3Title">Derived-Class Destructor</h5>
<p class="docText">The destructor works differently from the copy constructor and assignment operator: The derived destructor is never responsible for destroying the members of its base objects. The compiler always implicitly invokes the destructor for the base part of a derived object. Each destructor does only what is necessary to clean up its own members:</p>
<pre>
     class Derived: public Base {
     public:
         // <span class="docEmphasis">Base::~Base</span> <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">invoked automatically</span>
         ~Derived()    { /* <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">do what it takes to clean up derived members</span> */ }
      };
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText">Objects are destroyed in the opposite order from which they are constructed: The derived destructor is run first, and then the base-class destructors are invoked, walking back up the inheritance hierarchy.</p>


<a name="ch15lev2sec15"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.4.4. Virtual Destructors</H4>
<p class="docText">The fact that destructors for the base parts are invoked automatically has an important consequence for the design of base classes.</p>
<p class="docText">When we <tt>delete</tt> a pointer that points to a dynamically allocated object, the destructor is run to clean up the object before the memory for that object is freed. When dealing with objects in an inheritance hierarchy, it is possible that the static type of the pointer might differ from the dynamic type of the object that is being deleted. We might <tt>delete</tt> a pointer to the base type that actually points to a derived object.</p>
<p class="docText">If we <tt>delete</tt> a pointer to base, then the base-class destructor is run and the members of the base are cleaned up. If the object really is a derived type, then the behavior is undefined. To ensure that the proper destructor is run, the destructor must be virtual in the base class:</p>
<pre>
     class Item_base {
     public:
         // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">no work, but virtual destructor needed</span>
         // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">if base pointer that points to a derived object is ever deleted</span>
         virtual ~Item_base() { }
     };
</pre><BR>
<p class="docText"><a name="idd1e117183"></a><a name="idd1e117193"></a><a name="idd1e117201"></a><a name="idd1e117206"></a><a name="idd1e117213"></a><a name="idd1e117218"></a><a name="idd1e117225"></a><a name="idd1e117232"></a><a name="idd1e117239"></a><a name="idd1e117244"></a><a name="idd1e117249"></a><a name="idd1e117254"></a>If the destructor is virtual, then when it is invoked through a pointer, which destructor is run will vary depending on the type of the object to which the pointer points:</P>
<pre>
     Item_base *itemP = new Item_base; // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">same static and dynamic type</span>
     delete itemP;          // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">ok: destructor for</span> <span class="docEmphasis">Item_base</span> <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">called</span>
     itemP = new Bulk_item; // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">ok: static and dynamic types differ</span>
     delete itemP;          // <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">ok: destructor for</span> <span class="docEmphasis">Bulk_item</span> <span class="docEmphItalicAlt">called</span>
</pre><br>
<p class="docText">Like other virtual functions, the virtual nature of the destructor is inherited. Therefore, if the destructor in the root class of the hierarchy is virtual, then the derived destructors will be virtual as well. A derived destructor will be virtual whether the class explicitly defines its destructor or uses the synthesized destructor.</p>
<p class="docText">Destructors for base classes are an important exception to the Rule of Three (<a class="docLink" href="ch13lev1sec3.html#ch13lev1sec3">Section 13.3</a>, p. <a class="docLink" href="ch13lev1sec3.html#ch13lev1sec3">485</a>). That rule says that if a class needs a destructor, then the class almost surely needs the other copy-control members. A base class almost always needs a destructor so that it can make the destructor virtual. If a base class has an empty destructor in order to make it virtual, then the fact that the class has a destructor is not an indication that the assignment operator or copy constructor is also needed.</p>

<h5 class="docSection3Title">Constructors and Assignment Are Not Virtual</h5>
<p class="docText">Of the copy-control members, only the destructor should be defined as virtual. Constructors cannot be defined as virtual. Constructors are run before the object is fully constructed. While the constructor is running, the object's dynamic type is not complete.</p>
<p class="docText">Although we can define a virtual <tt>operator=</tt> member function in the base class, doing so does not affect the assignment operators used in the derived classes. Each class has its own assignment operator. The assignment operator in a derived class has a parameter that has the same type as the class itself. That type must differ from the parameter type for the assignment operator in any other class in the hierarchy.</p>
<p class="docText">Making the assignment operator virtual is likely to be confusing because a virtual function must have the same parameter type in base and derived classes. The base-class assignment operator has a parameter that is a reference to its own class type. If that operator is virtual, then each class gets a virtual member that defines an <tt>operator=</tt> that takes a base object. But this operator is not the same as the assignment operator for the derived class.</p>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.4.5. Virtuals in Constructors and Destructors</H4>
<p class="docText">A derived object is constructed by first running a base-class constructor to initialize the base part of the object. While the base-class constructor is executing, the derived part of the object is uninitialized. In effect, the object is not yet a derived object.</p>
<p class="docText">When a derived object is destroyed, its derived part is destroyed first, and then its base parts are destroyed in the reverse order of how they were constructed.</P>
<p class="docText">In both cases, while a constructor or destructor is running, the object is incomplete. To accommodate this incompleteness, the compiler treats the object as if its type changes during construction or destruction. Inside a base-class constructor or destructor, a derived object is treated as if it were an object of the base type.</p>
<p class="docText">The type of an object during construction and destruction affects the binding of virtual functions.</p>
<a name="ch15note22"></a><div class="docNote"><P>
<table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><TR><td width="60" valign="top"><img border="0" alt="" align="LEFT" width="50" height="54" SRC="images/0201721481/graphics/note.jpg;400478"></td><td valign="top"><p class="docText"> If a virtual is called from inside a constructor or destructor, then the version that is run is the one defined for the type of the constructor or destructor itself.</p></td></TR></table><br>
</P></div><BR>
<p class="docText">This binding applies to a virtual whether the virtual is called directly by the constructor (or destructor) or is called indirectly from a function that the constructor (or destructor) called.</p>
<p class="docText">To understand this behavior, consider what would happen if the derived-class version of a virtual function were called from a base-class constructor (or destructor). The derived version of the virtual probably accesses members of the derived <a name="idd1e117497"></a><a name="idd1e117502"></a><a name="idd1e117507"></a><a name="idd1e117512"></a><a name="idd1e117517"></a><a name="idd1e117522"></a><a name="idd1e117527"></a><a name="idd1e117532"></a><a name="idd1e117537"></a>object. After all, if the derived-class version didn't need to use members from the derived object, the derived class could probably use the definition from the base class. However, the members of the derived part of the object aren't initialized while the base constructor (or destructor) is running. In practice, if such access were allowed, the program would probably crash.</p>
