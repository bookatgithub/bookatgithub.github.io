<p class="docText"><a name="idd1e153864"></a><a name="idd1e153868"></a><a name="idd1e153871"></a><a name="idd1e153874"></a>C++ provides several specialized facilities that are tailored to particular kinds of problems.</P>
<p class="docText">Customized memory management is used by classes in two ways: A class may need to define its own internal memory allocation that allows it to streamline allocation of its own data members. A class might want to define its own, class-specific <tt>operator new</tt> and <tt>operator delete</tt> functions that will be used whenever new objects of the class type are allocated.</P>
<p class="docText">Some programs need to directly interrogate the dynamic type of an object at run time. Run-time type identification (RTTI) provides language level support for this kind of programming. RTTI applies only to classes that define virtual functions; type information for types that do not define virtual functions is available but reflects the static type.</p>
<p class="docText">Pointers to ordinary objects are typed. When we define a pointer to a class member, the pointer type must also encapsulate the type of the class to which the pointer points. A pointer to member may be bound to any member of the class that has the same type. When we dereference a pointer to member, an object from which to fetch the member must be specified.</P>
<p class="docText">C++ defines several additional aggregate types:</p>
<ul><LI><p class="docList">Nested classes, which are classes defined in the scope of another class. Such classes are often defined as implementation classes of its enclosing class.</P></li><li><p class="docList">Unions are a special kind of class that may contain only simple data members. An object of a <tt>union</tt> type may define a value for only one of its data members at any one time. Unions are most often nested inside another class type.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Local classes, which are very simple classes defined local to a function. All members of a local class must be defined in the class body. There are no static data members of a local class.</P></li></UL>
<p class="docText">C++ also supports several inherently nonportable features including bit-fields and <tt>volatile</tt>, which make it easier to interface to hardware, and linkage directives, which make it easier to interface to programs written in other langauges.</P>
