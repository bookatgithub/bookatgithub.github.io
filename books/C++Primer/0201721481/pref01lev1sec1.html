<h3 class="docSection1Title">Changes to the Fourth Edition</h3>
<p class="docText">In this edition, we have completely reorganized and rewritten the <span class="docEmphasis">C++ Primer</span> to highlight modern styles of C++ programming. This edition gives center stage to using the standard library while deemphasizing techniques for low-level programming. We introduce the standard library much earlier in the text and have reformulated the examples to take advantage of library facilities. We have also streamlined and reordered the presentation of language topics.</P>
<p class="docText">In addition to restructuring the text, we have incorporated several new elements to enhance the reader's understanding. Each chapter concludes with a Chapter Summary and glossary of Defined Terms, which recap the chapter's most important points. Readers should use these sections as a personal checklist: If you do not understand a term, restudy the corresponding part of the chapter.</P>
<p class="docText">We've also incorporated a number of other learning aids in the body of the text:</p>
<UL><li><p class="docList">Important terms are indicated in <span class="docEmphStrong">bold</span>; important terms that we assume are already familiar to the reader are indicated in <span class="docEmphBoldItalic">bold italics</span>. Each term appears in the chapter's Defined Terms section.</p></LI><LI><p class="docList">Throughout the book, we highlight parts of the text to call attention to important aspects of the language, warn about common pitfalls, suggest good programming practices, and provide general usage tips. We hope that these notes will help readers more quickly digest important concepts and avoid common pitfalls.</p></li><li><p class="docList">To make it easier to follow the relationships among features and concepts, we provide extensive forward and backward cross-references.</p></li><LI><p class="docList">We have provided sidebar discussions that focus on important concepts and supply additional explanations for topics that programmers new to C++ often find most difficult.</p></LI><LI><p class="docList">Learning any programming language requires writing programs. To that end, the primer provides extensive examples throughout the text. Source code for the extended examples is available on the Web at the following URL:</p><p class="docList"><a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.awprofessional.com/cpp_primer">http://www.awprofessional.com/cpp_primer</a></p></li></UL>
<p class="docText">What hasn't changed from earlier versions is that the book remains a comprehensive tutorial introduction to C++. Our intent is to provide a clear, complete and correct guide to the language. We teach the language by presenting a series of examples, which, in addition to explaining language features, show how to make the best use of C++. Although knowledge of C (the language on which C++ was originally based) is not assumed, we do assume the reader has programmed in a modern block-structured language.</P>
