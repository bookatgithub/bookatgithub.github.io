<h3 class="docSection1Title">Structure of This Book</h3>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">C++ Primer</span> provides an introduction to the International Standard on C++, covering both the language proper and the extensive library that is part of that standard. Much of the power of C++ comes from its support for programming with abstractions. Learning to program effectively in C++ requires more than learning new syntax and semantics. Our focus is on how to use the features of C++ to write programs that are safe, that can be built quickly, and yet offer performance comparable to the sorts of low-level programs often written in C.</P>
<p class="docText">C++ is a large language and can be daunting to new users. Modern C++ can be thought of as comprising three parts:</P>
<ul><LI><p class="docList">The low-level language, largely inherited from C</p></li><LI><p class="docList">More advanced language features that allow us to define our own data types and to organize large-scale programs and systems</P></li><li><p class="docList">The standard library, which uses these advanced features to provide a set of useful data structures and algorithms</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">Most texts present C++ in this same order: They start by covering the low-level details and then introduce the the more advanced language features. They explain the standard library only after having covered the entire language. The result, all too often, is that readers get bogged down in issues of low-level programming or the complexities of writing type definitions and never really understand the power of programming in a more abstract way. Needless to say, readers also often do not learn enough to build their own abstractions.</P>
<p class="docText">In this edition we take a completely different tack. We start by covering the basics of the language and the library together. Doing so allows you, the reader, to write significant programs. Only after a thorough grounding in using the library and writing the kinds of abstract programs that the libary allowsdo we move on to those features of C++ that will enable you to write your own abstractions.</p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="part01.html#part01">Parts I</a> and <a class="docLink" href="part02.html#part02">II</a> cover the basic language and library facilities. The focus of these parts is to learn how to write C++ programs and how to use the abstractions from the library. Most C++ programmers need to know essentially everything covered in this portion of the book.</P>
<p class="docText">In addition to teaching the basics of C++, the material in <a class="docLink" href="part01.html#part01">Parts I</a> and <a class="docLink" href="part02.html#part02">II</a> serves another important purpose. The library facilities are themselves abstract data types written in C++. The library can be defined using the same class-construction features that are available to any C++ programmer. Our experience in teaching C++ is that by first using well-designed abstract types, readers find it easier to understand how to build their own types.</P>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="part03.html#part03">Parts III</a> through <a class="docLink" href="part05.html#part05">V</a> focus on how we can write our own types. <a class="docLink" href="part03.html#part03">Part III</a> introduces the heart of C++: its support for classes. The class mechanism provides the basis for writing our own abstractions. Classes are also the foundation for object-oriented and generic programming, which we cover in <a class="docLink" href="part04.html#part04">Part IV</a>. The <span class="docEmphasis">Primer</span> concludes with <a class="docLink" href="part05.html#part05">Part V</a>, which covers advanced features that are of most use in structuring large, complex systems.</p>
