<h3 class="docSection1Title">Acknowledgments</h3>
<p class="docText">As in previous editions of this <span class="docEmphasis">Primer</span>, we'd like to extend our thanks to Bjarne Stroustrup for his tireless work on C++ and for his friendship to these authors throughout most of that time. We'd also like to thank Alex Stepanov for his original insights that led to the containers and algorithms that form the core of the standard library. Finally, our thanks go to the C++ Standards committee members for their hard work in clarifying, refining, and improving C++ over many years.</P>
<p class="docText">We also extend our deep-felt thanks to our reviewers, whose helpful comments on multiple drafts led us to make improvements great and small throughout the book: Paul Abrahams, Michael Ball, Mary Dageforde, Paul DuBois, Matt Greenwood, Matthew P. Johnson, Andrew Koenig, Nevin Liber, Bill Locke, Robert Murray, Phil Romanik, Justin Shaw, Victor Shtern, Clovis Tondo, Daveed Vandevoorde, and Steve Vinoski.</P>
<p class="docText">This book was typeset using LATEX and the many packages that accompany the LATEX distribution. Our well-justified thanks go to the members of the LATEX community, who have made available such powerful typesetting tools.</p>
<p class="docText">The examples in this book have been compiled on the GNU and Microsoft compilers. Our thanks to their developers, and to those who have developed all the other C++ compilers, thereby making C++ a reality.</P>
<p class="docText">Finally, we thank the fine folks at Addison-Wesley who have shepherded this edition through the publishing process: Debbie Lafferty, our original editor, who initiated this edition and who had been with the <span class="docEmphasis">Primer</span> from its very first edition; Peter Gordon, our new editor, whose insistence on updating and streamlining the text have, we hope, greatly improved the presentation; Kim Boedigheimer, who keeps us all on schedule; and Tyrrell Albaugh, Jim Markham, Elizabeth Ryan, and John Fuller, who saw us through the design and production process.</p>
