<p class="docText"><a name="The Qt"></a>&#84;he Qt f&#114;amewo&#114;k firs&#116; became publicly available in &#77;ay 1995. It was initially developed by H&#97;avard Nor&#100; (T&#114;ollte&#99;h's CEO) and Eirik Cha&#109;be-Eng (Troll&#116;ech's Chief T&#114;oll). Haavard and E&#105;rik met at the Norwegian Institu&#116;e of Technology in Trondheim, &#119;here they both graduated with master's degrees in computer sci&#101;nce.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="GUI development"></a>Haavard's interest in C++ GUI development beg&#97;n in 1988 when h&#101; wa&#115; commis&#115;ioned by a Swedish compa&#110;y to develop a C++ GUI frame&#119;ork. A couple &#111;f y&#101;ar&#115; later, in t&#104;e summ&#101;r of 1990, Haa&#118;ard and Eirik were w&#111;rking together on a C++ da&#116;abase application for ultrasound images. The sys&#116;em needed to be able to run with a GUI on Uni&#120;, Macintosh, and Windows. One day that summer, H&#97;avard and &#69;irik went ou&#116;side to e&#110;joy the suns&#104;ine, and as they sat on a park &#98;ench, Haava&#114;d said, &quot;&#87;e need an o&#98;ject-oriented displ&#97;y system&quot;. T&#104;e resulting discu&#115;sion laid the in&#116;ellectual foundation for the obje&#99;t-oriented cross-platform GUI framewo&#114;k they would soon go on to build.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="Haavard started"></a>In 1991, Haavard star&#116;ed writing the classes that eventually beca&#109;e Qt, collabo&#114;ating &#119;ith Eirik on &#116;he design. The foll&#111;wing year, Eirik &#99;ame up with t&#104;e idea &#102;or &quot;s&#105;gnals and &#115;lots&quot;, a s&#105;mple but powerfu&#108; GUI programming paradi&#103;m that has now been emb&#114;aced by several other toolkits. Haav&#97;rd took the idea and produced a hand-&#99;oded implementation. By 1993, Haavard and Eirik had developed Qt's &#102;irs&#116; graphic&#115; kernel &#97;nd were able to implement &#116;heir own widgets. At the end o&#102; the &#121;ea&#114;, Haava&#114;d suggest&#101;d t&#104;at they go &#105;nto business to&#103;ether to build &quot;the world's best C++ G&#85;I framework&quot;.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="wanting to"></a>The year 1994 began inauspicious&#108;y with the two young programmers wanting to enter a well-&#101;stablished market, with no customers, an unfinished p&#114;oduct, &#97;nd no mone&#121;. Fo&#114;tunately, their wiv&#101;s were employed and th&#101;re&#102;ore &#97;ble to sup&#112;ort their hus&#98;ands for th&#101; two ye&#97;rs Eirik and &#72;aavard expected to ne&#101;d to develop the product and start e&#97;rning an income.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="the class"></a>The letter 'Q' was chosen a&#115; the class prefix because the letter looked b&#101;au&#116;iful in H&#97;avard's Em&#97;cs font. The 't' was added to &#115;tand for &quot;toolkit&quot;, inspired by X&#116;, the X Too&#108;kit. The com&#112;any &#119;as incorporated on Mar&#99;h 4, 1994, originall&#121; as Qua&#115;ar Techno&#108;ogies, then as Troll Tech, and today as Trollt&#101;ch.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="of Haavard"></a>In April 1995, thanks to a contact made &#116;hrough one of Haavard's university pr&#111;fessors, the Norwegian company Metis g&#97;ve them a c&#111;nt&#114;act to &#100;evelop software based o&#110; Qt. Around this time, Tr&#111;ll&#116;ech hire&#100; A&#114;nt Gulbrandsen, wh&#111; du&#114;ing his six yea&#114;s at Troll&#116;ech devised and implemented an i&#110;genious documentation &#115;ystem as well as contributing to Qt's code.</p>
<p class="docText">On May 20, 1995, Qt 0.90 was u&#112;loaded to <tt>sunsite.unc.edu</tt><a name="on"></a>. &#83;ix da&#121;s l&#97;ter, the re&#108;ease was announced on <tt>co&#109;p.os.linux.announce</tt><a name="for both"></a>. This was Qt's firs&#116; public r&#101;le&#97;se. Qt coul&#100; be us&#101;d f&#111;r both &#87;indows and U&#110;ix development, off&#101;ring the same API on b&#111;th platforms. Qt was available unde&#114; two licenses from day one: A commercial license was requir&#101;d f&#111;r c&#111;mm&#101;rcial development, and &#97; free software edition was available fo&#114; open s&#111;ur&#99;e developme&#110;t. The Met&#105;s contr&#97;ct kept Troll&#116;ech afloat, while fo&#114; ten long months no one bought a com&#109;ercial Qt license.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="March "></a>In March 1996, the European Space &#65;gency became the second Qt customer, with a purch&#97;se of ten commercial licenses. With unwa&#118;ering fait&#104;, Eirik &#97;nd Haavar&#100; hired another deve&#108;oper. Qt 0.97 was released at the end o&#102; May, &#97;nd on Sept&#101;mb&#101;r 24, 1996, Qt 1.0 came out. &#66;y the end &#111;f the year, &#81;t had reached &#118;ersion 1.1; eight customers, each &#105;n a different country, had boug&#104;t 18 licenses between them. This &#121;ear also saw the founding of the KDE p&#114;oject, &#108;ed by Matth&#105;as Ettr&#105;ch.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="to build"></a>Qt 1.2 was released i&#110; April 1997. Matthias Ettrich's d&#101;ci&#115;ion to u&#115;e Qt to b&#117;ild KDE helped Qt beco&#109;e the de fact&#111; standard for &#67;++ GUI developm&#101;nt on Linux. Qt 1.3 was release&#100; in September 1997.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="Matthias joined"></a>M&#97;tthias joined Trolltech in 1998, and the last major Qt 1 rele&#97;se, 1.40, was made in September of that year. Qt 2.0 was release&#100; i&#110; J&#117;ne 1999. Qt 2 had a &#110;ew open source license, the &#81; Public License (QPL), which co&#109;plied with t&#104;e Open &#83;ourc&#101; Defini&#116;ion. In Au&#103;ust 1999, Qt won the L&#105;nuxWorld award for &#98;est library/tool. Around t&#104;is time, Trolltech Pty Ltd (Austra&#108;ia) was established.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="Linux in"></a>Trolltech released Qt/Embedded L&#105;nux in 2000. It was designed to run on embedded Linu&#120; d&#101;vi&#99;es and provi&#100;ed its own win&#100;ow system as a lightweight re&#112;lac&#101;me&#110;t &#102;or X11. Both Qt/X11 a&#110;d &#81;t/Embedded Linu&#120; were &#110;ow offered under the wide&#108;y used GNU General Public License (GPL) &#97;s well as under commercial lice&#110;ses. By the end of 2000, Trolltech had e&#115;tablis&#104;ed Tro&#108;ltech Inc. (U&#83;A) and had releas&#101;d the first version of Q&#116;opia, an a&#112;pli&#99;ation platf&#111;rm for m&#111;bi&#108;e phones and P&#68;As. Qt/Embedde&#100; Linux won the LinuxWorld &quot;Best &#69;mbedded Linux Solution&quot; award in both 2001 and 2002, &#97;nd Qtopia Phone achieved the same di&#115;tinction in 2004.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="was released"></a>Qt 3.0 was released in 2001. Qt was now available on Win&#100;o&#119;s, Mac OS X, Uni&#120;, a&#110;d Linux (desktop and em&#98;edded). Qt 3 provided 42 n&#101;w c&#108;asses and i&#116;s code ex&#99;eeded 500000 lines. Qt 3 w&#97;s a major s&#116;ep forward from &#81;t 2, inc&#108;uding considerably improv&#101;d locale and Unicode support, &#97; completely new text viewing and editing widg&#101;t, and a Perl-like regular expression class. Qt 3 won t&#104;e Soft&#119;are Develop&#109;ent Times &quot;Jo&#108;t Productivity Award&quot; in 2002.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="and more"></a>I&#110; the summer of 2005, Qt 4.0 w&#97;s release&#100;. W&#105;th abou&#116; 500 classes and more th&#97;n 9000 functio&#110;s, Qt 4 i&#115; larger and richer &#116;han any previous version, a&#110;d it has been split into sev&#101;ral libraries so that developers only ne&#101;d to link against the parts of Qt that the&#121; ne&#101;d. Q&#116; 4 is a huge &#97;dvance on previous ver&#115;ions with improvement&#115; that in&#99;lude a compl&#101;te&#108;y new set of eff&#105;cient a&#110;d eas&#121;-to-use templa&#116;e containers, advanc&#101;d model/view functionality, a f&#97;st and flexible 2D painting framewo&#114;k, and powerful Unicode text viewing and edi&#116;ing clas&#115;es, not t&#111; me&#110;tion thousands of &#115;maller enhancements across the &#99;omplete ran&#103;e of Q&#116; classes. &#81;t 4's feat&#117;re set is n&#111;w so br&#111;ad that it ha&#115; taken Qt beyond being a GUI &#116;oolkit and made it into a full-blown appli&#99;ation development framework. Qt 4 is &#97;lso the first Qt edition to be available for both &#99;ommercial a&#110;d &#111;pe&#110; source developme&#110;t on all the platform&#115; it supp&#111;rt&#115;.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="representative office"></a>Also in 2005, &#84;rolltech &#111;pe&#110;ed a &#114;epresent&#97;tive office in Beijing to provide cu&#115;tomers in China and the region with sales se&#114;vices, training, and technical support for Qt/Embedde&#100; Linux and Qtopia.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="availability of"></a>Qt has long been available to non-C++ p&#114;ogram&#109;ers through &#116;he avail&#97;bility of unofficial language b&#105;ndings, in particular PyQt for Pytho&#110; p&#114;ogram&#109;ers. In 2007, the Qy&#111;to unofficia&#108; bindings w&#101;re releas&#101;d for C# &#112;rogrammers. Also in 2007, Trollt&#101;ch launched Qt Jambi, an offic&#105;ally supported Java version of the Qt &#65;PI. <a class="docLink" href="app03.html#app03">Appendix C</a> provides an introduction to Qt Jambi.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="continues to"></a>Since Tro&#108;ltech's bir&#116;h, Qt's pop&#117;larity ha&#115; grown unabated and co&#110;tinues to grow to th&#105;s day. Th&#105;s succe&#115;s is a re&#102;lection both &#111;f t&#104;e quality of Qt &#97;nd of how enj&#111;yable it is to use. In the past &#100;ecade, Qt has gone from being a prod&#117;ct used by a select few &quot;in the know&quot; to one that is used d&#97;ily by thousands of customers and tens of thousands of ope&#110; s&#111;ur&#99;e developer&#115; all around the world.</p>
