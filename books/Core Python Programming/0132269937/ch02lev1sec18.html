<p class="docText">Classes are a core part of object-oriented programming and serve as a &quot;container&quot; for related data and logic. They provide a &quot;blueprint&quot; for creating &quot;real&quot; objects, called <span class="docEmphasis">instances</span>. Because Python does not require you to program in an object-oriented way (like Java does), classes are not required learning at this time. However, we will present some examples here for those who are interested in getting a sneak peek.</p>

     method_declarations</span></pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">Classes are declared using the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>class</tt></span> keyword. A base or parent class is optional; if you do not have one, just use <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>object</tt></span> as the base class. This header line is followed by an optional documentation string, static member declarations, and any method declarations.</P>

<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1380"></a><a name="iddle2419"></a><a name="iddle2462"></a><a name="iddle2464"></a><a name="iddle3709"></a>In the above class, we declared one static data type variable <tt>version</tt> shared among all instances and four methods, <tt>__init__()</tt>, <tt>showname()</tt>, <tt>showver()</tt>, and the familiar <tt>addMe2Me()</tt>. The <tt>show*()</tt> methods do not really do much but output the data they were created to output. The <tt>__init__()</tt> method has a special name, as do all those whose names begin and end with a double underscore ( __ ).</p>
<p class="docText">The <tt>__init__()</tt> method is a function provided by default that is called when a class instance is created, similar to a constructor and called after the object has been instantiated. <tt>__init__()</tt> can be thought of as a constructor, but unlike constructors in other languages, it does not create an instanceit is really just the first method that is called after your object has been created.</p>
<p class="docText">Its purpose is to perform any other type of &quot;start up&quot; necessary for the instance to take on a life of its own. By creating our own <tt>__init__()</tt> method, we override the default method (which does not do anything) so that we can do customization and other &quot;extra things&quot; when our instance is created. In our case, we initialize a class instance attribute or member called <tt>name</tt>. This variable is associated only with class instances and is not part of the actual class itself. __<tt>init</tt>__<tt>()</tt> also features a default argument, introduced in the previous section. You will no doubt also notice the one argument which is part of every method, <tt>self</tt>.</P>
<p class="docText">What is <tt>self</tt>? It is basically an instance's handle to itself, the instance on which a method was called. Other OO languages often use an identifier called <tt>this</tt>.</p>

<H4 id="title-IDAK1SOC" class="docSection2Title">How to Create Class Instances</h4>
<div class="docText"><pre>  &gt;&gt;&gt; foo1 = FooClass()
  Created a class instance for John Doe</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1291"></a><a name="iddle2375"></a><a name="iddle2932"></a><a name="iddle2935"></a><a name="iddle2939"></a><a name="iddle3819"></a><a name="iddle4433"></a>The string that is displayed is a result of a call to the <tt>__init__()</tt> method which we did not explicitly have to make. When an instance is created, <tt>__init__()</tt> is automatically called, whether we provided our own or the interpreter used the default one.</p>
<p class="docText">Creating instances looks just like calling a function and has the exact same syntax. They are both known as &quot;callables.&quot; Class instantiation uses the same functional operator as invoking a function or method.</P>
<p class="docText">Now that we have successfully created our first class instance, we can make some method calls, too:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>   &gt;&gt;&gt; foo1.showname()
   Your name is John Doe
   My name is __main__.FooClass
   &gt;&gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; foo1.showver()
   0.1
   &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> foo1.addMe2Me(5)
   10
   &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> foo1.addMe2Me('xyz')
   xyzxyz</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">The result of each function call is as we expected. One interesting piece of data is the class name. In the <tt>showname()</tt> method, we displayed the <tt>self.__class__.__name__</tt> variable which, for an instance, represents the name of the class from which it has been instantiated. (<tt>self.__class__</tt> refers to the actual class.) In our example, we did not pass in a name to create our instance, so the <tt>'John Doe'</tt> default argument was used. In our next example, we do not use it.</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>   &gt;&gt;&gt; foo2 = FooClass('Jane Smith')
   Created a class instance for Jane Smith
   &gt;&gt;&gt; foo2.showname()
   Your name is Jane Smith
   My name is FooClass</pre></div><br>
