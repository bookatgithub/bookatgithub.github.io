<h3 id="title-IDAOZ0KN" class="docSection1Title">3.5. Memory Management</H3>
<p class="docText">So far you have seen a large number of Python code samples. We are going to cover a few more details about variables and memory management in this section, including:</p>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">Variables not declared ahead of time</P></LI><li><p class="docList">Variable types not declared</p></li><LI><p class="docList">No memory management on programmers' part</p></LI><li><p class="docList">Variable names can be &quot;recycled&quot;</P></li><LI><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>del</tt></span> statement allows for explicit &quot;deallocation&quot;</P></li></ul>

<h4 id="title-IDAR00KN" class="docSection2Title">3.5.1. Variable Declarations (or Lack Thereof)</h4>
<p class="docText">In most compiled languages, variables must be declared before they are used. In fact, C is even more restrictive: variables have to be declared at the beginning of a code block and before any statements are given. Other languages, like C++ and Java, allow &quot;on-the-fly&quot; declarations, i.e., those which occur in the middle of a body of codebut these name and type declarations are still required before the variables can be used. In Python, there are no explicit variable declarations. Variables are &quot;declared&quot; on first assignment. Like most languages, however, variables cannot be accessed until they are (created and) assigned:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>  &gt;&gt;&gt; a
  Traceback (innermost last):
    File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  NameError: a</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Once a variable has been assigned, you can access it by using its name:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>  &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 4
  &gt;&gt;&gt; y = 'this is a string'
  &gt;&gt;&gt; x
  4
  &gt;&gt;&gt; y
  'this is a string'</pre></div><BR>

<h4 id="title-IDAS10KN" class="docSection2Title">3.5.2. Dynamic Typing</h4>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1777"></a><a name="iddle2835"></a><a name="iddle2838"></a><a name="iddle2839"></a><a name="iddle3569"></a><a name="iddle3573"></a><a name="iddle4313"></a>Another observation, in addition to lack of variable declaration, is the lack of type specification. In Python, the type and memory space for an object are determined and allocated at runtime. Although code is byte-compiled, Python is still an interpreted language. On creationthat is, on assignmentthe interpreter creates an object whose type is dictated by the syntax that is used for the operand on the right-hand side of an assignment. After the object is created, a reference to that object is assigned to the variable on the left-hand side of the assignment.</p>

<a name="ch03lev2sec20"></a>
<H4 id="title-IDAI30KN" class="docSection2Title">3.5.3. Memory Allocation</H4>
<p class="docText">As responsible programmers, we are aware that when allocating memory space for variables, we are borrowing system resources, and eventually, we will have to return that which we borrowed back to the system. Python simplifies application writing because the complexities of memory management have been pushed down to the interpreter. The belief is that you should be using Python to solve problems with and not have to worry about lower-level issues that are not directly related to your solution.</p>

<a name="ch03lev2sec21"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAU30KN" class="docSection2Title">3.5.4. Reference Counting</h4>
<p class="docText">To keep track of objects in memory, Python uses the simple technique of <span class="docEmphasis">reference counting</span>. This means that internally, Python keeps track of all objects in use and how many interested parties there are for any particular object. You can think of it as simple as card-counting while playing the card game blackjack or 21. An internal tracking variable, called a <span class="docEmphasis">reference counter</span>, keeps track of how many references are being made to each object, called a <span class="docEmphasis">refcount</span> for short.</p>
<p class="docText">When an object is created, a reference is made to that object, and when it is no longer needed, i.e., when an object's refcount goes down to zero, it is garbage-collected. (This is not 100 percent true, but pretend it is for now.)</p>
<a name="ch03lev3sec1"></a>
<h5 id="title-IDAI40KN" class="docSection3Title">Incrementing the Reference Count</h5>
<p class="docText">The refcount for an object is initially set to 1 when an object is created and (its reference) assigned.</p>
<p class="docText">New references to objects, also called <span class="docEmphasis">aliases</span>, occur when additional variables are assigned to the same object, passed as arguments to invoke other bodies of code such as functions, methods, or class instantiation, or assigned as members of a sequence or mapping.</p>
<p class="docText">Let us say we make the following declarations:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>   x = 3.14
   y = x</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">The statement <tt>x = 3.14</tt> allocates a floating point number (float) object and assigns a reference <tt>x</tt> to it. <tt>x</tt> is the first reference, hence setting that object's refcount to one. The statement <tt>y = x</tt> creates an alias <tt>y</tt>, which &quot;points to&quot; the same integer object as <tt>x</tt> (see <a class="docLink" href="#ch03fig02">Figure 3-2</a>). A new object is <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> created for <tt>y</tt>.</p>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" width="200" height="83" SRC="images/chun_fig03_02.jpg"></p>


</center></P><br>
<p class="docText">Instead, the only thing that happens is that the reference count for this object is incremented by one (to 2). This is one way in which an object's refcount goes up. Other ways it can increment include the object being passed into a function call, and when the object is added to a container object such as a list.</P>
<p class="docText">In summary, an object's refcount is increased when</p>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">It (the object) is created</P><div class="docText"><pre>    x = 3.14</pre></div></LI><li><p class="docList">Additional aliases for it are created</p><div class="docText"><pre>    y = x</pre></div></li><LI><p class="docList">It is passed to a function (new local reference)</p><div class="docText"><pre>    foobar(x)</pre></div></LI><li><p class="docList">It becomes part of a container object</P><div class="docText"><pre>    myList = [123, x, 'xyz']</pre></div></li></UL>
<p class="docText">Now let us look at how reference counts go down.</P>

<a name="ch03lev3sec2"></a>
<h5 id="title-IDAUC1KN" class="docSection3Title">Decrementing the Reference Count</h5>
<p class="docText">When references to an object &quot;go away,&quot; the refcount is decreased. The most obvious case is when a reference goes out of scope. This occurs most often when the function in which a reference is made completes. The local (automatic) variable is gone, and an object's reference counter is decremented.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1632"></a><a name="iddle3200"></a><a name="iddle3634"></a>A reference also goes away when a variable is reassigned to another object. For example:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>  foo = 'xyz'
  bar = foo
  foo = 123</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">The reference count for string object &quot;<tt>xyz</tt>&quot; is one when it is created and assigned to <tt>foo</tt>. It is then incremented when <tt>bar</tt> is added as an alias. However, when <tt>foo</tt> is reassigned to the integer 123, the reference count to &quot;<tt>xyz</tt>&quot; is decremented by one.</p>
<p class="docText">Other ways in which an object's reference count goes down include explicit removal of a reference using the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>del</tt></span> statement (see next section), when an object is removed from a container (or if the reference count to that container itself goes to zero).</p>
<p class="docText">In summary, an object's refcount is decreased when:</P>
<ul><li><p class="docList">A local reference goes out of scope, i.e., when <tt>foobar()</tt> (see previous example) terminates</p></LI><LI><p class="docList">Aliases for that object are explicitly destroyed</p><div class="docText"><pre>     <span class="docEmphStrong">del</span> y            # or <span class="docEmphStrong">del</span> x</pre></div></li><li><p class="docList">An alias is reassigned to another object (taking on a new reference)</p><div class="docText"><pre>     x = 123</pre></div></li><li><p class="docList">It is explicitly removed from a container object</p><div class="docText"><pre>    myList.remove(x)</pre></div></li><li><p class="docList">The container itself is deallocated</p><div class="docText"><pre>     <span class="docEmphStrong">del</span> myList        # or goes out-of-scope</pre></div></li></ul>
<p class="docText">See <a class="docLink" href="ch11lev1sec8.html#ch11lev1sec8">Section 11.8</a> for more information on variable scope.</P>

<a name="ch03lev3sec3"></a>
<h5 id="title-IDAJH1KN" class="docSection3Title"><tt>del</tt> Statement</H5>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>del</tt></span> statement removes a single reference to an object. Its syntax is:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>     <span class="docEmphStrong">del</span> <span class="docEmphasis">obj1[, obj2[,... objN]</span>]</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">For example, executing <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>del</tt></span> <tt>y</tt> in the example above has two results:</p>
<UL><li><p class="docList">Removes name <tt>y</tt> from current namespace</P></LI><LI><p class="docList">Lowers reference count to object <tt>x</tt> (by one)</P></li></ul>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1560"></a><a name="iddle2032"></a><a name="iddle2231"></a><a name="iddle2836"></a><a name="iddle3571"></a><a name="iddle4156"></a>Further still, executing <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>del</tt></span> <tt>x</tt> will remove the final reference to the object, decrementing the reference counter to zero and causing the object to become &quot;inaccessible&quot; or &quot;unreachable.&quot; It is at this point that the object becomes a candidate for garbage collection. Note that any tracing or debugging facility may keep additional references to an object, delaying or postponing that object from being garbage-collected.</p>


<a name="ch03lev2sec22"></a>
<H4 id="title-IDATK1KN" class="docSection2Title">3.5.5. Garbage Collection</h4>
<p class="docText">Memory that is no longer being used is reclaimed by the system using a mechanism known as <span class="docEmphasis">garbage collection</span>. The interpreter keeps track of reference counts as above, but it is up to the garbage collector to deallocate the memory. The garbage collector is a separate piece of code that looks for objects with reference counts of zero. It is also responsible to check for objects with a reference count greater than zero that need to be deallocated. Certain situations lead to <span class="docEmphasis">cycles</span>.</P>
<p class="docText">A cyclic reference is where you have (at least two) objects that refer to each other, and even if all other references fall by the wayside, these references still exist, meaning that reference counting alone is not good enough.</p>
<p class="docText">Python's garbage collector is actually a combination of reference counting and the periodic invocation of a cyclic garbage collector. When an object's refcount reaches zero, the interpreter pauses to deallocate it and all objects that were reachable only from that object. In addition to this reference counting, the garbage collector also notices if a large number of objects have been allocated (and not deallocated though reference counting). In such cases, the interpreter will pause to try to clear out any unreferenced cycles.</P>
