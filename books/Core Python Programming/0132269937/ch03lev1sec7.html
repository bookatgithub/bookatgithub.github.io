<p class="docText">The Python Style Guide (PEP 8), Python Quick Reference Guide, and the Python FAQ make for great reading as developer &quot;tools.&quot; In addition, there are some modules that may help you become a more proficient Python programmer:</p>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">Debugger: <tt>pdb</tt></P></LI><li><p class="docList">Logger: <tt>logging</tt></p></li><LI><p class="docList">Profilers: <tt>profile</tt>, <tt>hotshot</tt>, <tt>cProfile</tt></p></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">The debugging module <tt>pdb</tt> allows you to set (conditional) breakpoints, single-step through lines of code, and check out stack frames. It also lets you perform post-mortem debugging.</P>

<p class="docText">The <tt>logging</tt> module, which was added in <a class="docLink" href="ch05lev1sec2.html#ch05lev3sec3">Python 2.3</a>, defines functions and classes that help you implement a flexible logging system for your application. There are five levels of logging you can use: critical, error, warning, info, and debug.</P>
<p class="docText">Python has had a history of profilers, mostly because they were implemented at different times by different people with different needs. The original Python <tt>profile</tt> module was written in pure Python and measured the time spent in functions, the total time as well as the time spent per call, <a name="iddle1548"></a><a name="iddle2329"></a><a name="iddle2941"></a><a name="iddle2950"></a><a name="iddle2964"></a><a name="iddle3462"></a>either only the time spent in particular functions or including subsequent (sub)functions calls from there. It is the oldest and the slowest of the three profilers but still gives useful profiling information.</P>
<p class="docText">The <tt>hotshot</tt> module was added in <a class="docLink" href="ch05lev1sec2.html#ch05lev3sec2">Python 2.2</a> and was intended to replace <tt>profile</tt> because it fixes various errors that <tt>profile</tt> was prone to and has improved performance due to being implemented in C. Note that <tt>hotshot</tt> focuses on reducing profiling overhead during execution but could take longer to deliver results. A critical bug in the timing code was fixed in Python 2.5.</p>
<p class="docText">The <tt>cProfile</tt> module, which was added in Python 2.5, was meant to replace the <tt>hotshot</tt> and <tt>profile</tt> modules. The one significant flaw identified by the authors of <tt>cProfile</tt> is that it takes a long time to load results from the log file, does not support detailed child function statistics, and some results appear inaccurate. It is also implemented in C.</p>
