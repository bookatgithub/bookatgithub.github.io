<p class="docText">If the above section was not motivation enough, imagine what Python programming might be like without program-level exception handling. The first thing that comes to mind is the loss of control client programmers have over their code. For example, if you created an interactive application that allocates and utilizes a large number of resources, if a user hit ^C or other keyboard interrupt, the application would not have the opportunity to perform cleanup, resulting in perhaps loss of data or data corruption. There is also no mechanism to take alternative action such as prompting the users to confirm whether they really want to quit or if they hit the Control key accidentally.</p>
<p class="docText">Another drawback would be that functions would have to be rewritten to return a &quot;special&quot; value in the face of an error situation, for example, <tt>None</tt>. The engineer would be responsible for checking each and every return <a name="iddle1872"></a><a name="iddle4111"></a>value from a function call. This may be cumbersome because you may have to check return values, which may not be of the same type as the object you are expecting if no errors occurred. And what if your function wants to return <tt>None</tt> as a valid data value? Then you would have to come up with another return value, perhaps a negative number. We probably do not need to remind you that negative numbers may be valid in a Python context, such as an index into a sequence. As a programmer of application programmer interfaces (APIs), you would then have to document every single return error your users may encounter based on the input received. Also, it is difficult (and tedious) to propagate errors (and reasons) of multiple layers of code.</P>
<p class="docText">There is no simple propagation like the way exceptions do it. Because error data needs to be transmitted upwards in the call hierarchy, it is possible to misinterpret the errors along the way. A totally unrelated error may be stated as the cause when in fact it had nothing to do with the original problem to begin with. We lose the bottling-up and safekeeping of the original error that exceptions provide as they are passed from layer to layer, not to mention completely losing track of the data we were originally concerned about! Exceptions simplify not only the code, but the entire error management scheme, which should not play such a significant role in application development. And with Python's exception handling capabilities, it does not have to.</P>
