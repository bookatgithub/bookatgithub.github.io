<p class="docText">The unification of <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>TRy-except</tt></span> and <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>TRy-finally</tt></span> as described above makes programs more &quot;Pythonic,&quot; meaning, among many other characteristics, simpler to write and easier to read. Python already does a great job at hiding things under the covers so all you have to do is worry about how to solve the problem you have. (Can you imagine porting a complex Python application into C++ or Java?!?)</P>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/2_5_2_6.jpg"></p>


<p class="docText">Another example of hiding lower layers of abstraction is the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement, made official as of Python 2.6. (It was introduced in 2.5 as a preview and to serve warnings for those applications using <tt>with</tt> as an identifier that it will become a keyword in 2.6. To use this feature in 2.5, you must import it with <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>from</tt></span> <tt>__future__</tt> <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>import</tt></span><tt>with_statement</tt>.)</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle4237"></a>Like <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>try-except-finally</tt></span>, the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement, has a purpose of simplifying code that features the common idiom of using the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>TRy-except</tt></span> and <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>try-finally</tt></span> pairs in tandem. The specific use that the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement targets is when <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>TRy-except</tt></span> and <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>try-finally</tt></span> are used together in order to achieve the sole allocation of a shared resource for execution, then releasing it once the job is done. Examples include files (data, logs, database, etc.), threading resources and synchronization primitives, database connections, etc.</P>
<p class="docText">However, instead of just shortening the code and making it easier to use like <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>try-except-finally</tt></span>, the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement's goal is to remove the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>TRy</tt></span>, <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>except</tt></span>, and <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>finally</tt></span> keywords and the allocation and release code from the picture altogether. The basic syntax of the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement looks like this:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">with</span> <span class="docEmphasis">context_expr</span> [<span class="docEmphStrong">as</span> var]:
    <span class="docEmphasis">with_suite</span></pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">It looks quite simple, but making it work requires some work under the covers. The reason is it not as simple as it looks is because you cannot use the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement merely with any expression in Python. It only works with objects that support what is called the <span class="docEmphasis">context management protocol</span>. This simply means that only objects that are built with &quot;context management&quot; can be used with a <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement. We will describe what that means soon.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, like any new video game hardware, when this feature was released, some folks out there took the time to develop new games for it so that you can play when you open the box. Similarly, there were already some Python objects that support the protocol. Here is a short list of the first set:</p>
<ul><LI><p class="docList"><tt>file</tt></p></li><LI><p class="docList"><tt>decimal.Context</tt></p></li><li><p class="docList"><tt>tHRead.LockType</tt></P></li><li><p class="docList"><tt>threading.Lock</tt></p></li><li><p class="docList"><tt>threading.RLock</tt></p></li><li><p class="docList"><tt>threading.Condition</tt></p></LI><li><p class="docList"><tt>tHReading.Semaphore</tt></p></LI><li><p class="docList"><tt>tHReading.BoundedSemaphore</tt></p></LI></UL>
<p class="docText">Since files are first on the list and the simplest example, here is a code snippet of what it looks like to use a <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">with</span> open('/etc/passwd', 'r') <span class="docEmphStrong">as</span> f:
     <span class="docEmphStrong">for</span> eachLine <span class="docEmphStrong">in</span> f:
          <span class="docEmphStrong">#</span> ...do stuff with eachLine or f...</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1524"></a>What this code snippet will do is... well, this <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> Python, so you can probably already guess. It will do some preliminary work, such as attempt to open the file, and if all goes well, assign the file object to <tt>f</tt>. Then it iterates over each line in the file and does whatever processing you need to do. Once the file has been exhausted, it is closed. If an exception occurs either at the beginning, middle, or end of the block, then some cleanup code must be done, but the file will still be closed automatically.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, because a lot of the details have been pushed down and away from you, there are really two levels of processing that need to occur: First, the stuff at the user levelas in, the things you need to take care of as the user of the objectand second, at the object level. Since this object supports the context management protocol, it has to do some &quot;context management.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAWM2KN" class="docSection2Title">10.4.2. *Context Management Protocol</H4>
<p class="docText">Unless you will be designing objects for users of the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement, i.e., programmers who will be using your objects to design their applications with, most Python programmers are going to be just users of the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement and can skip this optional section.</p>
<p class="docText">We are not going into a full and deep discussion about context management here, but we will explain the types of objects and the functionality that are necessary to be protocol-compliant and thus be eligible to be used with the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement.</P>
<p class="docText">Previously, we described a little of how the protocol works in our example with the file object. Let us elaborate some more here.</p>
<a name="ch10lev3sec2"></a>
<H5 id="title-IDATN2KN" class="docSection3Title">Context Expression <tt>(context_expr)</tt>, Context Manager</h5>
<p class="docText">When the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement is executed, the context expression is evaluated to obtain what is called a <span class="docEmphasis">context manager</span>. The job of the context manager is to provide a context object. It does this by invoking its required <tt>__context__()</tt> special method. The return value of this method is the context object that will be used for this particular execution of the <tt>with_suite</tt>. One side note is that a context object itself can be its own manager, so <span class="docEmphasis">context_expr</span> can really be either a real context manager or a context object serving as its own manager. In the latter case, the context object also has a <tt>__context__()</tt> method, which returns <tt>self</tt>, as expected.</P>

<a name="ch10lev3sec3"></a>

<H5 id="title-IDAUO2KN" class="docSection3Title">Context Object, <tt>with_suite</tt></h5>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1805"></a><a name="iddle1918"></a><a name="iddle4521"></a>Once we have a context object, its <tt>__enter__()</tt> special method is invoked. This does all the preliminary stuff before the <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>with_suite</tt></span> executes. You will notice in the syntax above that there is an optional <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>as</tt></span> <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>var</tt></span> piece following <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>context_expr</tt></span> on the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement line. If <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>var</tt></span> is provided, it is assigned the return value of <tt>__enter__()</tt>. If not, the return value is thrown away. So for our file object example, its context object's <tt>__enter__()</tt> returns the file object so it can be assigned to <tt>f</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText">Now the <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>with_suite</tt></span> executes. When execution of <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>with_suite</tt></span> terminates, whether &quot;naturally&quot; or via exception, the context object's <tt>__exit__()</tt> special method is called.<tt>__exit__()</tt>takes three arguments. If <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>with_suite</tt></span> terminates normally, all three parameters passed in are <tt>None</tt>. If an exception occurred, then the three arguments are the same three values returned when calling the <tt>sys.exc_info()</tt> function (see <a class="docLink" href="ch10lev1sec12.html#ch10lev1sec12">section 10.12</a>): <tt>type</tt> (exception class), <tt>value</tt> (this exception's instance), and <tt>traceback</tt>, the corresponding traceback object.</p>
<p class="docText">It is up to you to decide how you want to handle the exception here in <tt>__exit__()</tt>. The usual thing to do after you are done is not to return anything from <tt>__exit__()</tt> or return <tt>None</tt> or some other Boolean <tt>False</tt> object. This will cause the exception to be reraised back to your user for handling. If you want to explicitly silence the exception, then return any object that has a Boolean <tt>TRue</tt> value. If an exception did not occur or you returned <tt>true</tt> after handling an exception, the program will continue on the next statement after the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> clause.</p>
<p class="docText">Since context management makes the most sense for shared resources, you can imagine that the <tt>__enter__()</tt> and <tt>__exit__()</tt> methods will primarily be used for doing the lower-level work required to allocate and release resources, i.e., database connections, lock allocation, semaphore decrement, state management, opening/closing of files, exception handling, etc.</P>
<p class="docText">To help you with writing context managers for objects, there is the <tt>contextlib</tt> module, which contains useful functions/decorators with which you can apply over your functions or objects and not have to worry about implementing a class or separate <tt>__context__()</tt>, <tt>__enter__()</tt>, <tt>__exit__()</tt> special methods.</p>
<p class="docText">For more information or more examples of context management, check out the official Python documentation on the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> statement and <tt>contextlib</tt> module, class special methods (related to <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>with</tt></span> and contexts), PEP 343, and the &quot;What's New in Python 2.5&quot; document.</p>
