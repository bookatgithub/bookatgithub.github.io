<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> <span class="docEmphasis">function_name(arguments):</span>
    <span class="docEmphasis">"function_documentation_string"</span>
    <span class="docEmphasis">function_body_suite</span></pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">The header line consists of the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>def</tt></span> keyword, the function name, and a set of arguments (if any). The remainder of the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>def</tt></span> clause consists of an optional but highly recommended documentation string and the required function body suite. We have seen many function declarations throughout this text, and here is another:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> helloSomeone(who):
  'returns a salutory string customized with the input'
  <span class="docEmphStrong">return</span> "Hello " + str(who)</pre></div><br>

<h4 id="title-IDAX4WJ" class="docSection2Title">11.3.2. Declaration versus Definition</h4>
<p class="docText">Some programming languages differentiate between function declarations and function definitions. A function declaration consists of providing the parser with the function name, and the names (and traditionally the types) of its arguments, without necessarily giving any lines of code for the function, which is usually referred to as the function definition.</P>
<p class="docText">In languages where there is a distinction, it is usually because the function definition may belong in a physically different location in the code from the function declaration. Python does not make a distinction between the two, as a function clause is made up of a declarative header line immediately followed by its defining suite.</p>

<a name="ch11lev2sec9"></a>
<H4 id="title-IDAF5WJ" class="docSection2Title">11.3.3. Forward References</h4>
<p class="docText">Like some other high-level languages, Python does not permit you to reference or call a function before it has been declared. We can try a few examples to illustrate this:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'in foo()'
    bar()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">If we were to call <tt>foo()</tt> here, it would fail because <tt>bar()</tt> has not been declared yet:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
in foo()
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in foo
NameError: bar</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">We will now define <tt>bar()</tt>, placing its declaration before <tt>foo()</tt> 's declaration:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> bar():
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'in bar()'

<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
   <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'in foo()'
   bar()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Now we can safely call <tt>foo()</tt> with no problems:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
in foo()
in bar()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">In fact, we can even declare <tt>foo()</tt> before <tt>bar()</tt>:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'in foo()'
    bar()

<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> bar():
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'in bar()'</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Amazingly enough, this code still works fine with no forward referencing problems:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
in foo()
in bar()</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">This piece of code is fine because even though a call to <tt>bar()</tt> (from <tt>foo()</tt> ) appears before <tt>bar()</tt> 's definition, <tt>foo()</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">itself</span> is not called before <tt>bar()</tt> is declared. In other words, we declared <tt>foo()</tt>, then <tt>bar()</tt>, and <span class="docEmphasis">then</span> called <tt>foo()</tt>, but by that time, <tt>bar()</tt> existed already, so the call succeeds.</p>
<p class="docText">Notice that the output of <tt>foo()</tt> succeeded before the error came about. <tt>NameError</tt> is the exception that is always raised when any uninitialized identifiers are accessed.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAJEXJ" class="docSection2Title">11.3.4. Function Attributes</H4>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1156"></a><a name="iddle2135"></a>We will briefly discuss namespaces later on in this chapter, especially their relationship to variable scope. There will be a more in-depth treatment of namespaces in the next chapter; however, here we want to point out a basic feature of Python namespaces.</P>
<p class="docText">You get a free one with every Python module, class, and function. You can have a variable named <tt>x</tt> in modules <tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt>, but can use them in your current application upon importing both modules. So even though the same variable name is used in both modules, you are safe because the dotted attribute notation implies a separate namespace for both, i.e., there is no naming conflict in this snippet of code:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> foo, bar
<span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> foo.x + bar.x</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Function attributes are another area of Python to use the dotted-attribute notation and have a namespace. (More on namespaces later on in this chapter as well as Chapter 12 on Python modules.)</p>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084204" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/2_1.jpg"></p>

<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    'foo() -- properly created doc string'

<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> bar():
    <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span>

bar.__doc__ = 'Oops, forgot the doc str above'
bar.version = 0.1</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">In <tt>foo()</tt> above, we create our documentation string as normal, e.g., the first unassigned string after the function declaration. When declaring <tt>bar()</tt>, we left everything out and just used the dotted-attribute notation to add its doc string as well as another attribute. We can then access the attributes freely. Below is an example with the interactive interpreter. (As you may already be aware, using the built-in function <tt>help()</tt> gives more of a pretty-printing format than just using the vanilla print of the <tt>__doc__</tt> attribute, but you can use either one you wish.)</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(foo)
Help on function foo in module __main__:

foo()
    foo() -- properly created doc string
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> bar.version

0.1

&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> foo.__doc__
foo() -- properly created doc string
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> bar.__doc__
Oops, forgot the doc str above</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1628"></a><a name="iddle2165"></a><a name="iddle2432"></a><a name="iddle2626"></a>Notice how we can define the documentation string outside of the function declaration. Yet we can still access it at runtime just like normal. One thing that you cannot do, however, is get access to the attributes in the function declaration. In other words, there is no such thing as a &quot;self&quot; inside a function declaration so that you can make an assignment like <tt>__dict__['version']</tt> <tt>=</tt> <tt>0.1</tt>. The reason for this is because the function object has not even been created yet, but afterward you have the function object and can add to its dictionary in the way we described above ... another free namespace!</p>
<p class="docText">Function attributes were added to Python in 2.1, and you can read more about them in PEP 232.</p>

<a name="ch11lev2sec11"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDADJXJ" class="docSection2Title">11.3.5. Inner or Nested Functions</h4>
<p class="docText">It is perfectly legitimate to create function (object)s inside other functions. That is the definition of an <span class="docEmphasis">inner</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">nested function</span>. Because Python now supports statically nested scoping (introduced in 2.1 but standard as of 2.2), inner functions are actually useful now. It made no sense for older versions of Python, which only supported the global and one local scope. So how does one create a nested function?</p>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084204" width="50" height="48" SRC="images/2_2.jpg"></P>


<p class="docText">The (obvious) way to create an inner function is to define a function from within an outer function's definition (using the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>def</tt></span> keyword), as in:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> bar():
        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'bar() called'

    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'foo() called'
    bar()

foo()
bar()</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">If we stick this code in a module, say <tt>inner.py</tt>, and run it, we get the following output:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>foo() called
bar() called
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "inner.py", line 11, in ?
    bar()
NameError: name 'bar' is not defined</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1001"></a><a name="iddle1146"></a><a name="iddle1429"></a><a name="iddle1622"></a><a name="iddle2148"></a><a name="iddle2635"></a><a name="iddle2864"></a><a name="iddle4099"></a>One interesting aspect of inner functions is that they are wholly contained inside the outer function's <span class="docEmphasis">scope</span> (the places where you can access an object; more on scope later on in this chapter). If there are no outside references to <tt>bar()</tt>, it cannot be called from anywhere else except inside the outer function, hence the reason for the exception you see at the end of execution in the above code snippet.</p>
<p class="docText">Another way of creating a function object while inside a(nother) function is by using the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>lambda</tt></span> statement. We will cover this later on in <a class="docLink" href="ch11lev1sec7.html#ch11lev2sec18">Section 11.7.1</a>.</P>
<p class="docText">Inner functions turn into something special called <span class="docEmphasis">closures</span> if the definition of an inner function contains a reference to an object defined in an outer function. (It can even be beyond the immediately enclosing outer function too.) We will learn more about closures coming up in <a class="docLink" href="ch11lev1sec8.html#ch11lev2sec24">Section 11.8.4</a>. In the next section, we will introduce decorators, but the example application also includes a preview of a closure.</p>

<a name="ch11lev2sec12"></a>
<H4 id="title-IDA3NXJ" class="docSection2Title">11.3.6. <tt>*</tt>Function (and Method) Decorators</H4>
<p class="docText">The main motivation behind <span class="docEmphasis">decorators</span> came from Python object-oriented programming (OOP). Decorators are just &quot;overlays&quot; on top of function calls. These overlays are just additional calls that are applied when a function or method is declared.</P>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084204" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/2_4.jpg"></P>


<p class="docText">The syntax for decorators uses a leading &quot;at-sign&quot; ( <tt>@</tt> ) followed by the decorator function name and optional arguments. The line following the decorator declaration is the function being decorated, along with <span class="docEmphasis">its</span> optional arguments. It looks something like this:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>@decorator(<span class="docEmphasis">dec_opt_args</span>)
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> func2Bdecorated(<span class="docEmphasis">func_opt_args</span>):
    :</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">So how (and why) did this syntax come into being? What was the inspiration behind decorators? Well, when static and class methods were added to Python in 2.2, the idiom required to realize them was clumsy, confusing, and makes code less readable, i.e.,</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> MyClass(object):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> staticFoo():
       :
    staticFoo = staticmethod(staticFoo)
       :</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1103"></a><a name="iddle2133"></a>(It was clearly stated for that release that this was not the final syntax anyway.) Within this class declaration, we define a method named <tt>staticFoo()</tt>. Now since this is intended to become a static method, we leave out the <tt>self</tt> argument, which is required for standard class methods, as you will see in <a class="docLink" href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a>. The <tt>staticmethod()</tt> built-in function is then used to &quot;convert&quot; the function into a static method, but note how &quot;sloppy&quot; it looks with <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>def</tt></span> <tt>staticFoo()</tt> followed by <tt>staticFoo</tt> <tt>=</tt> <tt>staticmethod (staticFoo)</tt>. With decorators, you can now replace that piece of code with the following:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> MyClass(object):
    @staticmethod
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> staticFoo():
              :</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">Furthermore, decorators can be &quot;stacked&quot; like function calls, so here is a more general example with multiple decorators:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>@deco2
@deco1
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> func(<span class="docEmphasis">arg1, arg2</span>, ...): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span></pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">This is equivalent to creating a <span class="docEmphasis">composite</span> function:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> func(<span class="docEmphasis">arg1, arg2</span>, ...): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span>
func = deco2(deco1(func))</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">Function composition in math is defined like this: <tt>(g</tt> <tt>&#183;</tt> <tt>f)(x)</tt> <tt>=</tt> <tt>g(f(x))</tt>. For consistency in Python:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>@g
@f
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    :</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">... is the same as <tt>foo</tt> <tt>=</tt> <tt>g(f(foo))</tt>.</p>
<a name="ch11lev3sec3"></a>
<h5 id="title-IDAIUXJ" class="docSection3Title">Decorators With and Without Arguments</h5>
<p class="docText">Yes the syntax is slightly mind-bending at first, but once you are comfortable with it, the only twist on top of that is when you use decorators with arguments. Without arguments, a decorator like:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>@deco
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo(): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span></pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">... is pretty straightforward:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>foo = deco(foo)</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1085"></a><a name="iddle1124"></a>Function composition without arguments (as seen above) follows. However, a decorator <tt>decomaker()</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">with</span> arguments:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>@decomaker(<span class="docEmphasis">deco_args</span>)
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo(): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span></pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">... needs to itself return a decorator that takes the function as an argument. In other words, <tt>decomaker()</tt> does something with <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>deco_args</tt></span> and returns a function object that is a decorator that takes <tt>foo</tt> as its argument. To put it simply:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>foo = decomaker(<span class="docEmphasis">deco_args</span>)(foo)</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">Here is an example featuring multiple decorators in which one takes an argument:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>@deco1(<span class="docEmphasis">deco_arg</span>)
@deco2
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> func(): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span></pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">This is equivalent to:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>func = deco1(<span class="docEmphasis">deco_arg</span>)(deco2(func))</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">We hope that if you understand these examples here, things will become much clearer. We present a more useful yet still simple script below where the decorator does not take an argument. <a class="docLink" href="ch11lev1sec8.html#ch11list08">Example 11.8</a> is an intermediate script with a decorator that <span class="docEmphasis">does</span> take an argument.</p>

<a name="ch11lev3sec4"></a>
<h5 id="title-IDASYXJ" class="docSection3Title">So What Are Decorators?</h5>
<p class="docText">We know that decorators are really functions now. We also know that they take function objects. But what will they do with those functions? Generally, when you wrap a function, you eventually <span class="docEmphasis">call</span> it. The nice thing is that we can do that whenever it is appropriate for our wrapper. We can run some preliminary code before executing the function or some cleanup code afterward, like postmortem analysis. It is up to the programmer. So when you see a decorator function, be prepared to find some code in it, and somewhere embedded within its definition, a call or at least <span class="docEmphasis">some</span> reference, to the target function.</p>
<p class="docText">This feature essentially introduces the concept that Java developers call AOP, or aspect-oriented programming. You can place code in your decorators for concerns that cut across your application. For example, you can use decorators to:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Introduce logging</p></li><LI><p class="docList">Insert timing logic (aka <span class="docEmphasis">instrumentation</span>) for monitoring performance</p></LI><li><p class="docList">Add transactional capabilities to functions</P></li></UL>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2156"></a><a name="iddle4186"></a>The ability to support decorators is very important for creating enterprise applications in Python. You will see that the bullet points above correspond quite closely to our example below as well as <a class="docLink" href="#ch11list02">Example 11.2</a>.</p>

<a name="ch11lev3sec5"></a>
<H5 id="title-IDAM0XJ" class="docSection3Title">Decorator Example</H5>
<p class="docText">We have an extremely simple example below, but it should get you started in really understanding how decorators work. This example &quot;decorates&quot; a (useless) function by displaying the time that it was executed. It is a &quot;timestamp decoration&quot; similar to the timestamp server that we discuss in <a class="docLink" href="ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a>.</P>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">This demonstration of a decorator (and closures) shows that it is merely a &quot;wrapper&quot; with which to &quot;decorate&quot; (or overlay) a function, returning the altered function object and reassigning it to the original identifier, forever losing access to the original function object.</span></p>
