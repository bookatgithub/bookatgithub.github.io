<h3 id="700181-863" class="docSection1Title">11.8. Variable Scope</H3>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">scope</span> of an identifier is defined to be the portion of the program where its declaration applies, or what we refer to as &quot;variable visibility.&quot; In other words, it is like asking yourself in which parts of a program do you have access to a specific identifier. Variables either have local or global scope.</p>
<a name="ch11lev2sec21"></a>
<H4 id="title-IDAGH5VD" class="docSection2Title">11.8.1. Global versus Local Variables</H4>
<p class="docText">Variables defined within a function have <span class="docEmphasis">local</span> scope, and those at the highest level in a module have <span class="docEmphasis">global</span> scope. In their famous &quot;dragon&quot; book on compiler theory, Aho, Sethi, and Ullman summarize it this way:</P>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2344"></a><a name="iddle3034"></a><a name="iddle3048"></a><a name="iddle3376"></a><a name="iddle3698"></a>&quot;The portion of the program to which a declaration applies is called the <span class="docEmphasis">scope</span> of that declaration. An occurrence of a name in a procedure is said to be <span class="docEmphasis">local</span> to the procedure if it is in the scope of a declaration within the procedure; otherwise, the occurrence is said to be <span class="docEmphasis">nonlocal</span>.&quot;</P>
<p class="docText">One characteristic of global variables is that unless deleted, they have a lifespan that lasts as long as the script that is running and whose values are accessible to all functions, whereas local variables, like the stack frame they reside in, live temporarily, only as long as the functions they are defined in are currently active. When a function call is made, its local variables come into scope as they are declared. At that time, a new local name is created for that object, and once that function has completed and the frame deallocated, that variable will go out of scope.</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>global_str = 'foo'
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    local_str = 'bar'
    <span class="docEmphStrong">return</span> global_str + local_str</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">In the above example, <tt>global_str</tt> is a global variable while <tt>local_str</tt> is a local variable. The <tt>foo()</tt> function has access to both global and local variables while the main block of code has access only to global variables.</p>

The concept of scope relates to the namespace search order that is used to find a variable. All names in the local namespace are within the local scope when a function is executing. That is the first namespace searched when looking for a variable. If it is not found there, then perhaps a globally scoped variable with that name can be found. These variables are stored (and searched) in the global and built-in namespaces.</span></P><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">It is possible to &quot;hide&quot; or override a global variable just by creating a local one. Recall that the local namespace is searched first, being in its local scope. If the name is found, the search does not continue to search for a globally scoped variable, hence overriding any matching name in either the global or built-in namespaces.</span></p></td></tr></table></p></div><BR>

<p class="docText">Our local <tt>bar</tt> pushed the global <tt>bar</tt> out of the local scope. To specifically reference a named global variable, one must use the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>global</tt></span> statement. The syntax for global is:</P>

<h4 id="title-IDAWU5VD" class="docSection2Title">11.8.4. Closures</H4>
<p class="docText">With Python's statically nested scoping, it becomes useful to define inner functions as we have seen earlier. In the next section, we will focus on scope and <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>lambda</tt></span>, but inner functions also suffered the same problem before <a class="docLink" href="ch05lev1sec2.html#ch05lev3sec1">Python 2.1</a> when the scoping rules changed to what they are today.</p>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084202" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/2_1.jpg"></P>


<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2093"></a>If references are made from inside an inner function to an object defined in any outer scope (but not in the global scope), the inner function then is known as a <span class="docEmphasis">closure</span>. The variables defined in the outer function but used or referred to by the inner function are called <span class="docEmphasis">free variables</span>. Closures are an important concept in functional programming languages, with Scheme and Haskell being two of them. Closures are syntactically simple (as simple as inner functions) yet still very powerful.</p>
<p class="docText">A closure combines an inner function's own code and scope along with the scope of an outer function. Closure lexical variables do not belong to the global namespace scope or the local onethey belong to someone else's namespace and carry an &quot;on the road&quot; kind of scope. (Note that they differ from objects in that those variables live in an object's namespace while closure variables live in a function's namespace and scope.) So why would you want to use closures?</P>
<p class="docText">Closures are useful for setting up calculations, hiding state, letting you move around function objects and scope at will. Closures come in handy in GUI or event-driven programming where a lot of APIs support callbacks. The same applies for retrieving database rows and processing the data in the exact same manner. Callbacks are just functions. Closures are functions, too, but they carry some additional scope with them. They are just functions with an extra feature ... another scope.</p>
<p class="docText">You will probably feel that the use of closures draws a strong parallel to partial function application as introduced earlier in this chapter, but PFA is really more like currying than the use of closures because it is not as much as about function calling as it is about using variables defined in another scope.</P>
<a name="ch11lev3sec17"></a>
<H5 id="title-IDAMW5VD" class="docSection3Title">Simple Closure Example</H5>
<p class="docText">Below is a short example of using closures. We will simulate a counter and also simulate making an integer mutable by enclosing it as a single element of a list.</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> counter(start_at=0):
     count = [start_at]
     <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> incr():
         count[0] += 1
         <span class="docEmphStrong">return</span> count[0]
     <span class="docEmphStrong">return</span> incr</pre></div><br>

<p class="docText">The only thing <tt>counter()</tt> does is to accept an initial value to start counting at and assigns it as the sole member of the list count. Then an <tt>incr()</tt> inner function is defined. By using the variable count inside it, we have created a closure because it now carries with it the scope of <tt>counter()</tt>. <tt>incr()</tt> increments the <a name="iddle2094"></a><a name="iddle2666"></a>running count and returns it. Then the final magic is that <tt>counter()</tt> returns <tt>incr</tt>, a (callable) function object.</p>
<p class="docText">If we run this interactively, we get the output belownote how similar it looks to instantiating a counter object and executing the instance:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; count = counter(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> count()
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> count()
7
&gt;&gt;&gt; count2 = counter(100)
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> count2()
101
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> count()
8</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">The one difference is that we were able to do something that previously required us to write a class, and not only that, but to have to override the <tt>__call__()</tt> special method of that class to make its instances callable. Here we were able to do it with a pair of functions.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, in many cases, a class is the right thing to use. Closures are more appropriate in cases whenever you need a callback that has to have its own scope, especially if it is something small and simple, and often, clever. As usual, if you use a closure, it is a good idea to comment your code and/or use doc strings to explain what you are doing.</P>

<H5 id="title-IDACR35H" class="docSection4Title">Lines 510, 2832</h5>
<p class="docText">This body of code represents the core part of the <tt>logged()</tt> function, whose responsibility it is to take the user's request as to when the function call should be logged. Should it be before the target function is called or after? <tt>logged()</tt> has three helper inner functions defined within its definition: <tt>log()</tt>, <tt>pre_logged()</tt>, and <tt>post_logged()</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText"><tt>log()</tt> is the function that does the actual logging. It just displays to standard output the name of the function and its arguments. If you were to use this function &quot;in the real world,&quot; you would most likely send this output to a file, a database, or perhaps standard error (<tt>sys.stderr</tt>).</p>
<p class="docText">The last part of <tt>logged()</tt> in lines 28-32 is actually the first lines of code in the function that are not function declarations. It reads the user's selection when, and returns one of the <tt>*logged()</tt> functions so that <span class="docEmphasis">it</span> can then be called with the target function to wrap it.</p>

<a name="ch11lev4sec16"></a>
<H5 id="title-IDAIS35H" class="docSection4Title">Lines 1226</h5>
<p class="docText"><tt>pre_logged()</tt> and <tt>post_logged()</tt> will both wrap the target function and log it in accordance with its name, e.g., <tt>post_logged()</tt> will log the function call <span class="docEmphasis">after</span> the target function has executed while <tt>pre_logged()</tt> does it before execution.</p>
<p class="docText">Depending on the user's selection, one of <tt>pre_logged()</tt> and <tt>post_logged()</tt> will be returned. When the decorator is called, it evaluates the decorator function first along with its argument. e.g., <tt>logged(when)</tt>. Then the returned function object is called with the target function as its parameter, e.g., <tt>pre_logged(f)</tt> or <tt>post_logged(f)</tt>.</P>
<p class="docText">Both <tt>*logged()</tt> functions include a closure named <tt>wrapper()</tt>. It calls the target function while logging it as appropriate. The functions return the wrapped function object, which then is reassigned to the original target function identifier.</p>

<H4 id="title-IDA4U35H" class="docSection2Title">11.8.5. Scope and <tt>lambda</tt></h4>
<p class="docText">Python's <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>lambda</tt></span> anonymous functions follow the same scoping rules as standard functions. A <tt>lambda</tt> expression defines a new scope, just like a function definition, so the scope is inaccessible to any other part of the program except for that local <tt>lambda</tt>/function.</p>
<p class="docText">Those <tt>lambda</tt> expressions declared local to a function are accessible only within that function; however, the expression in the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>lambda</tt></span> statement has the same scope access as the function. You can also think of a function and a <tt>lambda</tt> expression as siblings.</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>x = 10
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    y = 5
    bar = <span class="docEmphStrong">lambda</span> :x+y
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> bar()</pre></div><br>

<p class="docText">We know that this code works fine now ...</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
15</pre></div><br>

<p class="docText">... however, we must again look to the past to see an extremely common idiom that was necessary to get code to work in older versions of Python. Before 2.1, we would get an error like what you see below because while the function and <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>lambda</tt></span> have access to global variables, neither has access to the other's local scopes:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
Traceback (innermost last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 4, in foo
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in &lt;lambda&gt;
NameError: y</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">In the example above, although the <tt>lambda</tt> expression was created in the local scope of <tt>foo()</tt>, it has access to only two scopes: its local scope and the global scope (also see <a class="docLink" href="#ch11lev2sec23">Section 11.8.3</a>). The solution was to add a variable with a default argument so that we could pass in a variable from an outer local scope to an inner one. In our example above, we would change the line with the lambda to look like this:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>bar = <span class="docEmphStrong">lambda</span>  y=y: x+y</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">With this change, it now works. The outer <tt>y</tt>'s value will be passed in as an argument and hence the local <tt>y</tt> (local to the <tt>lambda</tt> function). You will see this common idiom all over Python code that you will come across; however, it still does not address the possibility of the outer <tt>y</tt> changing values, such as:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>x = 10
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    y = 5
    bar = <span class="docEmphStrong">lambda</span>  y=y: x+y
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> bar()
    y = 8
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> bar()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">The output is &quot;totally wrong&quot;:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
15
15</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">The reason for this is that the value of the outer <tt>y</tt> was passed in and &quot;set&quot; in the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>lambda</tt></span>, so even though its value changed later on, the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>lambda</tt></span> definition did not. The only other alternative back then was to add a local variable <tt>z</tt> within the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>lambda</tt></span> expression that references the function local variable <tt>y</tt>.</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>x = 10
def foo():
    y = 5
    bar = <span class="docEmphStrong">lambda</span> z:x+z
    print bar(y)
    y = 8
    print bar(y)</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle3051"></a><a name="iddle3687"></a>All of this was necessary in order to get the correct output:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
15
18</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">This was also not preferred as now all places that call <tt>bar()</tt> would have to be changed to pass in a variable. Beginning in 2.1, the entire thing works perfectly without any modification:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>x = 10
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo():
    y = 5
    bar = <span class="docEmphStrong">lambda</span> :x+y
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> bar(y)
    y = 8
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> bar(y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
15
18</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Are you not glad that &quot;correct&quot; statically nested scoping was (finally) added to Python? Many of the &quot;old-timers&quot; certainly are. You can read more about this important change in PEP 227.</P>

<H4 id="title-IDAQ235H" class="docSection2Title">11.8.6. Variable Scope and Namespaces</H4>
<p class="docText">From our study in this chapter, we can see that at any given time, there are either one or two active scopesno more, no less. Either we are at the top-level of a module where we have access only to the global scope, or we are executing in a function where we have access to its local scope as well as the global scope. How do namespaces relate to scope?</P>
<p class="docText">From the Core Note in <a class="docLink" href="#ch11lev2sec21">Section 11.8.1</a> we can also see that, at any given time, there are either two or three active namespaces. From within a function, the local scope encompasses the local namespace, the first place a name is searched for. If the name exists here, then checking the global scope (global and built-in namespaces) is skipped. From the global scope (outside of any function), a name lookup begins with the global namespace. If no match is found, the search proceeds to the built-in namespace.</p>
<p class="docText">We will now present <a class="docLink" href="#ch11list09">Example 11.9</a>, a script with mixed scope everywhere. We leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine the output of the program.</p>
