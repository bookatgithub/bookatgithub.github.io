<h4 id="title-IDAMCXUD" class="docSection2Title">12.5.1. Module &quot;Executed&quot; When Loaded</H4>
<p class="docText">One effect of loading a module is that the imported module is &quot;executed,&quot; that is, the top-level portion of the imported module is directly executed. This usually includes setting up of global variables as well as performing the class and function declarations. If there is a check for <tt>__name__</tt> to do more on direct script invocation, that is executed, too.</P>
<p class="docText">Of course, this type of execution may or may not be the desired effect. If not, you will have to put as much code as possible into functions. Suffice it to say that good module programming style dictates that only function and/or class definitions should be at the top level of a module.</P>
<p class="docText">For more information see <a class="docLink" href="ch14lev1sec1.html#ch14lev2sec1">Section 14.1.1</a> and the Core Note contained therein.</P>
<p class="docText">A new feature was added to Python which allows you to execute an installed module as a script. (Sure, running your own script is easy [<tt>$ foo.py</tt>], but executing a module in the standard library or third party package is trickier.) You can read more about how to do this in <a class="docLink" href="ch14lev1sec4.html#ch14lev2sec13">Section 14.4.3</a>.</p>

This prevents the module &quot;execution&quot; from happening over and over again if multiple imports occur. If your module imports the <tt>sys</tt> module, and so do five of the other modules you import, it would not be wise to load <tt>sys</tt> (or any other module) each time! So rest assured, loading happens only once, on first import.</P>

<h4 id="title-IDAZGXUD" class="docSection2Title">12.5.3. Names Imported into Current <BR>Namespace</h4>
<p class="docText">Calling <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>from-import</tt></span> brings the name into the current namespace, meaning that you do not use the attribute/dotted notation to access the module identifier. For example, to access a variable named <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>var</tt></span> in module <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>module</tt></span> that was imported with:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">from</span> <span class="docEmphasis">module</span> <span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> <span class="docEmphasis">var</span></pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">we would use &quot;<span class="docEmphasis"><tt>var</tt></span>&quot; by itself. There is no need to reference the module since you imported <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>var</tt></span> into your namespace. It is also possible to import all the names from the module into the current namespace using the following <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>from-import</tt></span> statement:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">from</span> <span class="docEmphasis">module</span> <span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> *</pre></div><BR>

The first is where the target module has many attributes that would make it inconvenient to type in the module name over and over again. Two prime examples of this are the <tt>Tkinter</tt> (Python/Tk) and <tt>NumPy</tt> (Numeric Python) modules, and perhaps the <tt>socket</tt> module.

<H4 id="title-IDAMLXUD" class="docSection2Title">12.5.4. Names Imported into Importer's Scope</h4>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2393"></a><a name="iddle2955"></a><a name="iddle3686"></a>Another side effect of importing just names from modules is that those names are now part of the local namespace. A side effect is possibly hiding or overriding an existing object or built-in with the same name. Also, changes to the variable affect only the local copy and not the original in the imported module's namespace. In other words, the binding is now local rather than across namespaces.</p>
<p class="docText">Here we present the code to two modules: an importer, <tt>impter.py</tt>, and an importee, <tt>imptee.py.</tt> Currently, <tt>imptr.py</tt> uses the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>from-import</tt></span> statement, which creates only local bindings.</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>#############
# imptee.py #
#############
foo = 'abc'
<span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> show():
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'foo from imptee:', foo

#############
# impter.py #
#############
<span class="docEmphStrong">from</span> imptee <span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> foo, show
show()
foo = 123
<span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'foo from impter:', foo
show()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Upon running the importer, we discover that the importee's view of its <tt>foo</tt> variable has not changed even though we modified it in the importer.</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>foo from imptee: abc
foo from impter: 123
foo from imptee: abc</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">The only solution is to use import and <span class="docEmphasis">fully qualified</span> identifier names using the attribute/dotted notation.</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>#############
# impter.py #
#############
<span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> imptee
imptee.show()
imptee.foo = 123

<h4 id="title-IDADSXUD" class="docSection2Title">12.5.5. Back to the <tt>__future__</tt></h4>
<p class="docText">Back in the days of Python 2.0, it was recognized that due to improvements, new features, and current feature enhancements, certain significant changes could not be implemented without affecting some existing functionality. To better prepare Python programmers for what was coming down the line, the <tt>__future__</tt> directives were implemented.</P>
<p class="docText">By using the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>from-import</tt></span> statement and &quot;importing&quot; future functionality, users can get a taste of new features or feature changes enabling them to port their applications correctly by the time the feature becomes permanent. The syntax is:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">from</span> __future__ <span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> <span class="docEmphasis">new_feature</span></pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">It does not make sense to import <tt>__future__</tt> so that is disallowed. (Actually, it is allowed but does not do what you want it to do, which is enable all future features.) You have to import specific features explicitly. You can read more about <tt>__future__</tt> directives in PEP 236.</p>

<a name="ch12lev2sec15"></a>
<H4 id="title-IDARTXUD" class="docSection2Title">12.5.6. Warning Framework</h4>
<p class="docText">Similar to the <tt>__future__</tt> directive, it is also necessary to warn users when a feature is about to be changed or deprecated so that they can take action based on the notice received. There are multiple pieces to this feature, so we will break it down into components.</P>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084202" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/2_1.jpg"></p>


<p class="docText">The first piece is the application programmer's interface (API). Programmers have the ability to issue warnings from both Python programs (via the <tt>warnings</tt> module) as well as from C [via a call to <tt>PyErr_Warn()</tt>].</P>
<p class="docText">Another part of the framework is a new set of warning exception classes. <tt>Warning</tt> is subclassed directly from <tt>Exception</tt> and serves as the root of all warnings: <tt>UserWarning, DeprecationWarning, SyntaxWarning</tt>, and <tt>RuntimeWarning</tt>. These are described in further detail in <a class="docLink" href="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a>.</P>
<p class="docText">The next component is the warnings filter. There are different warnings of different levels and severities, and somehow the number and type of warnings should be controllable. The warnings filter not only collects information <a name="iddle1464"></a><a name="iddle2394"></a><a name="iddle2403"></a><a name="iddle2958"></a><a name="iddle3070"></a><a name="iddle4566"></a>about the warning, such as line number, cause of the warning, etc., but it also controls whether warnings are ignored, displayedthey can be custom-formattedor turned into errors (generating an exception).</P>
<p class="docText">Warnings have a default output to <tt>sys.stderr</tt>, but there are hooks to be able to change that, for example, to log it instead of displaying it to the end-user while running Python scripts subject to issued warnings. There is also an API to manipulate warning filters.</P>
<p class="docText">Finally, there are the command-line arguments that control the warning filters. These come in the form of options to the Python interpreter upon startup via the -<tt>W</tt> option. See the Python documentation or PEP 230 for the specific switches for your version of Python. The warning framework first appeared in <a class="docLink" href="ch05lev1sec2.html#ch05lev3sec1">Python 2.1</a>.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDABXXUD" class="docSection2Title">12.5.7. Importing Modules from ZIP Files</h4>
<p class="docText">In version 2.3, the feature that allows the import of modules contained inside ZIP archives was added to Python. If you add a <tt>.zip</tt> file containing Python modules (<tt>.py, .pyc</tt>, or <tt>.pyo</tt> files) to your search path, i.e., <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> or <tt>sys.path</tt>, the importer will search that archive for the module as if the ZIP file was a directory.</P>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084202" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/2_3.jpg"></p>


<p class="docText">If a ZIP file contains just a <tt>.py</tt> for any imported module, Python will not attempt to modify the archive by adding the corresponding <tt>.pyc</tt> file, meaning that if a ZIP archive does not contain a matching <tt>.pyc</tt> file, import speed should be expected to be slower than if they were present.</P>
<p class="docText">You are also allowed to add specific (sub)directories &quot;under&quot; a <tt>.zip</tt> file, i.e., <tt>/tmp/yolk.zip/lib/</tt> would only import from the <tt>lib/</tt> subdirectory within the <tt>yolk</tt> archive. Although this feature is specified in PEP 273, the actual implementation uses the import hooks provided by PEP 302.</p>

<a name="ch12lev2sec17"></a>
<H4 id="title-IDA1QEVD" class="docSection2Title">12.5.8. &quot;New&quot; Import Hooks</h4>
<p class="docText">The import of modules inside ZIP archives was &quot;the first customer&quot; of the new import hooks specified by PEP 302. Although we use the word &quot;new,&quot; that is relative considering that it has been difficult to create custom importers because the only way to accomplish this before was to use the other modules that were either really old or didn't simplify writing importers. Another solution is to override <tt>__import__()</tt>, but that is not an easy thing to do because you have to pretty much (re)implement the entire import mechanism.</P>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084202" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/2_3.jpg"></P>


<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2197"></a><a name="iddle2364"></a><a name="iddle2378"></a><a name="iddle2387"></a><a name="iddle2937"></a><a name="iddle4113"></a>The new import hooks, introduced in <a class="docLink" href="ch05lev1sec2.html#ch05lev3sec3">Python 2.3</a>, simplify it down to writing callable import classes, and getting them &quot;registered&quot; (or rather, &quot;installed&quot;) with the Python interpreter via the <tt>sys</tt> module.</p>
<p class="docText">There are two classes that you need: a finder and a loader. An instance of these classes takes an argumentthe full name of any module or package. A finder instance will look for your module, and if it finds it, return a loader object. The finder can also take a path for finding subpackages. The loader is what eventually brings the module into memory, doing whatever it needs to do to make a real Python module object, which is eventually returned by the loader.</p>
<p class="docText">These instances are added to <tt>sys.path_hooks</tt>. The <tt>sys.path_importer_ cache</tt> just holds the instances so that <tt>path_hooks</tt> is traversed only once. Finally, <tt>sys.meta_path</tt> is a list of instances that should be traversed before looking at <tt>sys.path</tt>, for modules whose location you know and do not need to find. The meta-path already has the loader objects reader to execute for specific modules or packages.</p>
