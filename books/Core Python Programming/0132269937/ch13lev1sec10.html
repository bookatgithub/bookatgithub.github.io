<p class="docText">Composition works fine when classes are distinct and are a required component of larger classes, but when you desire &quot;the same class but with some tweaking,&quot; derivation is a more logical option.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the more powerful aspects of OOP is the ability to take an already defined class and extend it or make modifications to it without affecting other pieces of code in the system that use the currently existing classes. OOD allows for class features to be inherited by descendant classes or subclasses. These subclasses derive the core of their attributes from base (aka ancestor, super) <span class="docEmphasis">classes</span>. In addition, this derivation may be extended for multiple generations. Classes involved in a one-level derivation (or that are adjacent vertically in a class tree diagram) have a <span class="docEmphasis">parent</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">child</span> class relationship. Those classes that derive from the same parent (or that are adjacent horizontally in a class tree diagram) have a sibling relationship. Parent and all higher-level classes are considered <span class="docEmphasis">ancestors</span>.</P>
<p class="docText">Using our example from the previous section, let us imagine having to create different types of address books. We are talking about more than just creating multiple instances of address booksin this case, all objects have <a name="iddle1079"></a><a name="iddle4071"></a>everything in common. What if we wanted a <tt>EmplAddrBookEntry</tt> class whose entries would contain more work-related attributes such as employee ID and e-mail address? This would differ from a <tt>PersonalAddrBookEntry</tt> class, which would contain more family-oriented information such as home address, relationship, birthday, etc.</P>
<p class="docText">For both of these cases, we do not want to design these classes from scratch, because it would duplicate the work already accomplished to create the generic <tt>AddressBook</tt> class. Wouldn't it be nice to subsume all the features and characteristics of the <tt>AddressBook</tt> class and add specialized customization for your new, yet related, classes? This is the entire motivation and desire for class derivation.</P>

<H4 id="title-IDATJXZH" class="docSection2Title">13.10.1. Creating Subclasses</h4>
<p class="docText">The syntax for creating a subclass looks just like that for a regular (new-style) class, a class name followed by one or more parent classes to inherit from:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre> <span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> <span class="docEmphasis">SubClassName</span> (<span class="docEmphasis">ParentClass1</span>[, <span class="docEmphasis">ParentClass2</span>, ...]):
    'optional class documentation string'
    <span class="docEmphasis">class_suite</span></pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">If your class does not derive from any ancestor class, use <tt>object</tt> as the name of the parent class. The only example that differs is the declaration of a classic class that does not derive from ancestor classesin this case, there are no parentheses:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> ClassicClassWithoutSuperclasses:
    <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span></pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">We have already seen some examples of classes and subclasses so far, but here is another simple example:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> Parent(object):         # define parent class
     <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> parentMethod(self):

        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'calling parent method'
<span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> Child(Parent):          # define child class
     <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> childMethod(self):
         <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'calling child method'
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Parent()              # instance of parent
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.parentMethod()
calling parent method
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Child()               # instance of child
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.childMethod()           # child calls its method
calling child method
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.parentMethod()          # calls parent's method
calling parent method</pre></div><br>
