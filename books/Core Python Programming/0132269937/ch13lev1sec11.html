<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2412"></a><span class="docEmphasis">Inheritance</span> describes how the attributes of base classes are &quot;bequeathed&quot; to a derived class. A subclass inherits attributes of any of its base classes whether they be data attributes or methods.</p>
<p class="docText">We present an example below. <tt>P</tt> is a simple class with no attributes. <tt>C</tt> is a class with no attributes that derives from (and therefore is a subclass of) <tt>P</tt>:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> P(object):         # parent class
     <span class="docEmphStrong">pass
class</span> C(P):              # child class
     <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span>

&gt;&gt;&gt; c.__class__          # child "is a" parent
&lt;class '__main__.C'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.__bases__          # child's parent class(es)
(&lt;class '__main__.P'&gt;,)</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">Because <tt>P</tt> has no attributes, nothing was inherited by <tt>C</tt>. Let us make our example more useful by giving <tt>P</tt> some attributes:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> P:                     # parent class
    'P class'
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> __init__(self):

            self.__class__.__name__

<span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> C(P):               # child class
    <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span></pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">We now create <tt>P</tt> with a documentation string (<tt>__doc__</tt>) and a constructor that will execute when we instantiate <tt>P</tt>, as in this interactive session:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; p = P()                       # parent instance
    created an instance of P

    'P class'</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">The &quot;created an instance&quot; output comes directly from <tt>__init__()</tt>. We also display some more about the parent class P for your information.

<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()               # child instance

    &gt;&gt;&gt;</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText"><tt>C</tt> has no declared method <tt>__init__()</tt>, yet there is still output when instance <tt>c</tt> of class <tt>C</tt> is created. The reason is that <tt>C</tt> inherits <tt>__init__()</tt> from <tt>P</tt>. The <tt>__bases__</tt> tuple now lists <tt>P</tt> as its parent class. Note that documentation strings are unique to classes, functions/methods, and modules, so a special attribute like <tt>__doc__</tt> is not inherited by its derived classes.</p>

<H4 id="title-IDAZV5VD" class="docSection2Title">13.11.1. <tt>__bases__</tt> Class Attribute</h4>
<p class="docText">In <a class="docLink" href="ch13lev1sec4.html#ch13lev2sec17">Section 13.4.4</a>, we briefly introduced the <tt>__bases__</tt> class attribute, which is a tuple containing the set of parent classes for any (sub)class. Note that we specifically state &quot;parents&quot; as opposed to all base classes (which includes all ancestor classes). Classes that are not derived will have an empty <tt>__bases__</tt> attribute. Let us look at an example of how to make use of <tt>__bases__</tt>.</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> A(object): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span>  # define class A

    &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> B(A): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span>       # subclass of A
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> C(B): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span>       # subclass of B (and indirectly, A)
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> D(A, B): <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span>    # subclass of A and B

<p class="docText">In the example above, although <tt>C</tt> is a derived class of both <tt>A</tt> (tHRough <tt>B</tt>) and <tt>B</tt>, <tt>C</tt>'s parent is <tt>B</tt>, as indicated in its declaration, so only <tt>B</tt> will show up in <tt>C.__bases__</tt>.

<h4 id="title-IDABZ5VD" class="docSection2Title">13.11.2. Overriding Methods through Inheritance</h4>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2417"></a><a name="iddle2427"></a><a name="iddle2872"></a><a name="iddle3377"></a>Let us create another function in P that we will override in its child class:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> P(object):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo(self):
        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'Hi, I am P-foo()'

&gt;&gt;&gt; p = P()
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.foo()
Hi, I am P-foo()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Now let us create the child class <tt>C</tt>, subclassed from parent <tt>P</tt>:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> C(P):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo(self):
        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'Hi, I am C-foo()'

&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.foo()
Hi, I am C-foo()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Although <tt>C</tt> inherits <tt>P</tt>'s <tt>foo()</tt> method, it is overridden because <tt>C</tt> defines its own <tt>foo()</tt> method. One reason for overriding methods is because you may want special or different functionality in your subclass. Your next obvious question then must be, &quot;Can I call a base class method that I overrode in my subclass?&quot;</p>
<p class="docText">The answer is yes, but this is where you will have to invoke an unbound base class method, explicitly providing the instance of the subclass, as we do here:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; P.foo(c)
    Hi, I am P-foo()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Notice that we already had an instance of <tt>P</tt> called <tt>p</tt> from above, but that is nowhere to be found in this example. We do not need an instance of <tt>P</tt> to call a method of <tt>P</tt> because we have an instance of a <span class="docEmphasis">subclass</span> of <tt>P</tt> which we can use, <tt>c</tt>. You would not typically call the parent class method this way. Instead, you would do it in the overridden method and call the base class method explicitly:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> C(P):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo(self):
        P.foo(self)
        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'Hi, I am C-foo()'</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle3713"></a>Note how we pass in <tt>self</tt> explicitly in this (unbound) method call. A better way to make this call would be to use the <tt>super()</tt> built-in method:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> C(P):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> foo(self):
        super(C, self).foo()
        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'Hi, I am C-foo()'</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText"><tt>super()</tt> will not only find the base class method, but pass in <tt>self</tt> for us so we do not have to as in the previous example. Now when we call the child class method, it does exactly what you think it should do:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c.foo()
    Hi, I am P-foo()
    Hi, I am C-foo()</pre></div><br>

<H4 id="title-IDAJU55H" class="docSection2Title">13.11.3. Deriving Standard Types</H4>
<p class="docText">Not being able to subclass a standard data type was one of the most significant problems of classic classes. Fortunately that was remedied back in 2.2 with the unification of types and classes and the introduction of new-style classes. Below we present two examples of subclassing a Python type, one mutable and the other not.</P>

<h5 id="title-IDACV55H" class="docSection3Title">Immutable Type Example</h5>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2361"></a><a name="iddle3020"></a>Let us assume you wanted to work on a subclass of floating point numbers to be used for financial applications. Any time you get a monetary value (as a float), you always want to round evenly to two decimal places. (Yes, the <tt>Decimal</tt> class is a better solution than standard floats to accurately store floating point values, but you still need to round them [occasionally] to two digits!) The beginnings of your class can look like this:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> RoundFloat(float):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> __new__(cls, val):
        <span class="docEmphStrong">return</span> float.__new__(cls, round(val, 2))</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">We override the <tt>__new__()</tt> special method, which customizes our object to be just a little bit different from the standard Python float: we round the original floating point number using the <tt>round()</tt> built-in function and then instantiate our float, <tt>RoundFloat</tt>. We create the actual object by calling our parent class constructor, <tt>float.__new__()</tt>. Note that all <tt>__new__()</tt> methods are class methods, and we have to explicitly pass in the class as the first argument, similar to how <tt>self</tt> is required for regular methods like <tt>__init__()</tt>.</P>
<p class="docText">While our example is simple enough, i.e., we know we have a float, we are only subclassing from one type, etc., for general cases, it is better to use the <tt>super()</tt> built-in function to go and hunt down the appropriate superclass <tt>__new__()</tt> method to call. Below, we have modified our example with this change:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> RoundFloat(float):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> __new__(cls, val):
        <span class="docEmphStrong">return</span> super(RoundFloat, cls).__new__(
            cls, round(val, 2))</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">This example is far from complete, so keep an eye out for getting it in better shape as we progress through this chapter. Here is some sample output:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; RoundFloat(1.5955)
    1.6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; RoundFloat(1.5945)
    1.59
    &gt;&gt;&gt; RoundFloat(-1.9955)
    -2.0</pre></div><BR>

<a name="ch13lev3sec17"></a>
<H5 id="title-IDAGY55H" class="docSection3Title">Mutable Type Example</h5>
<p class="docText">Subclassing a mutable type is similar, and you probably do not need to use <tt>__new__()</tt> (or even <tt>__init__()</tt>) because there is typically not as much <a name="iddle2416"></a><a name="iddle2987"></a><a name="iddle4074"></a>setup required. Usually the default behavior of the type you are deriving is what you want. In this simple example, we create a new dictionary type where its keys are returned sorted by the <tt>keys()</tt> method:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> SortedKeyDict(dict):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> keys(self):
        <span class="docEmphStrong">return</span> sorted(super(
            SortedKeyDict, self).keys())</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Recall that a dictionary can be created with <tt>dict()</tt>, <tt>dict(mapping)</tt>, <tt>dict(sequence_of_2_tuples)</tt>, or <tt>dict(**kwargs)</tt>. Below is an example of using our new class:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>d = SortedKeyDict((('zheng-cai', 67), ('hui-jun', 68),
      ('xin-yi', 2)))
<span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'By iterator:'.ljust(12), [key  <span class="docEmphStrong">for</span> key  <span class="docEmphStrong">in</span> d]
<span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'By keys():'.ljust(12), d.keys()</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">If we put all the code in a script and run it, we get the following output:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    By iterator: ['zheng-cai', 'xin-yi', 'hui-jun']
    By keys():   ['xin-yi', 'hui-jun', 'zheng-cai']</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">For our example, the iterator progresses through the keys in the hashed order while using our (overridden) <tt>keys()</tt> method gives the keys in lexicographically sorted order.</P>
<p class="docText">Always be cautious and conscious of what you are doing. What if, you say, &quot;Your method is overly complicated with the call to <tt>super()</tt>,&quot; and instead, you prefer <tt>keys()</tt> to be simpler (and easier to understand)... like this:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> keys(self):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">return</span> sorted(self.keys())</pre></div><br>

<H4 id="title-IDAU255H" class="docSection2Title">13.11.4. Multiple Inheritance</H4>
<p class="docText">Like C++, Python allows for subclassing from multiple base classes. This feature is commonly known as <span class="docEmphasis">multiple inheritance</span>. The concept is easy, but the hard work is in how to find the correct attribute when it is not defined in the current (sub)class. There are two different aspects to remember when using multiple inheritance. The first is, again, being able to find the correct attribute. Another is when you have overridden methods, all of which call parent class methods to &quot;take care of their responsibilities&quot; while the child class takes care of <span class="docEmphasis">its</span> own obligations. We will discuss both simultaneously but focus on the latter as we describe the <span class="docEmphasis">method resolution order</span>.</p>

Unlike other Python algorithms that override names as they are found, multiple inheritance takes the first name that is found.</p>
<p class="docText">Because of the entirely new structure of classes and types and the subclassing of built-in types, this algorithm was no longer feasible, so a new MRO algorithm had to be developed. The initial one debuting in 2.2 was a good attempt but had a flaw (see Core Note below). It was immediately replaced in 2.3, which is the current one that is in use today.</p>

<H5 id="title-IDA0FD1D" class="docSection4Title">Classic Classes</h5>
<p class="docText">We are going to use classic classes first. Upon executing the above declarations in the interactive interpreter, we can confirm the resolution order that classic classes use, depth-first, left to right:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; gc = GC()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; gc.foo()       # GC <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> C1 <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> P1
    called P1-foo()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; gc.bar()       # GC <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> C1 <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> P1 <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> P2
    called P2-bar()</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">When calling <tt>foo()</tt>, it looks in the current class (<tt>GC</tt>) first. If it cannot be found, it goes up to its immediate parent, <tt>C1</tt>. The search fails there so it continues up the tree to <span class="docEmphasis">its</span> parent, <tt>P1</tt>, which is where <tt>foo()</tt> is found.</p>
<p class="docText">Likewise for <tt>bar()</tt>, it searches through <tt>GC</tt>, <tt>C1</tt>, and <tt>P1</tt> before then finding it in <tt>P2</tt>. <tt>C2.bar()</tt> is never found because of the resolution order used. <a name="iddle1390"></a><a name="iddle1647"></a><a name="iddle2415"></a><a name="iddle2924"></a>Now, you may be thinking, &quot;I would prefer to call <tt>C2</tt>'s <tt>bar()</tt> because it is closer to me in the inheritance tree, thus more relevant.&quot; In this case, you can still use it, but you have to do it in the typical unbound fashion by invoking its fully qualified name and providing a valid instance:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; C2.bar(gc)
    called C2-bar()</pre></div><br>

<a name="ch13lev4sec2"></a>
<h5 id="title-IDAVID1D" class="docSection4Title">New-Style Classes</H5>
<p class="docText">Now uncomment the (object) next to the class declarations for <tt>P1</tt> and <tt>P2</tt> and reexecute. The new-style method resolution gives us something different:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; gc = GC()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; gc.foo()        # GC <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> C1 <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> C2 <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> P1
    called P1-foo()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; gc.bar()        # GC <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> C1 <img src=images/U21D2.jpg border=0> C2
    called C2-bar()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Instead of following the tree up each step, it looks at the siblings first, giving it more of a breadth-first flavor. When looking for <tt>foo()</tt>, it checks GC, followed by C1 and C2, and then finds it in P1. If P1 did not have it, it would have gone to <tt>P2</tt>. The bottom line for <tt>foo()</tt> is that both classic and new-style classes would have found it in <tt>P1</tt>, but they took different paths to get there.</P>
<p class="docText">The result for <tt>bar()</tt> is different, though. It searches <tt>GC</tt> and <tt>C1</tt>, and finds it next in <tt>C2</tt> and uses it there. It does not continue up to the grandparents <tt>P1</tt> and <tt>P2</tt>. In this case, the new-style resolution fit into the scheme better if you did prefer to call the &quot;closest&quot; <tt>bar()</tt> from <tt>GC</tt>. And of course, if you still need to call one higher up, just do it in an unbound manner as before:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; P2.bar(gc)
    called P2-bar()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">New-style classes also have an <tt>__mro__</tt> attribute that tells you what the search order is:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>   &gt;&gt;&gt; GC.__mro__
   (&lt;class '__main__.GC'&gt;, &lt;class '__main__.C1'&gt;, &lt;class
   '__main__.C2'&gt;, &lt;class '__main__.P1'&gt;, &lt;class
   '__main__.P2'&gt;, &lt;type 'object'&gt;)</pre></div><BR>

<H5 id="title-IDACLD1D" class="docSection3Title">*MRO Problems Caused by Diamonds</h5>
<p class="docText">The classic class method resolution never gave folks too many problems. It was simple to explain and easy to understand. Most classes were single inheritance, and multiple inheritance was usually limited to mixing two completely discrete classes together. This is where the term <span class="docEmphasis">mix-in</span> classes (or &quot;mix-ins&quot;) comes from.</p>
<a name="ch13lev4sec3"></a>

<h5 id="title-IDASLD1D" class="docSection4Title">Why the Classic Classes MRO Fails</h5>
<p class="docText">The unification of types and classes in 2.2 brought about a new &quot;problem,&quot; and that is related to all (root) classes inheriting from <tt>object</tt>, the mother of all types. The diagram of a simple multiple inheritance hierarchy now formed a diamond. Taking some inspiration from Guido van Rossum's essay, let us say that you have classic classes B and C, as defined below where C overrides its constructor but B does not, and D inherits from both B and C:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> B:
    <span class="docEmphStrong">pass

class</span> C:
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> __init__(self):
        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> "the default constructor"

<span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> D(B, C):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span></pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">When we instantiate D, we get:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; d = D()
    the default constructor</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#ch13fig03">Figure 13-3</a> illustrates the class hierarchy for B, C, and D, as well as the problem introduced when we change the code to use new-style classes:</p>
<a name="ch13fig03"></a><p><center>

<h5 class="docFigureTitle">Figure 13-3. Inheritance problems are caused by the appearance of the base class required by new-style classes, forming a diamond shape in the inheritance hierarchy. An instance of <tt>D</tt> should not miss an upcall to <tt>C</tt> nor should it upcall to <tt>A</tt> twice (since both <tt>B</tt> and <tt>C</tt> derive from <tt>A</tt>). Be sure to read the &quot;Cooperative Methods&quot; section of Guido van Rossum's essay for further clarification.</h5>

<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> B(object):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">pass

class</span> C(object):
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> __init__(self):
        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> "the default constructor"</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Not much change here other than adding (object) to both class declarations, right? That is true, but as you can see in the diagram, the hierarchy is now a diamond; the real problem is in the MRO now. If we used the classic <a name="iddle1377"></a><a name="iddle1744"></a><a name="iddle2185"></a><a name="iddle2190"></a><a name="iddle2203"></a><a name="iddle2461"></a><a name="iddle2555"></a><a name="iddle3169"></a>class MRO, when instantiating <tt>D</tt>, we no longer get <tt>C.__init__()</tt>... we get <tt>object.__init__()</tt>! This is the exact reason why the MRO needed to be changed.</P>
<p class="docText">Although we saw that it does change the way attributes are looked up in our example above with the GC class, you do not have to worry about lots of code breaking. Classic classes will still use the old MRO while new-style classes will use its MRO. Again, if you do not need all of the features of the new-style classes, there is nothing wrong with continuing to develop using classic classes.</p>

<H5 id="title-IDAVRD1D" class="docSection3Title">Summary</h5>
<p class="docText">Classic classes have a depth-first MRO algorithm. Because new-style classes inherit from object, a new MRO had to be created because of problems ensuing from the now-diamond-shaped class hierarchy.</P>
