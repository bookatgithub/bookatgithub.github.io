In other words, instances are classes brought to life. Once a blueprint is provided, the next step to bring them to fruition. Instances are the objects that are used primarily during execution, and the types of all instances are the class from which they were instantiated. Prior to <a class="docLink" href="ch05lev1sec2.html#ch05lev3sec2">Python 2.2</a>, instances were &quot;instance types,&quot; regardless of which class they came from.</p>

<H4 id="title-IDASHB1D" class="docSection2Title">13.5.1. Instantiation: Creating Instances by Invoking Class Object</H4>
<p class="docText">Many other OO languages provide a <tt>new</tt> keyword with which to create an instance of a class. Python's approach is much simpler. Once a class has been defined, creating an instance is no more difficult than calling a functionliterally. Instantiation is realized with use of the function operator, as in the following example:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> MyClass(object):   # define class
    ...     <span class="docEmphStrong">pass</span>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; mc = MyClass()           # instantiate class</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">As you can see, creating instance <tt>mc</tt> of class <tt>MyClass</tt> consists of &quot;calling&quot; the class: <tt>MyClass()</tt>. The returned object is an instance of the class you called. When you &quot;call&quot; a class using the functional notation, the interpreter instantiates the object, and calls the closest thing Python has to a constructor (if you have written one [see the next section]) to perform any final customization such as setting instance attributes, and finally returns the instance to you.</p>

<H4 id="title-IDA4MB1D" class="docSection2Title">13.5.2. <tt>__init__()</tt> &quot;Constructor&quot; Method</h4>
<p class="docText">When the class is invoked, the first step in the instantiation process is to create the instance object. Once the object is available, Python checks if an <tt>__init__()</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">method</span> has been implemented. By default, no special actions are enacted on the instance without the definition of (or the overriding) of the special method <tt>__init__()</tt>. Any special action desired requires the programmer to implement <tt>__init__()</tt>, overriding its default behavior. If <tt>__init__()</tt> has not been implemented, the object is then returned and the instantiation process is complete.</p>
<p class="docText">However, if <tt>__init__()</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">has</span> been implemented, then that special method is invoked and the instance object passed in as the first argument (<tt>self</tt>), just like a standard method call. Any arguments passed to the class invocation call are passed on to <tt>__init__()</tt>. You can practically envision the call to create the instance as a call to the constructor.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1630"></a><a name="iddle1645"></a><a name="iddle2469"></a><a name="iddle2480"></a><a name="iddle3068"></a>In summary, (a) you do not call <tt>new</tt> to create an instance, and you do not define a constructor: Python creates the object for you; and (b) <tt>__init__()</tt>, is simply the first method that is called after the interpreter creates an instance for you in case you want to prep the object a little bit more before putting it to use.</P>
<p class="docText"><tt>__init__()</tt> is one of many special methods that can be defined for classes. Some of these special methods are predefined with inaction as their default behavior, such as <tt>__init__()</tt>, and must be overridden for customization while others should be implemented on an as-needed basis. We will cover many more of these special methods throughout this chapter. You will find use of <tt>__init__()</tt> everywhere, so we will not present an example here.</P>

<a name="ch13lev2sec20"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAVPB1D" class="docSection2Title">13.5.3. <tt>__new__()</tt> &quot;Constructor&quot; Method</h4>
<p class="docText">The <tt>__new__()</tt> special method bears a much closer resemblance to a real constructor than <tt>__init__()</tt>. With the unification of types and classes in 2.2, Python users now have the ability to subclass built-in types, and so there needed to be a way to instantiate immutable objects, e.g., subclassing strings, numbers, etc.</p>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" width="50" height="48" SRC="images/2_2.jpg"></p>


<p class="docText">In such cases, the interpreter calls <tt>__new__()</tt>, a static method, with the class and passing in the arguments made in the class instantiation call. It is the responsibility of <tt>__new__()</tt> to call a superclass <tt>__new__()</tt> to create the object (delegating upward).</p>
<p class="docText">The reason why we say that <tt>__new__()</tt> is more like a constructor than <tt>__init__()</tt> is that it has to return a valid instance so that the interpreter can then call <tt>__init__()</tt> with that instance as self. Calling a superclass <tt>__new__()</tt> to create the object is just like using a <tt>new</tt> keyword to create an object in other languages.</p>
<p class="docText"><tt>__new__()</tt> and <tt>__init__()</tt> are both passed the (same) arguments as in the class creation call. For an example of using <tt>__new__()</tt>, see <a class="docLink" href="ch13lev1sec11.html#ch13lev2sec34">Section 13.11.3</a>.</p>

<a name="ch13lev2sec21"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDA1RB1D" class="docSection2Title">13.5.4. <tt>__del__()</tt> &quot;Destructor&quot; Method</h4>
<p class="docText">Likewise, there is an equivalent <span class="docEmphasis">destructor</span> special method called <tt>__del__()</tt>. However, due to the way Python manages garbage collection of objects (by reference counting), this function is not executed until all references to an instance object have been removed. Destructors in Python are methods that provide special processing before instances are deallocated and <span class="docEmphasis">are not commonly implemented</span> since instances are seldom deallocated explicitly. If you do override <tt>__del__()</tt>, be sure to call any parent class <tt>__del__()</tt> first so those pieces can be adequately deallocated.</p>
<a name="ch13lev3sec9"></a>

<h5 id="title-IDAUSB1D" class="docSection3Title">Example</h5>
<p class="docText">In the following example, we create (and override) both the <tt>__init__()</tt> and <tt>__del__()</tt> constructor and destructor functions, respectively, then instantiate the class and assign more aliases to the same object. The <tt>id()</tt> built-in function is then used to confirm that all three aliases reference the same object. The final step is to remove all the aliases by using the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>del</tt></span> statement and discovering when and how many times the destructor is called.</P>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> C(P):              # class declaration
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> __init__(self):          # "constructor"
         <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'initialized'
    <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> __del__(self):           # "destructor"
         P.__del__(self)    # call parent destructor
         <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'deleted'

&gt;&gt;&gt; c1 = C()               # instantiation
initialized
&gt;&gt;&gt; c2 = c1                # create additional alias
&gt;&gt;&gt; c3 = c1                # create a third alias
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(c1), id(c2), id(c3)  # all refer to same object
(11938912, 11938912, 11938912)
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">del</span> c1              # remove one reference
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">del</span> c2              # remove another reference
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">del</span> c3              # remove final reference
deleted                      # destructor finally invoked</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Notice how, in the above example, the destructor was not called until all references to the instance of class <tt>C</tt> were removed, e.g., when the reference count has decreased to zero. If for some reason your <tt>__del__()</tt> method is not being called when you are expecting it to be invoked, this means that somehow your instance object's reference count is not zero, and there may be some other reference to it that you are not aware of that is keeping your object around.</P>
<p class="docText">Also note that the destructor is called exactly once, the first time the reference count goes to zero and the object deallocated. This makes sense because any object in the system is allocated and deallocated only once. Summary:</p>

</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Python does not provide any internal mechanism to track how many instances of a class have been created or to keep tabs on what they are.
