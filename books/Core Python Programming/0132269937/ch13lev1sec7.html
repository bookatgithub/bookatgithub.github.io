<p class="docText">Now we need to readdress the Python concept of binding, which is associated primarily with method invocation. We will first review some facts regarding methods. First, a method is simply a function defined as part of a class. (This means that methods are class attributes and not instance attributes).</p>
<p class="docText">Second, methods can be called only when there is an instance of the class upon which the method was invoked. When there is an instance present, the method is considered <span class="docEmphasis">bound</span> (to that instance). Without an instance, a method is considered unbound.</P>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1224"></a><a name="iddle3712"></a><a name="iddle4324"></a>And finally, the first argument in any method definition is the variable <tt>self</tt>, which represents the instance object invoking the method.</P>

<h4 id="title-IDAZBFVD" class="docSection2Title">13.7.1. Invoking Bound Methods</h4>
<p class="docText">Methods, whether bound or not, are made up of the same code. The only difference is whether there is an instance present so that the method can be invoked. In most cases, you the programmer will be calling a bound method. Let us say that you have a class <tt>MyClass</tt> and an instance of it called <tt>mc</tt>, and you want to call the <tt>MyClass.foo()</tt> method. Since you already have an instance, you can just call the method with <tt>mc.foo()</tt>. Recall that <tt>self</tt> is required to be declared as the first argument in every method declaration. Well, when you call a bound method, <tt>self</tt> never needs to be passed explicitly when you invoke it with an instance. That is your bonus for being &quot;required&quot; to declare <tt>self</tt> as the first argument. The only time when you have to pass it in is when you do not have an instance and need to call a method unbound.</p>

<a name="ch13lev2sec28"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAUCFVD" class="docSection2Title">13.7.2. Invoking Unbound Methods</H4>
<p class="docText">Calling an unbound method happens less frequently. The main use case for calling a method belonging to a class that you do not have an instance for is the case where you are deriving a child class and override a parent method where you need to call the parent's constructor you are overriding. Let us look at an example back in the chapter introduction:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphStrong">class</span> EmplAddrBookEntry(AddrBookEntry):
        'Employee Address Book Entry class'
        <span class="docEmphStrong">def</span> __init__(self, nm, ph, em):
             AddrBookEntry.__init__(self, nm, ph)
             self.empid = id
             self.email = em</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1398"></a><a name="iddle2875"></a><a name="iddle3962"></a><tt>EmplAddrBookEntry</tt> is a subclass of <tt>AddrBookEntry</tt>, and we are overriding the constructor <tt>__init__()</tt>. Rather than cutting and pasting code from the parent constructor, we want to have as much code reuse as possible. This will also prevent bugs from being propagated because any fixes made would be propagated to us here in the child. This is exactly what we wantthere is no need to copy lines of code. This all hinges on somehow being able to call the parent constructor, but how?</P>
<p class="docText">We would not have an instance of <tt>AddrBookEntry</tt> at runtime. What do we have? Well, we will have an instance of <tt>EmplAddrBookEntry</tt>, and it is so similar to <tt>AddrBookEntry</tt>, can't we somehow use it instead? The answer is yes!</p>
<p class="docText">When an <tt>EmplAddrBookEntry</tt> is instantiated and <tt>__init__()</tt> called, there is very little difference between it and an instance of <tt>AddrBookEntry</tt>, mainly because we have not yet had a chance to customize our <tt>EmplAddrBookEntry</tt> instance to really make it different from <tt>AddrBookEntry</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText">This is the perfect place to call an unbound method. We will call the parent class constructor from the child class constructor and explicitly pass in the <tt>self</tt> argument as required by the (parent class) constructor (since we are without a parent class instance). The first line of <tt>__init__()</tt> in the child consists of a call to <tt>__init__()</tt> of the parent. We call it via the parent class name and pass in <tt>self</tt> plus its required arguments. Once that call returns, we can perform the (instance) customization that is unique to our (child) class.</p>
