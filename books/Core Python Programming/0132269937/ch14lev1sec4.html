<p class="docText">When we discuss the execution of other programs, we distinguish between Python programs and all other non-Python programs, which include binary executables or other scripting language source code. We will cover how to run other Python programs first, then how to use the <tt>os</tt> module to invoke external programs.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1907"></a><a name="iddle2373"></a><a name="iddle2382"></a><a name="iddle2946"></a>During runtime, there are a number of ways to execute another Python script. As we discussed earlier, importing a module the first time will cause the code at the top level of that module to execute. This is the behavior of Python importing, whether desired or not. We remind you that the only code that belongs to the top level of a module are global variables, and class and function declarations.</P>
<a name="ch14note01"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">Core Note: All modules executed when imported</P><p><table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td width="60" valign="top"><img border="0" alt="" align="LEFT" width="50" height="50" SRC="images/core_note.jpg">


</TD><td valign="top"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">This is just a friendly reminder: As already alluded to earlier in Chapters <a class="docLink" href="ch03.html#ch03">3</a> and <a class="docLink" href="ch12.html#ch12">12</a>, we will tell you one more time that</span> Python modules are executed when they are imported! <span class="docEmphasis">When you import the <tt>foo</tt> module, it runs all of the top-level (not indented) Python code, i.e., &quot;main()&quot;. If <tt>foo</tt> contains a declaration for the <tt>bar</tt> function, then <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>def</tt></span> <tt>foo(...)</tt> is executed. Why is that again?</span></P><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Well, just think what needs to be done in order for the call</span> <tt>foo.bar()</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">to succeed. Somehow</span> <tt>bar</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">has to be recognized as a valid name in the</span> <tt>foo</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">module (and in</span> <tt>foo</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">'s namespace), and second, the interpreter needs to know it is a declared function, just like any other function in your local module.</span></p><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Now that we know what we need to do, what do we do with code that we do not want executed every time our module is imported? Indent it and put it in the suite for the</span> <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>if</tt></span> <tt>__name__ == '__main__'</tt>.</P></td></TR></table></P></div><br>
<p class="docText">These should be followed by an <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>if</tt></span> statement that checks <tt>__name__</tt> to determine if a script is invoked, i.e., &quot;<span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>if</tt></span><tt>__name__ == '__main__'</tt>&quot;. In these cases, your script can then execute the main body of code, or, if this script was meant to be imported, it can run a test suite for the code in this module.</p>
<p class="docText">One complication arises when the imported module itself contains <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>import</tt></span> statements. If the modules in these <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>import</tt></span> statements have not been loaded yet, they will be loaded and their top-level code executed, resulting in recursive import behavior. We present a simple example below. We have two modules <tt>import1</tt> and <tt>import2</tt>, both with <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>print</tt></span> statements at their outermost level. <tt>import1</tt> imports <tt>import2</tt> so that when we import <tt>import1</tt> from within Python, it imports and &quot;executes&quot; <tt>import2</tt> as well.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1888"></a>Here are the contents of <tt>import1.py</tt>:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    # import1.py
    <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'loaded import1'
    <span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> import2</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">And here are the contents of <tt>import2.py</tt>:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    # import2.py
   <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'loaded import2'</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Here is the output when we import <tt>import1</tt> from Python:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> import1
    loaded import1
    loaded import2
    &gt;&gt;&gt;</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Following our suggested workaround of checking the value of <tt>__name__</tt>, we can change the code in <tt>import1.py</tt> and <tt>import2.py</tt> so that this behavior does not occur.</p>
<p class="docText">Here is the modified version of <tt>import1.py</tt>:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    # import1.py
    <span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> import2
    <span class="docEmphStrong">if</span> __name__ == '__main__':
         <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'loaded import1'</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">The following is the code for <tt>import2.py</tt>, changed in the same manner:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>    # import2.py
    <span class="docEmphStrong">if</span> __name__ == '__main__'
        <span class="docEmphStrong">print</span> 'loaded import2'</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">We no longer get any output when we import <tt>import1</tt> from Python:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> import1
    &gt;&gt;&gt;</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Now it does not necessarily mean that this is the behavior you should code for all situations. There may be cases where you <span class="docEmphasis">want</span> to display output to confirm a module import. It all depends on your situation. Our goal is to provide pragmatic programming examples to prevent unintended side effects.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDA4CYYH" class="docSection2Title">14.4.2. <tt>execfile()</tt></h4>
<p class="docText">It should seem apparent that importing a module is not the preferred method of executing a Python script from within another Python script; that is not what the importing process is. One side effect of importing a module is the execution of the top-level code.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2945"></a>Earlier in this chapter, we described how the <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>exec</tt></span> statement can be used with a file object argument to read the contents of a Python script and execute it. This can be accomplished with the following code segment:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    f  = open(<span class="docEmphasis">filename</span>, 'r')
    <span class="docEmphStrong">exec</span> f
    f.close()</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">The three lines can be replaced by a single call to <tt>execfile()</tt>:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    execfile(<span class="docEmphasis">filename</span>)</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Although the code above does execute a module, it does so only in its current execution environment (i.e., its global and local namespace). There may be a desire to execute a module with a different set of global and local namespaces instead of the default ones. The full syntax of <tt>execfile()</tt> is very similar to that of <tt>eval()</tt>:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    execfile(<span class="docEmphasis">filename</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">globals</span>=globals(), <span class="docEmphasis">locals</span>=locals())</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">Like <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>eval()</tt></span>, both <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>globals</tt></span> and <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>locals</tt></span> are optional and default to the executing environments' namespaces if not given. If only <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>globals</tt></span> is given, then <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>locals</tt></span> defaults to <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>globals</tt></span>. If provided, <span class="docEmphasis"><tt>locals</tt></span> can be any mapping object [an object defining/overriding <tt>__getitem__()]</tt>, although before 2.4, it was required to be a dictionary. Warning: be very careful with your local namespace (in terms of modifying it). It is much safer to pass in a dummy &quot;locals&quot; dictionary and check for any side effects. Altering the local namespace is not guaranteed by <tt>execfile()</tt>! See the Python Library Reference Manual's entry for <tt>execfile()</tt> for more details.</p>

<H4 id="title-IDAJGYYH" class="docSection2Title">14.4.3. Executing Modules as Scripts</h4>
<p class="docText">A new command-line option (or switch) was added in <a class="docLink" href="ch05lev1sec2.html#ch05lev3sec4">Python 2.4</a> that allows you to directly execute a module as a script from your shell or DOS prompt. When you are writing your own modules as scripts, it is easy to execute them. From your working directory, you would just call your script on the command line:</P>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/2_4.jpg"></p>


<div class="docText"><pre>    $ myScript.py   # or $ python myScript.py</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">This is not as easy if you are dealing with modules that are part of the standard library, installed in site-packages, or just modules in packages, especially if they also share the same name as an existing Python module. For example, let us say you wanted to run the free Web server that comes with Python so that you can create and test Web pages and CGI scripts you wrote.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1468"></a><a name="iddle1908"></a><a name="iddle3109"></a><a name="iddle3467"></a>You would have to type something like the following at the command line:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>    $ python /usr/local/lib/python2x/CGIHTTPServer.py
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">That is a long line to type, and if it is a third-party, you would have to dig into <tt>site-packages</tt> to find exactly where it is located, etc. Can we run a module from the command line without the full pathname and let Python's import mechanism do the legwork for us?</P>
<p class="docText">That answer is yes. We can use the Python <tt>-c</tt> command-line switch:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>    $ python -c "<span class="docEmphStrong">import</span> CGIHTTPServer; CGIHTTPServer.test()"</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">This option allows you to specify a Python statement you wish to run. So it does work, but the problem is that the <tt>__name__</tt> module is not <tt>'__main__'</tt>... it is whatever module name you are using. (You can refer back to <a class="docLink" href="ch03lev1sec4.html#ch03lev2sec16">Section 3.4.1</a> for a review of <tt>__name__</tt> if you need to.) The bottom line is that the interpreter has loaded your module by import and not as a script. Because of this, all of the code under <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>if</tt></span><tt>__name__=='__main__'</tt> will not execute, so you have to do it manually like we did above calling the <tt>test()</tt> function of the module.</p>
<p class="docText">So what we really want is the best of both worldsbeing able to execute a module in your library but as a script and not as an imported module. That is the main motivation behind the <tt>-m</tt> option. Now you can run a script like this:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>    $ python -m CGIHTTPServer</pre></div><BR>

<p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" width="50" height="47" SRC="images/653_01.jpg"></p>


<p class="docText">That is quite an improvement. Still, the feature was not as fully complete as some would have liked. So in Python 2.5, the <tt>-m</tt> switch was given even more capability. Starting with 2.5, you can use the same option to run modules inside packages or modules that need special loading, such as those inside ZIP files, a feature added in 2.3 (see <a class="docLink" href="ch12lev1sec5.html#ch12lev2sec16">Section 12.5.7</a> on page <a class="docLink" href="ch12lev1sec5.html#ch12lev2sec16">396</a>). <a class="docLink" href="ch05lev1sec2.html#ch05lev3sec4">Python 2.4</a> only lets you execute standard library modules. So running special modules like PyChecker (Python's &quot;lint&quot;), the debugger (<tt>pdb</tt>), or any of the profilers (note that these are modules that load and run <span class="docEmphasis">other</span> modules) was not solved with the initial <tt>-m</tt> solution but is fixed in 2.5.</P>
