<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2730"></a>Let's take a look at what the <tt>tHRead</tt> module has to offer. In addition to being able to spawn threads, the <tt>tHRead</tt> module also provides a basic synchronization data structure called a <span class="docEmphasis">lock object</span> (aka primitive lock, simple lock, mutual exclusion lock, mutex, binary semaphore). As we mentioned earlier, such synchronization primitives go hand in hand with thread management.</P>

<p class="docText">The key function of the <tt>thread</tt> module is <tt>start_new_thread()</tt>. Its syntax is exactly that of the <tt>apply()</tt> built-in function, taking a function along with arguments and optional keyword arguments. The difference is that instead of the main thread executing the function, a new thread is spawned to invoke the function.</P>
<p class="docText">Let's take our <tt>onethr.py</tt> example and integrate threading into it. By slightly changing the call to the <tt>loop*()</tt> functions, we now present <tt>mtsleep1.py</tt> in <a class="docLink" href="#ch18list02">Example 18.2</a>.</P>

<p class="docText"><tt>start_new_thread()</tt> requires the first two arguments, so that is the reason for passing in an empty tuple even if the executing function requires no arguments.</P>
<p class="docText">Upon execution of this program, our output changes drastically. Rather than taking a full 6 or 7 seconds, our script now runs in 4, the length of time of our longest loop, plus any overhead.</p>

<p class="docText">The pieces of code that sleep for 4 and 2 seconds now occur concurrently, contributing to the lower overall runtime. You can even see how loop 1 finishes before loop 0.</p>
<p class="docText">The only other major change to our application is the addition of the &quot;<tt>sleep(6)</tt>&quot; call. Why is this necessary? The reason is that if we did not stop the main thread from continuing, it would proceed to the next statement, displaying &quot;all done&quot; and exit, killing both threads running <tt>loop0()</tt> and <tt>loop1()</tt>.</P>
<p class="docText">We did not have any code that told the main thread to wait for the child threads to complete before continuing. This is what we mean by threads requiring some sort of synchronization. In our case, we used another <tt>sleep()</tt> call as our synchronization mechanism. We used a value of 6 seconds because we know that both threads (which take 4 and 2 seconds, as you know) should have completed by the time the main thread has counted to 6.</p>
<p class="docText">You are probably thinking that there should be a better way of managing threads than creating that extra delay of 6 seconds in the main thread. Because of this delay, the overall runtime is no better than in our single-threaded version. Using <tt>sleep()</tt> for thread synchronization as we did is not reliable. What if our loops had independent and varying execution times? We may be exiting the main thread too early or too late. This is where locks come in.</P>
<p class="docText">Making yet another update to our code to include locks as well as getting rid of separate loop functions, we get <tt>mtsleep2.py</tt>, presented in <a class="docLink" href="#ch18list03">Example 18.3</a>. Running it, we see that the output is similar to <tt>mtsleep1.py</tt>. The only difference is that we did not have to wait the extra time for <tt>mtsleep1.py</tt> to conclude. By using locks, we were able to exit as soon as both threads had completed execution.</p>

<p class="docText">So how did we accomplish our task with locks? Let us take a look at the source code.</p>
<a name="ch18lev2sec8"></a>

<H4 id="title-IDAA1FVD" class="docSection2Title">Line-by-Line Explanation</H4>
<a name="ch18lev3sec1"></a>
<h5 id="title-IDAJ1FVD" class="docSection3Title">Lines 16</h5>
<p class="docText">After the Unix startup line, we import the <tt>thread</tt> module and a few familiar attributes of the <tt>time</tt> module. Rather than hardcoding separate functions to count to 4 and 2 seconds, we will use a single <tt>loop()</tt> function and place these constants in a list, <tt>loops</tt>.</p>

<a name="ch18lev3sec2"></a>

<H5 id="title-IDAA2FVD" class="docSection3Title">Lines 812</h5>
<p class="docText">The <tt>loop()</tt> function will proxy for the now-removed <tt>loop*()</tt> functions from our earlier examples. We had to make some cosmetic changes to <tt>loop()</tt> so that it can now perform its duties using locks. The obvious changes are that we need to be told which loop number we are as well as how long to sleep for. The last piece of new information is the lock itself. Each thread will be allocated an acquired lock. When the <tt>sleep()</tt> time has concluded, we will release the corresponding lock, indicating to the main thread that this thread has completed.</p>

<a name="ch18lev3sec3"></a>
<H5 id="title-IDAV2FVD" class="docSection3Title">Lines 1434</h5>
<p class="docText">The bulk of the work is done here in <tt>main()</tt> using three separate <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>for</tt></span> loops. We first create a list of locks, which we obtain using the <tt>thread.allocate_lock()</tt> function and acquire (each lock) with the <tt>acquire()</tt> method. Acquiring a lock has the effect of &quot;locking the lock.&quot; Once it is locked, we add the lock to the lock list, <tt>locks</tt>. The next loop actually spawns the threads, invoking the <tt>loop()</tt> function per thread, and for each thread, provides it with the loop number, the time to sleep for, and the acquired lock for that thread. So why didn't we start the threads in the lock acquisition loop? There are several reasons: (1) we wanted to synchronize the threads, so that &quot;all the horses started out the gate&quot; around the same time, and (2) locks take a little bit of time to be acquired. If your thread executes &quot;too fast,&quot; it is possible that it completes before the lock has a chance to be acquired.</p>
<p class="docText">It is up to each thread to unlock its lock object when it has completed execution. The final loop just sits and spins (pausing the main thread) until both locks have been released before continuing execution. Since we are checking each lock sequentially, we may be at the mercy of all the slower loops if they are more toward the beginning of the set of loops. In such cases, the majority of the wait time may be for the first loop(s). When that lock is released, remaining locks may have already been unlocked (meaning that corresponding threads have completed execution). The result is that the main thread will fly through those lock checks without pause. Finally, you should be well aware that the final pair of lines will execute <tt>main()</tt> only if we are invoking this script directly.</P>
<p class="docText">As hinted in the earlier Core Note, we presented the <tt>tHRead</tt> module only to introduce the reader to threaded programming. Your MT application should use higher-level modules such as the <tt>threading</tt> module, which we will now discuss.</p>
