Programming</span> proves to be well worth the waitits deep and
broad coverage and useful exercises will help readers learn and
practice good Python."</p><p class="docText">Alex Martelli, author of <span class="docEmphasis">Python in a Nutshell</span> and
editor of <span class="docEmphasis">Python Cookbook</span></p><p class="docText">"There has been lot of good buzz around Wesley Chun's <span class="docEmphasis">Core
Python Programming</span>. It turns out that all the buzz is well
earned. I think this is the best book currently available for
learning Python. I would recommend Chun's book over <span class="docEmphasis">Learning
Python</span> (O'Reilly), <span class="docEmphasis">Programming Python</span> (O'Reilly), or
<span class="docEmphasis">The Quick Python Book</span> (Manning)."</p><p class="docText">David Mertz, Ph.D., IBM DeveloperWorks&#174;</p><p class="docText">"I have been doing a lot of research [on] Python for the past
year and have seen a number of positive reviews of your book. The
sentiment expressed confirms the opinion that <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python
Programming</span> is now considered the standard introductory
text."</p><p class="docText">Richard Ozaki, Lockheed Martin</p><p class="docText">"Finally, a book good enough to be both a textbook and a
reference on the Python language now exists."</p><p class="docText">Michael Baxter, <span class="docEmphasis">Linux Journal</span></p><p class="docText">"Very well written. It is the clearest, friendliest book I have
come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider
context. It does not presume a large amount of other experience. It
does go into some important Python topics carefully and in depth.
Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or tortures
the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. [It] sticks to
gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax and structure."</p><p class="docText">http://python.org bookstore Web site</p><p class="docText">"[If ] I could only own one Python book, it would be <span class="docEmphasis">Core
Python Programming</span> by Wesley Chun. This book manages to cover
more topics in more depth than Learning Python but includes it all
in one book that also more than adequately covers the core
language. [If] you are in the market for just one book about
Python, I recommend this book. You will enjoy reading it, including
its wry programmer's wit. More importantly, you will learn Python.
Even more importantly, you will find it invaluable in helping you
in your day-to-day Python programming life. Well done, Mr.
Chun!"</p><p class="docText">Ron Stephens, Python Learning Foundation</p><p class="docText">"I think the best language for beginners is Python, without a
doubt. My favorite book is <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span>."</p><p class="docText">s003apr, MP3Car.com Forums</p><p class="docText">"Personally, I really like Python. It's simple to learn,
completely intuitive, amazingly flexible, and pretty darned fast.
Python has only just started to claim mindshare in the Windows
world, but look for it to start gaining lots of support as people
discover it. To learn Python, I'd start with <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python
Programming</span> by Wesley Chun."</p><p class="docText">Bill Boswell, MCSE, Microsoft Certified Professional
Magazine Online</p><p class="docText">"If you learn well from books, I suggest <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python
Programming</span>. It is by far the best I've found. I'm a Python
newbie as well and in three months time I've been able to implement
Python in projects at work (automating MSOffice, SQL DB stuff,
etc.)."</p><p class="docText">ptonman, Dev Shed Forums</p><p class="docText">"Python is simply a beautiful language. It's easy to learn, it's
cross-platform, and it works. It has achieved many of the technical
goals that Java strives for. A one-sentence description of Python
would be: 'All other languages appear to have evolved over
time--but Python was designed.' And it was designed well.
Unfortunately, there aren't a large number of books for Python. The
best one I've run across so far is <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python
Programming</span>."</p><p class="docText">Chris Timmons, C. R. Timmons Consulting</p><p class="docText">"If you like the Prentice Hall Core series, another good
full-blown treatment to consider would be <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python
Programming</span>. It addresses in elaborate concrete detail many
practical topics that get little, if any, coverage in other
books."</p><p class="docText">Mitchell L Model, MLM Consulting</p><p class="docText">"<span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span> is an amazingly easy read! The
liberal use of examples helps clarify some of the more subtle
points of the language. And the comparisons to languages with which
I'm already familiar (C/C++/Java) get you programming in record
speed."</p><p class="docText">Michael Santos, Ph.D., Green Hills Software</p><p class="docText">The Complete Developer's Guide to PythonFully Updated
