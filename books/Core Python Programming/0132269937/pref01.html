<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;The long-awaited second edition of Wesley Chun's <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span> proves to be well worth the waitits deep and broad coverage and useful exercises will help readers learn and practice good Python.&quot;</p>
<p class="docText">Alex Martelli, author of <span class="docEmphasis">Python in a Nutshell</span> and editor of <span class="docEmphasis">Python Cookbook</span></P></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;There has been lot of good buzz around Wesley Chun's <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span>. It turns out that all the buzz is well earned. I think this is the best book currently available for learning Python. I would recommend Chun's book over <span class="docEmphasis">Learning Python</span> (O'Reilly), <span class="docEmphasis">Programming Python</span> (O'Reilly), or <span class="docEmphasis">The Quick Python Book</span> (Manning).&quot;</P>
<p class="docText">David Mertz, Ph.D., IBM DeveloperWorks<sup>&#174;</sup></P></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;I have been doing a lot of research [on] Python for the past year and have seen a number of positive reviews of your book. The sentiment expressed confirms the opinion that <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span> is now considered the standard introductory text.&quot;</P>
<p class="docText">Richard Ozaki, Lockheed Martin</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;Finally, a book good enough to be both a textbook and a reference on the Python language now exists.&quot;</p>
<p class="docText">Michael Baxter, <span class="docEmphasis">Linux Journal</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;Very well written. It is the clearest, friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of other experience. It does go into some important Python topics carefully and in depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. [It] sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax and structure.&quot;</P>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://python.org">http://python.org</a> bookstore Web site</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;[If] I could only own one Python book, it would be <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span> by Wesley Chun. This book manages to cover more topics in more depth than <span class="docEmphasis">Learning Python</span> but includes it all in one book that also more than adequately covers the core language. [If] you are in the market for just one book about Python, I recommend this book. You will enjoy reading it, including its wry programmer's wit. More importantly, you will learn Python. Even more importantly, you will find it invaluable in helping you in your day-to-day Python programming life. Well done, Mr. Chun!&quot;</P>
<p class="docText">Ron Stephens, Python Learning Foundation</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;I think the best language for beginners is Python, without a doubt. My favorite book is <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span>.&quot;</P>
<p class="docText">s003apr, MP3Car.com Forums</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;Personally, I really like Python. It's simple to learn, completely intuitive, amazingly flexible, and pretty darned fast. Python has only just started to claim mindshare in the Windows world, but look for it to start gaining lots of support as people discover it. To learn Python, I'd start with <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span> by Wesley Chun.&quot;</P>
<p class="docText">Bill Boswell, MCSE, Microsoft Certified Professional Magazine Online</P></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;If you learn well from books, I suggest <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span>. It is by far the best I've found. I'm a Python newbie as well and in three months time I've been able to implement Python in projects at work (automating MSOffice, SQL DB stuff, etc.).&quot;</p>
<p class="docText">ptonman, Dev Shed Forums</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;Python is simply a beautiful language. It's easy to learn, it's cross-platform, and it works. It has achieved many of the technical goals that Java strives for. A one-sentence description of Python would be: 'All other languages appear to have evolved over timebut Python was designed.' And it was designed well. Unfortunately, there aren't a large number of books for Python. The best one I've run across so far is <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span>.&quot;</p>
<p class="docText">Chris Timmons, C. R. Timmons Consulting</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">&quot;If you like the Prentice Hall Core series, another good full-blown treatment to consider would be <span class="docEmphasis">Core Python Programming</span>. It addresses in elaborate concrete detail many practical topics that get little, if any, coverage in other books.&quot;</P>
<p class="docText">Mitchell L Model, MLM Consulting</p></blockquote>
