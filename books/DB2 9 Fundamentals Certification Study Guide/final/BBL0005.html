<p class="first-para">One of the biggest challenges computer professionals face today is keeping their skill sets current with the latest changes in technology. When the computing industry was in its infancy, it was possible to become an expert in several different areas, because the scope of the field was relatively small. Today, our industry is both widespread and fast paced, and the skills needed to master a single software package can be quite complex. Because of this complexity, many application and hardware vendors have initiated certification programs to evaluate and validate an individual's knowledge of their technology. Businesses benefit from these programs, because professional certification gives them confidence that an individual has the expertise needed to perform a specific job. Computer professionals benefit, because professional certification allows them to deliver high levels of service and technical expertise, and, more importantly, because professional certification can lead to advancement or new job opportunities within the computer industry.</p>
<p class="para">If you've bought this book (or if you are thinking about buying this book), chances are you have already decided you want to acquire one or more of the IBM DB2 Professional Certifications available. As an individual who holds ten IBM DB2 professional certifications, let me assure you that the exams you must pass in order to become a certified DB2 professional are not easy. IBM prides itself on designing comprehensive certification exams that are relevant to the work environment an individual holding a particular certification will have had some exposure to. As a result, all of IBM's certification exams are designed with the following questions in mind:</p>
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="first-para">What are the critical tasks that must be performed by an individual who holds a particular professional certification?</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">What skills must an individual possess in order to perform each critical task identified?</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">How frequently will an individual perform each critical task identified?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">You will find that to pass a DB2 certification exam, you must possess a solid understanding of DB2-and for some of the more advanced certifications, you must understand many of its nuances as well.</p>

<p class="last-para">Now for the good news. You are holding in your hands what I consider to be the best tool you can use to prepare for the DB2 9 Fundamentals exam (Exam 730). When IBM began work on the DB2 9 certification exams, I was invited once again to participate in the exam development process. In addition to helping define the exam objectives, I authored several exam questions, and I provided feedback on many more before the final exams went into production. Consequently, I have seen every exam question you are likely to encounter, and I know every concept you will be tested on when you take the DB2 9 Fundamentals exam (Exam 730). Using this knowledge, along with copies of the actual exam questions, I developed this study guide, which not only covers every concept you must know in order to pass the DB2 9 Fundamentals exam (Exam 730) but also covers the exam process itself and the requirements for each DB2 9 certification role available. In addition, you will find, at the end of each chapter, sample questions that are worded just like the actual exam questions. In short, if you see it in this book, count on seeing it on the exam; if you don't see it in this book, it won't be on the exam. If you become familiar with the material presented in this book, you should do well on the exam.</p>
