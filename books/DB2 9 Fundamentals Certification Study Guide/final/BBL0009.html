<p class="PARA">DB2, formally called DATABASE 2, was born on MVS in 1983. In 1987, DB2 arrived on the Personal Computer as the Database Manager in OS/2 1.3 Extended Edition; a year later, it emerged as SQL/400 for IBM's new AS/400 server. By 1992, DB2 had become a stand-alone product on OS/2 (it now had the name DB2/2), and in 1993, DB2 appeared on AIX; this port prompted another name change, and DB2/2 became DB2 for Common Servers. New editions of DB2 were introduced on HP-UX and Solaris in 1994, on Windows in 1995, and on Linux in 1999. Along the way the name changed again, and DB2 for Common Servers became DB2 Universal Database.</p>
<p CLASS="para">DB2 9 is the latest release of IBM's popular data management software for distributed systems, and with this release comes yet another name change. Like previous versions, DB2 runs on a wide variety of platforms (AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, i5/OS, and z/OS), and several editions are available-each of which has been designed to meet a specific business need. These editions, along with an extensive suite of add-on products that provide additional storage capability and advanced connectivity, are collectively known as the <i CLASS="emphasis">DB2 Family</i>. The editions that make up the heart of the DB2 Family are:</p>

<a NAME="103"></a><a name="ch02le"></a>DB2 Express Edition</h3>
<p CLASS="FIRST-PARA">DB2 Express Edition (or DB2 Express) is an entry-level data server that is designed to be used on microcomputers that have up to two CPUs (a dual-core processor is treated as a single CPU), have up to 4 GB of memory, and are running a supported version of Linux, Solaris, or Windows. DB2 Express contains a rich feature set that will meet the needs of most deployments; for workloads or environments that require additional functionality, add-on features are available for an additional licensing fee. Add-on features available for DB2 Express include:</p> 
<ul CLASS="SIMPLE-LIST">
<li CLASS="first-listitem">
<p class="PARA">
<b>pureXML:</b> The DB2 pureXML<span CLASS="UNICODE">&trade;</span> Feature provides simple, efficient access to XML data while providing the same levels of security, integrity, and resiliency that are available for relational data. DB2 9 stores XML data in a hierarchical format that naturally reflects the structure of XML. This storage approach, along with innovative XML indexing techniques, allows DB2 to manage XML data efficiently while eliminating the complex and time-consuming parsing that is typically required to store XML data in a relational database.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="PARA">
<b>High Availability:</b> The DB2 High Availability Feature provides 24 x 7 availability to a DB2 data server. Three packages that constitute this feature are High Availability Disaster Recovery (HADR), Online Reorganization, and IBM Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms (TSA MP). HADR allows failover to a standby system in the event that a software or hardware failure occurs on the primary system. Online Reorganization reconstructs the rows in a table to eliminate fragmentation and compacts information for better performance while permitting uninterrupted access to table data. TSA MP provides high availability by automating the control of IT resources such as processes, file systems, and IP addresses.</p> 
<a name="104"></a><a name=""></a>
</li>
<li CLASS="listitem">
<p class="PARA">
<b>Workload Management:</b> The DB2 Workload Management Feature leverages the Connection Concentrator in conjunction with either Query Patroller (QP) or the DB2 Governor to provide a more proactive, fail-safe workload environment. Connection Concentrator enables fail-safe operation and load balancing of a workload. Query Patroller is a powerful query workload management tool that proactively and dynamically controls submission and execution of queries to manage DB2 data server workloads better. The DB2 Governor monitors and changes the behavior of applications that run against the DB2 data server, depending on rules that you specify in the governor configuration file. For example, if an application is using too much of a particular resource, a rule might specify that the priority of the application is to be changed or that the application is to be forced to disconnect from the database.</p> 
</li>
<li CLASS="LISTITEM">
<p class="para">
<b>Performance Optimization:</b> DB2 Performance Optimization combines the functionality of three modules to provide performance optimizations for complex queries, data clustering for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) applications, and high performance for machines with multiple processors. This feature consists of materialized query tables (MQTs), multidimensional clustering (MDC), and Query Parallelism. MQTs are tables whose definition is based on the result of a query; queries against an MQT can return results faster than would be possible if a normal table were used. MDC provides an elegant method for clustering data in tables along multiple dimensions. Query Parallelism allows for the simultaneous processing of parts of a single query by multiple processors, dramatically improving overall performance on multi-processor machines.</p> 
</li>
<li CLASS="LISTITEM">
<p CLASS="para">
<b>DB2 Homogenous Federation Feature:</b> The DB2 Homogeneous Federation Feature provides the ability to manage and access remote DB2 and Informix data servers as if they were local tables; it also allows applications to access diverse types of data (mainframe and distributed, public and private) as if it were in a base table, regardless of where it physically resides. Homogeneous federation meets the needs of customers who require unified access to data managed by multiple data servers.</p>

<ul CLASS="simple-list">
<li class="FIRST-LISTITEM">
<p CLASS="PARA">
<b>Storage Optimization:</b> The DB2 Storage Optimization Feature gives you the ability to compress data on disk in order to decrease disk space and storage infrastructure requirements. Since disk storage systems can often be the most expensive components of a database solution, even a small reduction in the storage subsystem can result in substantial cost savings for the entire database solution.</p>

<b>Advanced Access Control:</b> The Advanced Access Control Feature lets you decide exactly who has write access and who has read access to individual rows and/or columns in one or more tables. Label-Based Access Control (LBAC), the package that provides this feature, controls access to table objects by attaching security labels to them. Users attempting to access an object must have been granted an appropriate security label. When an object protected by a security policy is accessed, DB2 applies the appropriate access rules to determine whether access should be granted or not. When there's a match, access is permitted; without a match, access is denied.</p>

<li class="LISTITEM">
<p CLASS="para">
<b>Database Partitioning:</b> The DB2 Database Partitioning Feature (DPF) provides the ability to manage very large databases better by dividing them into multiple partitions and storing those partitions across a cluster of multiple inexpensive servers. DPF processes complex queries more efficiently, giving better performance with smaller systems, while providing an option to easily expand to a cluster of servers as the organization's data needs grow. DPF can also improve data availability by reducing the time required for, as well as the impact of, standard maintenance activities.</p>

(Administrators simply drag objects onto predefined layouts to add OLAP functionality; no extensive knowledge of OLAP is needed.) DB2 DWE OLAP Acceleration also accelerates OLAP queries by analyzing dimensional models and recommending aggregates that will improve OLAP performance. Administrators can use the DB2 DWE OLAP Acceleration feature to show summarized, graphical views of business activity.

<b>DB2 DWE Data Mining and Visualization Features:</b> DB2 DWE Data Mining and Visualization Features help you discover hidden relationships in your data, without requiring you to export the data to a special data mining computer or work with small samples of the data. The data mining process starts with historical data being gathered and put through a series of mathematical functions to derive business rules, which are then collected together to form a Model. Next, the Visualization feature provides data mining model analysis via a Java-based results browser. This is done to verify that the business rules derived are accurate. Finally, the verified business rules are applied to new data to determine the appropriate predicted outcome. This process of applying the business rules is called Scoring; Scoring in real time allows businesses to catch fraudulent records and defects faster.</p>

<b>DB2 Query Patroller:</b> DB2 Query Patroller is a powerful query management system that can be used to control the flow of queries against a DB2 database dynamically. With the DB2 Query Patroller, an administrator can define separate query classes for queries of different sizes to share system resources better among queries; give queries submitted by certain users high priority so that they will run sooner, automatically put large queries on hold so that they can be canceled or scheduled to run during off-peak hours; and collect information about completed queries to determine trends and identify frequently used tables and indexes.</p>

<p class="FIRST-PARA">DB2 for i5/OS is an advanced, 64-bit relational database management system that leverages the On-Demand capabilities of System i, such as Dynamic Logical Partitioning to respond quickly to changing workloads in order to ensure business continuity in a dynamic environment. Unlike other DB2 editions, DB2 for i5/OS is built directly into the operating system. As a result, Version/Release naming will differ because DB2 for i5/OS follows the i5/OS version/release numbering scheme, and not the DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows version/release scheme. The current level of DB2 for i5/OS is Version 5 Release 4 (V5R4).</p>

<p class="para">Because of the unique architecture of IBM's System i5 and the way the DB2 database engine has been tightly integrated with the operating system, many of the traditional database-specific administration requirements associated with other database management systems either aren't necessary with DB2 for i5/OS or are provided through various operating system facilities. For example, graphical tools used to administer a DB2 for i5/OS database are provided as part of the iSeries Navigator component of the OS, whereas DB2's Control Center is used to administer DB2 editions that run on Linux, UNIX, and Windows. With iSeries Navigator, you can perform the following tasks:</p>
