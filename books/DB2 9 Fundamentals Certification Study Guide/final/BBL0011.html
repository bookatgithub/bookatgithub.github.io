<p CLASS="FIRST-PARA">With the exception of DB2 Everyplace, DB2 for i5/OS, and DB2 for z/OS, each edition of DB2 and the DB2 Client comes with a comprehensive set of tools designed to assist in administering and managing DB2 instances, databases, and database objects. The majority of these tools have a graphical user interface (GUI); however, most of the tasks that can be performed with the GUI tools provided can also be performed by issuing equivalent DB2 commands from the operating system prompt or the DB2 Command Line Processor (another tool that we'll look at later in this section). The following subsections describe the most commonly used GUI tools available.</p>

<p CLASS="first-para">The Satellite Administration Center is a GUI application that allows users to set up and administer a group of DB2 servers that perform the same business function. These servers, known as <i CLASS="emphasis">satellites</i>, all run the same application and have the same DB2 database definition needed to support a particular application. With the Satellite Administration Center, users create a group and then define satellites as members of this group. This group of satellites can then be administered as a single entity, as opposed to each satellite having to be administered separately. If additional DB2 servers that perform the same business function are acquired later, they are simply added to the group as additional satellites.</p> 
<p CLASS="para">Information about a satellite environment is stored in a central database referred to as the <i CLASS="emphasis">satellite control database</i>. This database records, among other things, which satellites are in the environment, the group each satellite belongs to, and which version of an end-user business application a satellite is currently running. This database resides on a DB2 server known as the <i class="emphasis">DB2 control server</i>, and it must be <a NAME="157"></a><a name=""></a>cataloged and accessible to the Control Center before the Satellite Administration Center can interact with it.</p> 
<p CLASS="last-para">Groups of satellites are administered by creating batch scripts to set up and maintain the database definition that is needed to support the same business application on each satellite in a group. Each satellite then regularly connects to its satellite control server and downloads any scripts that apply to it. The satellite executes these scripts locally and uploads the results back to the satellite control database. This process of downloading batch scripts, executing them, and reporting the results of the batch execution back to the satellite control database is known as <i class="emphasis">synchronization</i>. A satellite synchronizes to maintain its consistency with the other satellites that belong to its group.</p>

<p CLASS="PARA">The output provided by Visual Explain consists of a hierarchical graph that represents the various components that are needed to process the access plan that has been chosen for a particular SQL statement. Each component is represented as a graphical object known as a <i CLASS="emphasis">node</i>, and two types of nodes can exist:</p> 
<ul CLASS="SIMPLE-LIST">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="para">
<b>Operator:</b> An operator node is used to identify either an action that must be performed on data, or output produced from a table or index.</p>
</li>
<li CLASS="listitem">
<p class="PARA">
<b>Operand:</b> An operand node is used to identify an entity on which an operation is performed (for example, a table would be the operand of a table scan operator).</p> 
</li>
</ul>
<p CLASS="para">Typically, operand nodes are used to identify tables (symbolized in the hierarchical graph by rectangles), indexes (symbolized by diamonds), and table queues (symbolized by parallelograms-table queues are used when intrapartition parallelism is used). Operator nodes, on the other hand, are used to identify anything from an insert operation to an index or table scan. Operator nodes, which are symbolized in the hierarchical graph by ovals, indicate how data is accessed, how tables are joined, and other factors such as whether or not a sort operation is to be performed. Arrows that illustrate how data flows from one node to the next connect all nodes shown in the hierarchical graph, and a <span class="FIXED">RETURN</span> operator normally terminates this path.</p>
<p class="PARA">Visual Explain allows users to quickly view the statistics used at the time a particular query was optimized, determine whether or not an index would improve access to a table, obtain information about the cost required to perform a particular operation, and understand how tables have been joined. Armed with this information, administrators can make database design changes, and application developers can fine-tune SQL statements to improve overall performance.</p>
<p class="PARA">Visual Explain can be invoked directly from the Command Editor by selecting the Access Plan page. However, before Explain information can be displayed, an access plan must exist; access plans can be generated for SQL statements entered on the Commands page of the Command Editor by selecting either the Execute and Access plan or the Access Plan icon from the Command Editor toolbar. <a CLASS="internaljump" HREF="#ch02fig11">Figure 2-11</a> identifies the Command Editor toolbar icon that is used to generate an access plan for an SQL statement.

The snapshot monitor allows you to capture a picture of the state of a database (along with all database activity) at a specific point in time, while event monitors capture and log data as specific database events occur. Along with the Database System Monitor, DB2 provides two additional tools that are designed to help database administrators monitor DB2 systems under their control. These tools are known as the <i class="emphasis">Health Monitor</i> and the <i CLASS="emphasis">Health Center</i>. Together, these tools provide a <i CLASS="EMPHASIS">management by exception</i> capability that enables administrators to address system health issues before they become real problems.</p>
<p CLASS="PARA">The Health Monitor is a server-side tool that constantly monitors the health of a DB2 Database Manager instance without a need for user interaction; the Health Monitor uses several <i CLASS="EMPHASIS">health indicators</i> to evaluate specific aspects of instance and database performance. A health indicator is a system characteristic that the Health Monitor monitors continuously to determine whether or not an object is operating normally; each health indicator has a corresponding set of predefined threshold values, and the Health Monitor compares the state of the system against these health-indicator thresholds to see whether they have been exceeded. If the Health Monitor finds that a predefined threshold has been surpassed (for example, if the amount of log space available is insufficient), or if it detects an abnormal state for an object (for example, if the instance is down), it will automatically raise an alert.</p> 
<p CLASS="PARA">The Health Center is a GUI tool that is designed to interact with the Health Monitor. Using the Health Center, you can select the instance and database objects that you want to monitor, customize the threshold settings of any health indicator, and specify where notifications are to be sent and what actions are to be taken if an alert is issued. The Health Center also allows you to start and stop the Health Monitor as well as access details about current alerts and obtain a list of recommended actions that describe how to resolve the situation that caused an alert to be generated. <a HREF="#ch02fig13" CLASS="INTERNALJUMP">Figure 2-13</a> shows how the Health Center looks on a Windows XP server (in this case, after two warning-type alerts have been generated).</p>

<p class="first-para">If you are running DB2 for i5/OS, the SQL Performance Monitor is a valuable tool that can be used to keep track of the resources SQL statements use. Information on resource usage can help you determine whether your system and/or your SQL statements are performing at optimum level or whether they need to be tuned. There are two types of monitors you can elect to use:</p> 
<ul class="simple-list">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="para">
<b>Summary SQL Performance Monitor:</b> The Summary SQL Performance Monitor is the iSeries Navigator version of the Memory Resident Database Monitor, found on the system interface. As the name implies, this monitor resides in memory and only retains a summary of the data collected. When the monitor is paused or ended, this data is written to disk; once written to disk, the data collected can be analyzed. Because the Summary SQL Performance Monitor stores its information in memory, the performance impact to the system is minimized. However, some of the details are lost.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="para">
<b>Detailed SQL Performance Monitor:</b> The detailed SQL performance monitor is the iSeries Navigator version of the Database Monitor, found on the system interface. This monitor saves detailed data to disk, as it is collected, and does not need to be paused or ended in order to analyze the results. Data collected by this monitor can also be used as input to Visual Explain, whereas data collected by the Summary SQL Performance Monitor cannot. However, since this monitor does save data in real time, it may have a negative impact on system performance.</p>

<a name="189"></a><a name="CH02LEV"></a>The Design Advisor</h3>
<p class="first-para">As with other relational database systems, the primary purpose of an index in a DB2 database is to help the database engine quickly locate records stored in a table; if a table is referenced in a query and no corresponding index exists, the entire table must be scanned sequentially to locate the desired data. And if the table contains a large amount of data, such a scan can take a significant amount of time. In most cases, if an index is created for frequently used columns in a table, performance can often be greatly improved for data access operations. That's because index files are generally smaller and require less time to read than their <a name="190"></a><a name=""></a>corresponding table files, particularly as tables grow in size. Furthermore, the entire index may not need to be scanned; predicates can be applied to an index to reduce the number of rows that must actually be read.</p>
<p class="PARA">Therefore, indexes are important because they:</p>
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="FIRST-PARA">Provide a fast, efficient method for locating specific rows of data in very large tables.</p>
</li>
<li class="LISTITEM">
<p CLASS="first-para">Provide a logical ordering of the rows of a table. Data is stored in a table in no particular order; when indexes are used, the values of one or more columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order. This is very beneficial when processing queries that contain <span CLASS="FIXED">ORDER BY</span> and <span class="FIXED">GROUP BY</span> clauses.</p>
</li>
<li CLASS="listitem">
<p CLASS="first-para">Improve overall query performance. If no index exists on a table, a table scan must be performed for each table referenced in a query. The larger the table, the longer a table scan takes because a table scan requires each table row to be accessed sequentially.</p>
</li>
<li CLASS="listitem">
<p class="FIRST-PARA">Can be used to enforce the uniqueness of records stored in a table.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p CLASS="first-para">Can require a table to use <i CLASS="EMPHASIS">clustering</i> storage, which causes the rows of a table to be physically arranged according to the ordering of their index column values. Although all indexes provide a logical ordering of data, only a clustering index provides a physical ordering of data.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">Can provide greater concurrency in multi-user environments. Because records can be located faster, acquired locks do not have to be held as long.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p CLASS="PARA">However, there is a price to pay for these benefits:</p> 
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li CLASS="FIRST-LISTITEM">
<p class="first-para">Each index created requires additional storage or disk space. The exact amount of space needed is dependent upon the size of the associated table, along with the size and number of columns contained in the index.</p> 
</li>
<li CLASS="listitem">
<p class="FIRST-PARA">Every insert and update operation performed on a table requires additional updating of the indexes associated with that table. This is also true when data is bulk-loaded into a table using DB2's <span CLASS="FIXED">LOAD</span> utility.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p CLASS="FIRST-PARA">Each index potentially adds an alternative access path that the DB2 optimizer must consider when generating the optimum access plan to use to resolve a query. This in turn increases compilation time when static queries are embedded in an application program.</p> 
</li>
</ul>
<a NAME="191"></a><a NAME="N8434"></a>
<p CLASS="para">So how do you decide when having an index would be beneficial and how do you determine what indexes should exist? And how do you decide whether to use materialized query tables (MQTs), partitioning, or both to help improve index performance? Even if you have a lot of experience with database and database application design, the task of selecting which indexes, MQTs, clustering dimensions, or database partitions to create for a complex workload can be quite daunting. That's where the Design Advisor comes in.</p> 
<p CLASS="para">The Design Advisor is a special tool that is designed to capture specific information about typical workloads (queries or sets of SQL operations) performed against your database and recommend changes based upon the information provided. When given a set of SQL statements in a workload, the Design Advisor will make recommendations for:</p> 
<ul CLASS="ITEMIZEDLIST">
<li class="FIRST-LISTITEM">
<p class="FIRST-PARA">New indexes</p>
</li>
<li CLASS="LISTITEM">
<p class="FIRST-PARA">New materialized query tables (MQTs).</p>

</li>
<li CLASS="listitem">
<p CLASS="first-para">Deletion of indexes and MQTs that are not being used by the specified workload</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p CLASS="para">You can have the Design Advisor implement some or all of these recommendations immediately or arrange for them to be applied at a later time. Furthermore, the Design Advisor can be used to aid in the design of a new database or to improve performance of a database that is already in operation. For example, in designing a database, the Design Advisor can be used to:</p>
<ul CLASS="itemizedlist">
<li CLASS="first-listitem">

<a name="198"></a><a name="ch02lev"></a>The Developer Workbench</h3>
<p class="first-para">When you set up a remote DB2 database server and access it from one or more DB2 client workstations, you have, in essence, established a basic DB2 client/server environment. In such an environment, each time an SQL statement is executed against the database on the remote server, the statement itself is sent through a network from the client workstation to the database server. The database server then processes the statement, and the results are sent back, again through the network, to the client workstation. (This means that two messages must go through the network for every SQL statement executed.)</p> 
<p class="PARA">To take advantage of this architecture, client/server application development focuses on breaking an application into two parts, storing those parts on two platforms (the client and the server), and having them communicate with each <a name="199"></a><a name=""></a>other as the application executes. This allows the code that interacts directly with a database to reside on a database server or midrange computer, where computing power and centralized control can be used to provide quick, coordinated data access. At the same time, the application logic can reside on one or more smaller (client) workstations so that it can make effective use of all the resources the client workstation has to offer without causing a bottleneck at the server.</p> 
<p class="para">If you have an application that contains one or more transactions that perform a relatively large amount of database activity with little or no user interaction, each transaction can be stored on the database server as a <i class="EMPHASIS">stored procedure</i>. With a stored procedure, all database processing done by the transaction can be performed directly at the database server. Because a stored procedure is invoked by a single SQL statement, fewer messages have to be transmitted across the network-only the data that is actually needed at the client workstation has to be sent across.</p> 
<p class="PARA">As you might imagine, the complexity of developing, debugging, and deploying stored procedures increases as the amount of work a stored procedure is expected to do increases. However, this complexity can be greatly reduced when stored procedures are developed using a special tool known as the Developer Workbench.</p> 
<p class="para">The Developer Workbench is an Eclipse-based, comprehensive development environment that can be used to create, edit, debug, deploy, and test DB2 stored procedures and user-defined functions. The Developer Workbench can also be used to develop SQLJ applications and to create, edit, and run SQL statements and XQuery expressions. <a href="#ch0" class="INTERNALJUMP">Figure 2-19</a> shows how the Developer Workbench looks when it is first activated on a Windows XP server.</p>
