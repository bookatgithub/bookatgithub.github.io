<p class="first-para">So far, we have looked at a variety of ways in which a query can be constructed using the <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> SQL statement. We have also seen how the results of a query can be returned to the user when an SQL statement is executed from the Command Editor or the Command Line Processor. However, we have not seen how the results of a query can be obtained when a <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> statement is executed from an application program.</p>
<p class="para">When a query is executed from within an application, DB2 uses a mechanism known as a <i class="emphasis">cursor</i> to retrieve data values from the result data set produced. The name "cursor" probably originated from the blinking cursor found on early computer screens, and just as that cursor indicated the current position on the screen and identified where typed words would appear next, a DB2 cursor indicates the current position in the result data set (i.e., the current row) and identifies which row of data will be returned to the application next. Depending upon how it has been defined, a cursor can be categorized as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple-list">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="para">
<b>Read-only:</b> Read-only cursors are cursors that have been constructed in such a way that rows in their corresponding result data set can be read but not modified or deleted. A cursor is considered read-only if it is based on a read-only <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> statement. (For example, the statement "<span class="fixed">SELECT deptname FROM department"</span> is a read-only <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> statement.)</p>
<a name="605"></a><a name=""></a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="para">
<b>Updatable:</b> Updatable cursors are cursors that have been constructed in such a way that rows in their corresponding result data set can be modified or deleted. A cursor is considered updatable if the <span class="fixed">FOR UPDATE</span> clause was specified when the cursor was created. (Only one table can be referenced in the <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> statement that is used to create an updatable cursor.)</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="para">
<b>Ambiguous:</b> Ambiguous cursors are cursors that have been constructed in such a way that it is impossible to tell if they are meant to be read-only or updatable. (Ambiguous cursors are treated as read-only cursors if the <span class="fixed">BLOCKING ALL</span> option was specified during precompiling or binding. Otherwise, they are considered updatable.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">Regardless of which type of cursor used, the following steps must be performed in order for a cursor is to be incorporated into an application program:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="first-para">Declare (define) the cursor along with its type and associate it with the desired query (<span class="fixed">SELECT</span> or <span class="fixed">VALUES</span> SQL statement).</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">Open the cursor. This action will cause the corresponding query to be executed and a result data set to be produced.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">Retrieve (fetch) each row in the result data set, one by one, until an "End of data" condition occurs-each time a row is retrieved from the result data set, the cursor is automatically moved to the next row.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">If appropriate, alter or delete the current row by executing an <span class="fixed">UPDATE ... WHERE CURRENT OF</span> or a <span class="fixed">DELETE ... WHERE CURRENT OF</span> SQL statement (only if the cursor is updatable).</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">Close the cursor. This action will cause the result data set that was produced when the corresponding query was executed to be deleted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">With DB2 (as with most other relational database management systems), the following SQL statements are used to carry out the preceding steps:</p>
<div class="informalexample">

<p class="first-para">Before a cursor can be used in an application program, it must be created and associated with the <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> statement that will be used to generate its corresponding result data set.

<div class="informalexample">

<p class="para">If the <span class="fixed">WITH HOLD</span> option is specified when the <span class="fixed">DECLARE CURSOR</span> statement is executed, the cursor created will remain open (once it has been opened) across transaction boundaries and must be explicitly closed. (If this option is not used, the scope of the cursor is limited to the transaction in which it is defined, and the <a name="608"></a><a name=""></a>cursor will be closed automatically when the transaction that declares and opens it is terminated.) If the <span class="fixed">WITH RETURN</span> option is specified when the <span class="fixed">DECLARE CURSOR </span>statement is executed, it is assumed that the cursor has been created from within a stored procedure and that once opened, the cursor is to remain open when control is passed back to either the calling application or the client application, depending on how the <span class="fixed">WITH RETURN</span> option was specified.</p>

<p class="para">Thus, if you wanted to define a read-only cursor named <span class="fixed">MY_CURSOR</span> that is associated with a result data set that contains values obtained from the <span class="fixed">WORKDEPT</span> and <span class="fixed">JOB</span> columns found in a table named <span class="fixed">EMPLOYEE</span>, you could do so by executing a <span class="fixed">DECLARE CURSOR</span> statement that looks something like this:</p>

<p class="first-para">Although a cursor is defined when the <span class="fixed">DECLARE CURSOR</span> SQL statement is executed, the result data set associated with the cursor is not actually produced until the cursor is opened; when a cursor is opened, all rows that satisfy the query associated with the cursor's definition are retrieved and copied to a result data set. Cursors are opened by executing the <span class="fixed">OPEN</span> SQL statement. The basic syntax for this statement is:</p>

<p class="para">On the other hand, if you wanted to open a cursor named <span class="fixed">MY_CURSOR</span> and associate two host variables (named <span class="fixed">LASTNAME</span> and <span class="fixed">FIRSTNAME)</span> with parameter markers that were coded in the <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> statement that was used to create the cursor to be opened, you could do so by executing an <span class="fixed">OPEN</span> statement that looks like this:</p>

<p class="para">It is important to note that the rows of the result data set associated with a query may be derived during the execution of the <span class="fixed">OPEN</span> statement (in which case a temporary table may be created to hold them); or they may be derived during the execution of each subsequent <span class="fixed">FETCH</span> statement. In either case, when a cursor is opened, it is placed in the "Open" state, and the cursor pointer is positioned before the first row of data in the result data set produced; if the result data set is empty, <a name="611"></a><a name=""></a>the position of the cursor is effectively "after the last row," and any subsequent <span class="fixed">FETCH</span> operations performed will generate a <span class="fixed">NOT FOUND (+100)</span> condition.</p>

If a cursor is positioned "On a Row of Data" when the FETCH statement is executed, it will be moved to the next row in the result data set (if one exists), and the data values stored in that row will be assigned to the appropriate host variables. If a cursor is positioned on the last row of the result data set when the FETCH statement is executed, it will be moved to the "After the Last Row of Data" position, the value +100 will be assigned to the sqlcode field of the current SQLCA data structure variable, and the value "02000" will be assigned to the sqlstate field of the current SQLCA data structure variable.
