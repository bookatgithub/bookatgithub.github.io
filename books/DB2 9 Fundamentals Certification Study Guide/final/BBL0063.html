<p class="first-para">The correct answer is <b class="bold">A</b>. When a deadlock cycle occurs, all transactions involved will wait indefinitely for a lock to be released unless some outside agent steps in and breaks the cycle. With DB2, this agent is a background process, known as the deadlock detector, and its sole responsibility is to locate and resolve any deadlocks found in the locking subsystem. Each database has its own deadlock detector, which is activated as part of the database initialization process. Once activated, the deadlock detector stays "asleep" most of the time but "wakes up" at preset intervals and examines the locking subsystem to determine whether a deadlock situation exists. If the deadlock detector discovers a deadlock cycle, it randomly selects one of the transactions involved to roll back and terminate; the transaction chosen (referred to as the victim process) is then sent an SQL error code, and every lock it had acquired is released. The remaining transaction(s) can then proceed, because the deadlock cycle has been broken.</p>

Any time one transaction holds a lock on a data resource and another transaction attempts to acquire a lock on the same resource, the DB2 Database Manager will examine each lock's state and determine whether they are compatible. If the state of a lock placed on a data resource by one transaction is such that another lock can be placed on the same resource by another transaction before the first lock acquired is released, the locks are said to be compatible and the second lock will be acquired. However, if the locks are not compatible, the transaction requesting the incompatible lock must wait until the transaction holding the first lock is terminated before it can acquire the lock it needs. If the requested lock is not acquired before the time interval specified in the locktimeout configuration parameter has elapsed, the waiting transaction receives an error message and is rolled back.<a name="1002"></a><a name=""></a>

<p class="first-para">The correct answer is <b class="bold">C</b>. The <span class="fixed">LOCK TABLE</span> statement allows a transaction to explicitly acquire a table-level lock on a particular table in one of two modes: SHARE and <span class="fixed">EXCLUSIVE.</span> If a table is locked using the <span class="fixed">SHARE</span> mode, a table-level Share (S) lock is acquired on behalf of the transaction, and other concurrent transactions are allowed to read, but not change, the data stored in the locked table. If a table is locked using the <span class="fixed">EXCLUSIVE</span> mode, a table-level Exclusive (X) lock is acquired, and other concurrent transactions can neither access nor modify data stored in the locked table.</p>

<p class="first-para">The correct answer is <b class="bold">C</b>. If a transaction holding a lock on a resource needs to acquire a more restrictive lock on the same resource, the DB2 Database Manager will attempt to change the state of the existing lock to the more restrictive state. The action of changing the state of an existing lock to a more restrictive state is known as <i class="emphasis">lock conversion</i>. Lock conversion occurs because a transaction can hold only one lock on a specific data resource at any given time. In most cases, lock conversion is performed on row-level locks, and the conversion process is fairly straightforward. For example, if an Update (U) lock is held and an Exclusive (X) lock is needed, the Update (U) lock will be converted to an Exclusive (X) lock.<a name="1004"></a><a name=""></a>

When the Repeatable Read isolation level is used, the effects of one transaction are completely isolated from the effects of other concurrent transactions; when this isolation level is used, every row that's referenced in any manner by the owning transaction is locked for the duration of that transaction. As a result, if the same <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> SQL statement is issued multiple times within the same transaction, the result data sets produced are guaranteed to be the identical. Other transaction are prohibited from performing insert, update, or delete operations that would affect any row that has been accessed by the owning transaction as long as that transaction remains active.</p>

<p class="first-para">The correct answer is <b class="bold">D</b>. When the Uncommitted Read isolation level is used, rows retrieved by a transaction are only locked if the transaction modifies data associated with one or more rows retrieved or if another transaction attempts to drop or alter the table the rows were retrieved from.) As the name implies, transactions running under the uncommitted read isolation level can see changes made to rows by other transactions before those changes have been committed. On the other hand, transactions running under the Repeatable Read, Read Stability, or Cursor Stability isolation level are prohibited from seeing uncommitted data. Therefore, applications running under the Uncommitted Read isolation level can read the row Application A updated while applications running under a different isolation level cannot. Because no locks are needed in order for Application A to read data stored in other tables, it can do so - even if a restrictive lock is held on that table. However, there is nothing that prohibits Application A from performing an insert operation from within the open transaction.</p>

<p class="first-para">The correct answer is <b class="bold">C</b>. If the Repeatable Read isolation level is used, other agents will be unable to assign seats as long as the transaction that generated the list remains active; therefore, the list will not change when it is refreshed. If the Read Stability isolation level is used, other agents will be able to unassign currently assigned seats (and these unassigned seats will show up when the list is refreshed), but they will not be able to assign any seat that appears in the list as long as the transaction that generated the list remains active. If the Uncommitted Read isolation level is used, other agents will be able to unassign currently assigned seats, as well as assign unassigned seats; however, uncommitted seat unassignments/assignments will show up when the list is refreshed, and the agent may make an inappropriate change based on this data. Therefore, the best isolation level to use for this particular application is the Cursor Stability isolation level.</p>
