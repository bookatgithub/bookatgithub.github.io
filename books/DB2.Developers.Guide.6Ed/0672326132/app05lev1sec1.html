<P class="docText">The PDA version of DB2 is referred to as <span class="docEmphasis">DB2 Everyplace</span>. In addition to Palm and Windows PocketPC, DB2 Everyplace can run in the following environments: Symbian, embedded Linux, QNX Neutrino, Microsoft Win32 and Linux.</P></div><br>
<A NAME="app05lev2sec1"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Different Code Bases</H4>
<P class="docText">There are four distinct code bases for the products under the DB2 brand. The mainframe has its own code base, as does the iSeries, and VSE/VM. The fourth code base is for Linux, Unix, and Windows (LUW) platforms—and all of the other DB2 offerings originate from this code base.<A NAME="app05index05"></A><A NAME="app05index06"></A><A NAME="app05index07"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Having a separate code base means that each of these DB2 "products" was developed independently—at least in the beginning. So, for example, the process used by DB2 for z/OS to optimize SQL differs from the process used by DB2 for Linux. Hopefully, though, the result is similar—an efficient SQL statement.</P>
<P class="docText">So, there will be some major differences between the DB2s.</P>
<A NAME="app05lev2sec2"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Some Major Differences</H4>
<P class="docText">It is obvious that the different DB2 products are not "plug and play" commodities simply because they all share the name <span class="docEmphasis">DB2</span>. There are some big differences among these products in their current releases. The biggest differences are relatively easy to detect and include the following:<A NAME="app05index08"></A><A NAME="app05index09"></A></P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">Differences imposed due to operating system constraints (OS/400 versus OS/390 versus AIX)</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Back-level compatibility issues</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Workstation orientation differences such as GUI interfaces and drag-and-drop menus</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Subsystem-centric implementation (z/OS and OS/390) versus database-centric implementation (workstation)</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Most of these differences are minor and easy to handle. Indeed, IBM has slowly but surely been making these disparate implementations of DB2 more and more alike with each new release and version. However, there are some "gotchas" lurking under the covers that might be more difficult to find.</P>
<P class="docText">Of the basic differences mentioned earlier, the only one that might not be obvious is the focus of the DBMS implementation. DB2 for LUW is database-centric. This implies that each new database carries its own system catalog with it. Additionally, it is not possible to simply access tables across different databases; distributed access is required.</P>
<P class="docText">On z/OS, DB2 is subsystem-centric. A single system catalog spans databases. Each subsystem has a unique identification, and you can create multiple databases within it. Distributed requests are not required to access databases within the same subsystem (or, indeed, across multiple subsystems in a data-sharing environment).<A NAME="app05index10"></A><A NAME="app05index11"></A></P>
<A NAME="app05lev3sec1"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Directories</H5>
<P class="docText">Another concept that is different at the workstation level is that of a directory. The DB2 for OS/390 Directory houses DBMS system-related information regarding DBD structure, skeleton plan and skeleton package tables, RBA log ranges, and utility control data. The information cannot be updated by the user but is managed and controlled by DB2.<A NAME="app05index12"></A><A NAME="app05index13"></A><A NAME="app05index14"></A></P>
<P class="docText">At the workstation level, a directory is another matter altogether. For example, the directory structure used by DB2 for LUW controls the overall environment. The directories used by DB2 for LUW are as follows:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">System Database Directory</span> identifies the databases that can be accessed from the workstation and contains an entry for each local and remote one. Each database entry contains the database name, alias, entry type, and location.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">One <span class="docEmphasis">Volume Database Directory</span> is allocated per disk drive that contains a workstation database. Each entry identifies the location of a specific database on the drive.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">Workstation Directory</span> is used to make a connection to a remote database server. It is used in conjunction with the Database Connection Services Directory to make a connection to a remote host server.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">Database Connection Services Directory</span> is used by DB2 Connect to make a connection to a remote host server.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Not only is it possible for the user to update these directories, it is required. The workstation directories define the environment of DB2 for LUW. Without the proper information recorded in these directories, DB2 might not function in the desired manner. The information in these directories is somewhat analogous to DB2 for OS/390 DSNZPARMs and <TT>SYSDDF</TT>.</P>
<A NAME="app05lev3sec2"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Database Structures</H5>
<P class="docText">Not all the objects available to DB2 for OS/390 users are supported at the workstation level. For example, hardware-specific DB2 objects such as tablespaces and storage groups are not available for DB2 on other platforms, at least as we are used to dealing with them. Partitioning and segmenting as it is done on the OS/390 flavor of DB2 is not possible. However, DB2 for common servers does provide a feature known as a segmented table. But this is not the same concept as a DB2 for OS/390 segmented tablespace. Common server segmented tables are used to span volumes, enabling DB2 to get around the 2 gigabyte file size limitations under AIX.<A NAME="app05index15"></A><A NAME="app05index16"></A><A NAME="app05index17"></A><A NAME="app05index18"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The file structure used for databases differs from platform to platform. For example, DB2 for OS/390 uses VSAM Linear Data Sets (LDS) or Entry Sequenced Data Sets (ESDS). A database deployed on DB2 for common servers uses two files for table data: one for normal data and a second to store long fields. These workstation files are flat files, not VSAM files.</P>
<P class="docText">Although tables are basically the same for all of the DB2 environments, not all of the DDL options are provided in all of the environments. For example, DB2 for OS/390 does not support triggers, and DB2 for common servers does not allow <TT>VALIDPROC</TT>s, <TT>FIELDPROC</TT>s, and <TT>EDITPROC</TT>s.</P>
<A NAME="app05lev3sec3"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Optimizer Differences</H5>
<P class="docText">One of the most significant benefits of relational databases is that they provide built-in optimization. The DB2 for OS/390 optimizer is well-known to mainframe DB2 users, but how similar are the other DB2 optimizers?<A NAME="app05index19"></A><A NAME="app05index20"></A><A NAME="app05index21"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The DB2 for common servers product uses the latest and greatest optimization technology from IBM's Almaden labs: the Starburst optimizer. Starburst is a database optimization research project that has been covered quite extensively in the academic press. Although some Starburst technology will find its way to DB2 for OS/390, the DB2 for OS/390 optimizer will never be completely replaced by Starburst technology. The DB2 for OS/390 optimizer has been finely tuned for its environment over the course of more than a decade.</P>
<P class="docText">Another interesting tidbit is that DB2 for iSeries provides an access method for programmers in which they can bypass the relational engine. This is not encouraged, but it is available.</P>
<A NAME="app05lev3sec4"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Other Differences</H5>
<P class="docText">Other differences exist between the different implementations of DB2. Some of these are caused by the different release cycles IBM has created for the differing platforms. For example, DB2 for Linux, Unix, and Windows has supported recursive SQL for several releases, but DB2 for z/OS just recently added recursive SQL support in Version 8.<A NAME="app05index22"></A><A NAME="app05index23"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The bottom line is that you need to be aware that there are differences between the DB2s on different platforms. Whenever you use a specific implementation of DB2, you need to be aware of the features it supports that other DB2 platforms do not, as well as the features it does not support that other DB2 platforms do support.</P>
