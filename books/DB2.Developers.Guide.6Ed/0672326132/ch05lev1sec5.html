<P class="docText">The table is the basic unit of data that is accessible when using SQL. Data is inserted to, deleted from, and updated within DB2 tables. Once populated, data can be selected from a DB2 table. Basically, the table is the means by which end users gain access to DB2 data.</P>
<P class="docText">In general, you will define one table for each entity for which you will be storing data. A table can be thought of as a grouping of attributes that identify a physical entity. The table name should conform to the entity name. For example, consider the sample table for employees, <TT>DSN8810.EMP</TT>. <TT>EMP</TT> is the name of the table that represents an entity known as "employee." An employee has many attributes, some of which are <TT>EMPNO</TT>, <TT>FIRSTNME</TT>, and <TT>LASTNME</TT>. These attributes are columns of the table.</P>
<P class="docText">When you create one table for each entity, the tables are easy to identify and use because they represent real-world "things."</P>
<P class="docText">Of course, at times, the simple rule of one "physical" table per "logical" entity will need to be broken. This usually occurs when you need to denormalize for performance reasons.

<P class="docText">DB2 table auditing is done on a unit-of-work basis only. DB2 audits only the first table access of any particular type for each unit of work, not every table access. <TT>AUDIT CHANGES</TT> writes an audit trace record for the first insert, update, and delete made by each unit of work. <TT>AUDIT ALL</TT> writes an audit trace record for the first select, insert, update, and delete made by each unit of work. By specifying <TT>AUDIT NONE</TT> or by failing to code an audit parameter, table auditing is inactivated.<A NAME="ch05index644"></A><A NAME="ch05index645"></A><A NAME="ch05index646"></A><A NAME="ch05index647"></A><A NAME="ch05index648"></A><A NAME="ch05index649"></A><A NAME="ch05index650"></A><A NAME="ch05index651"></A><A NAME="ch05index652"></A><A NAME="ch05index653"></A><A NAME="ch05index654"></A><A NAME="ch05index655"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Before deciding to audit DB2 table access, consider that table auditing incurs overhead든ach time a table is accessed in a new unit of work, an audit trace record is written. Additionally, even if auditing has been specified for a given table, no audit trace records are written unless the appropriate DB2 audit trace classes are activated. For <TT>AUDIT CHANGES</TT>, activate audit trace classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. For <TT>AUDIT ALL</TT>, activate audit trace classes 1 through 8.</P>

<P class="docText">Most DB2 tables are permanent, meaning that once created, they exist until an authorized user drops them. At times, though, you may need to create DB2 tables that exist only for the duration of a program run. Such a table is known as a temporary table.<A NAME="ch05index669"></A><A NAME="ch05index670"></A></P>
<P class="docText">DB2 has provided the capability to create temporary tables since Version 5. But the initial functionality was practical only in certain circumstances due to some inherent limitations. This first type of temporary table is known as a created (or global) temporary table.</P>
<table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td width="60" valign="top"><IMG BORDER="0" width="30" height="18" SRC="images/0672326132/graphics/V7_icon.gif" ALT="graphics/V7_icon.gif"></td><td valign="top"><P class="docText"> IBM's support of temporary tables was expanded as of Version 7. Now DB2 offers two different types of temporary tables: created and declared.</P></td></tr></table><br>
<A NAME="ch05lev3sec31"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Why Use Temporary Tables?</H5>
<P class="docText">Before we investigate these two types of temporary tables, let's first address why anyone would want or need to use a temporary table in the first place.</P>
<P class="docText">One potential use of temporary tables is to store intermediate SQL results during a program run. Consider, for example, if the results of a first query need to be used in a subsequent query. Instead of rerunning the first query (or combining it with the subsequent query), the results of the first query can be stored in a temporary table. Then the temporary table can be joined into the second query without incurring the overhead of rerunning the first query. This is particularly useful if the first query is particularly complex or inefficient.<A NAME="ch05index671"></A><A NAME="ch05index672"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Or what about result sets that need to be returned more than once by the same program? Consider this scenario: A complex multi-table join is coded that consumes a lot of resources to run. Furthermore, that join statement needs to be run three times during the course of the program. Instead of running the join three times you can run it once and populate a temporary table with the results. The next two times you can simply read the temporary table which might be more efficient than re-executing the complex, resource-consuming multi-table join.</P>
<P class="docText">Temporary tables also are useful for enabling non-relational data to be processed using SQL. For example, you can create a global temporary table that is populated with IMS data (or any other non-relational data source) by a program. Then during the course of that program, the temporary table containing the IMS data can be accessed by SQL statements and even joined to other DB2 tables. The same could be done for data from a flat file, VSAM, IDMS, or any other non-relational data.</P>
<P class="docText">Another reason for IBM's inclusion of temporary table support in DB2 is to make conversion from other relational products easier. Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle both have supported temporary tables for quite some time now. Without such support in DB2 it was very difficult for developers to convert or port their Oracle or SQL Server applications to DB2. IBM alleviated this problem by enabling temporary table support in DB2.</P>
<P class="docText">Now let's examine the two types of temporary tables supported by DB2.<A NAME="ch05index673"></A><A NAME="ch05index674"></A></P>
<A NAME="ch05lev3sec32"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Created Temporary Tables</H5>
<P class="docText">A created temporary table exists only as long as the process that uses it. Temporary tables are created using the <TT>CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE</TT> statement. When created, the schema for the table is stored in the DB2 system catalog (<TT>SYSIBM.SYSTABLES</TT>) just like any other table, but the <TT>TYPE</TT> column is set to <TT>'G'</TT> to indicate a global temporary table. Created temporary tables are sometimes referred to as global temporary tables, but this is confusing since declared temporary tables are also referred to as global when they are created.<A NAME="ch05index675"></A><A NAME="ch05index676"></A><A NAME="ch05index677"></A><A NAME="ch05index678"></A><A NAME="ch05index679"></A></P>
<P class="docText">It is important to remember that a created global temporary table must be created using a DDL <TT>CREATE</TT> statement before it can be used in any program.</P>
<P class="docText">A created temporary table is instantiated when it is referenced in an <TT>OPEN</TT>, <TT>SELECT INTO</TT>, <TT>INSERT</TT>, or <TT>DELETE</TT> statement, not when it is created. Each application process that uses the temporary table creates a new instance of the table for its use. When using a temporary table, keep the following in mind:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">Because they are not persistent, locking, logging, and recovery do not apply to temporary tables.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Indexes cannot be created on temporary tables, so all access is by a complete table scan.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Constraints cannot be created on temporary tables.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A null is the only default value permitted for columns of a temporary table.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Temporary tables cannot be referenced by DB2 utilities.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Temporary tables cannot be specified as the object of an <TT>UPDATE</TT> statement.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">When deleting from a temporary table, all rows must be deleted.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Although views can be created on temporary tables, the <TT>WITH CHECK OPTION</TT> cannot be specified.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Work file data sets are used to manage the data of created temporary tables. The work database (<TT>DSNDB07</TT>) is used as storage for processing SQL statements that require working storage듩ot just for created temporary tables. If you are using created temporary tables, be sure to examine the DB2 Installation Guide for tactics to estimate the disk storage required for temporary work files.</P>
<P class="docText">When a temporary work file result table is populated using an <TT>INSERT</TT> statement, it uses work file space. No other process can use the same work file space as that temporary work file table until the table goes away. The space is reclaimed when the application process commits or rolls back, or when it is deallocated, depending on which <TT>RELEASE</TT> option was used when the plan or package was bound. It is a good idea to keep the work files in a separate buffer pool to make it easier to monitor. <TT>IFCID 0311</TT> in performance trace class 8 can be used to distinguish these tables from other uses of the work file.<A NAME="ch05index680"></A><A NAME="ch05index681"></A><A NAME="ch05index682"></A></P>

<P class="docText">This new type of temporary table is different from a created temporary table and overcomes many of their limitations. The first significant difference between declared and created temporary tables is that declared temporary tables are specified using a <TT>DECLARE</TT> statement in an application program드nd not using a DDL <TT>CREATE</TT> statement. Because they are not persistent they do not have descriptions in the DB2 Catalog.</P>
<P class="docText">Additionally, declared temporary tables offer significant features and functionality not provided by created temporary tables. Consider<A NAME="ch05index686"></A><A NAME="ch05index687"></A></P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">Declared temporary tables can have indexes and <TT>CHECK</TT> constraints defined on them.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">You can issue <TT>UPDATE</TT> statements and positioned <TT>DELETE</TT> statements against a declared temporary table.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">You can implicitly define the columns of a declared temporary table and use the result table from a <TT>SELECT</TT>.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">So, declared temporary tables offer much more flexibility and functionality than created temporary tables. To "create" an instance of a declared temporary table, you must issue the <TT>DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE</TT> statement inside of an application program. That instance of the declared temporary table is known only to the process that issues the <TT>DECLARE</TT> statement. Multiple concurrent programs can be executed using the same declared temporary table name because each program will have its own copy of the temporary table.<A NAME="ch05index688"></A><A NAME="ch05index689"></A></P>
<P class="docText">But there is more work required to use a declared temporary table than there is to use a created temporary table. Before you can declare temporary tables you must create a temporary database and table spaces for them to use. This is accomplished by specifying the <TT>AS TEMP</TT> clause on a <TT>CREATE DATABASE</TT> statement. Then, you must create segmented table spaces in the temporary database. Only one temporary database for declared temporary tables is permitted per DB2 subsystem.</P>
<A NAME="ch05note27"></A><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">CAUTION</p>

<P class="docText">Everyone has the <TT>CREATETAB</TT> privilege in the temporary database by default드nd you cannot <TT>REVOKE</TT> this privilege. It is implicitly granted when the temporary database is created.</P></div><br>
<P class="docText">When a <TT>DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE</TT> statement is issued, DB2 will create an empty instance of the temporary table in the temporary table space. <TT>INSERT</TT> statements are used to populate the temporary table. Once inserted, the data can be accessed, modified, or deleted. When the program completes, DB2 will drop the instance of the temporary table. Also, be aware that users of temporary tables must have been granted <TT>USE</TT> authority on the temporary table space.<A NAME="ch05index690"></A><A NAME="ch05index691"></A><A NAME="ch05index692"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The following example shows a <TT>DECLARE</TT> statement that can be issued from an application program (assuming the temporary database and table spaces already have been defined):</P>

   LASTNAME   VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
   WORKDEPT   CHAR(3),
   PHONENO    CHAR(4)
  );
</pre><BR>
<P class="docText">This creates a declared temporary table named <TT>TEMP_EMP</TT>. Additionally, you can use the <TT>LIKE</TT> clause to <TT>DECLARE</TT> a temporary table that uses the same schema definition as another currently existing table. You can use the <TT>INCLUDING IDENTITY COLUMN ATTRIBUTES</TT> clause to copy the <TT>IDENTITY</TT> columns as well. For example:</P>
<pre>

<P class="docText">This example shows how to use the <TT>INCLUDING IDENTITY</TT> clause.

Identity columns are covered later in this chapter in the section titled "<A class="docLink" HREF="#ch05lev3sec36">Sequence Objects and Identity Columns</A>."</P>
<P class="docText">Notice also the <TT>ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS</TT> clause in the previous example. The <TT>ON COMMIT</TT> clause specifies what action DB2 is to take with the data in the declared temporary table when the program issues a <TT>COMMIT</TT> statement. There are two options: <TT>PRESERVE</TT> or <TT>DELETE</TT> rows. Specifying <TT>PRESERVE ROWS</TT> indicates that the rows of the table are to be kept. Beware, though, that the <TT>PRESERVE ROWS</TT> option impacts thread reuse. You will not be able to reuse threads for any application process that contains, at its most recent <TT>COMMIT</TT>, an active declared temporary table defined using the <TT>PRESERVE ROWS</TT> option of the <TT>ON COMMIT</TT> clause. The other option, which is the default, is <TT>ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS</TT>.

<P class="docText">Well, there are a few potential problems with declared temporary tables, too. First of all, the DB2 Catalog (<TT>SYSIBM.SYSPACKDEP</TT>) will not show dependencies for declared temporary tables, but it will for created temporary tables. Second, some DBAs are leery of allowing database structures to be created by application programmers inside of an application programmer. With limited DDL and database design knowledge it may not be wise to trust programmers to get the table structure correct.

<A NAME="ch05lev4sec44"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Identity Columns</H5>
<P class="docText">Identity columns were formally added to DB2 as of Version 7, but were also made available to DB2 Version 6 as a refresh. An identity column is defined to a DB2 column using the <TT>IDENTITY</TT> parameter. A column thusly defined will cause DB2 to automatically generate a unique, sequential value for that column when a row is added to the table. For example, identity columns might be used to generate unique primary key values or a value that somewhat mimics Oracle's row number capability. Using identity columns helps to avoid some of the concurrency and performance problems that can occur when application programs are used to populate sequential values for a "counter" column.<A NAME="ch05index764"></A><A NAME="ch05index765"></A><A NAME="ch05index766"></A></P>
<P class="docText">When inserting data into a table that uses an identity column, the program or user will not provide a value for the identity column. Instead, DB2 automatically generates the appropriate value to be inserted.</P>
<P class="docText">Only one identity column can be defined per DB2 table. Additionally, the data type of the column must be <TT>SMALLINT</TT>, <TT>INTEGER</TT>, or <TT>DECIMAL</TT> with a zero scale, that is <TT>DECIMAL(</TT><span class="docEmphasis"><TT>n</TT></span><TT>,0)</TT>. The data type also can be a user-defined <TT>DISTINCT</TT> type based on one of these numeric data types. The designer has control over the starting point for the generated sequential values, and the number by which the count is incremented.</P>
<P class="docText">An example of creating a table with an identity column follows:</P>
<pre>

</pre><BR><pre>
CREATE TABLE EXAMPLE
   (ID_COL INTEGER NOT NULL
           GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY
           START WITH 100
           INCREMENT BY 10
    ...);
</pre><BR>
<P class="docText">In this example, the identity column is named <TT>ID_COL</TT>. The first value stored in the column will be 100 and subsequent <TT>INSERT</TT>s will add 10 to the last value. So the identity column values generated will be 100, 110, 120, 130, and so on.</P>
<P class="docText">Note, too, that each identity column has a property associated with it assigned using the <TT>GENERATED</TT> parameter. This parameter indicates how DB2 generates values for the column. You must specify <TT>GENERATED</TT> if the column is to be considered an identity column or the data type of the column is a <TT>ROWID</TT>. This means that DB2 must be permitted to generate values for all identity columns. There are two options for the <TT>GENERATED</TT> parameter, <TT>ALWAYS</TT> and <TT>BY DEFAULT</TT>:<A NAME="ch05index767"></A><A NAME="ch05index768"></A></P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList"><TT>GENERATED ALWAYS</TT> indicates that DB2 will always generate a value for the column when a row is inserted into the table. You will usually specify <TT>ALWAYS</TT> for your identity columns unless you are using data propagation.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><TT>GENERATED BY DEFAULT</TT> indicates that DB2 will generate a value for the column when a row is inserted into the table unless a value is specified. So, if you want to be able to insert an explicit value into an identity column you must specify <TT>GENERATED BY DEFAULT</TT>.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Additionally, you can specify what to do when the maximum value is hit. Specifying the <TT>CYCLE</TT> keyword will cause DB2 to begin generating values from the minimum value all over again. Of course, this can cause duplicate values to be generated and should only be used when uniqueness is not a requirement.</P>
<P class="docText">Sometimes it is necessary to retrieve the value of an identity column immediately after it is inserted. For example, if you are using identity columns for primary key generation you may need to retrieve the value to provide the foreign key of a child table row that is to be inserted after the primary key is generated. The <TT>IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL()</TT> function can be used to retrieve the value of an identity column after insertion. For example, run the following statement immediately after the <TT>INSERT</TT> statement that sets the identity value:<A NAME="ch05index769"></A><A NAME="ch05index770"></A><A NAME="ch05index771"></A><A NAME="ch05index772"></A></P>

<P class="docText">Similar to identity columns, a <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> object has parameters to control the starting point for the generated sequential values, and the number by which the count is incremented. You can also specify the data type to be generated (the default is <TT>INTEGER</TT>). You can also specify a minimum value (<TT>MINVALUE</TT>) and a maximum value (<TT>MAXVALUE</TT>) if you wish to have further control over the values than is provided by the data type chosen.<A NAME="ch05index805"></A><A NAME="ch05index806"></A><A NAME="ch05index807"></A><A NAME="ch05index808"></A><A NAME="ch05index809"></A><A NAME="ch05index810"></A><A NAME="ch05index811"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Again, as with identity columns, you can specify how the <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> should handle running out of values when the maximum value is hit. Specifying the <TT>CYCLE</TT> keyword will cause the <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> object to wrap around and begin generating values from the minimum value all over again.</P>
<P class="docText">A final consideration for <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> objects is caching. Sequence values can be cached in memory to facilitate better performance. The size of the cache specifies the number of sequence values that DB2 will pre-allocate in memory. In the previous example <TT>CACHE 10</TT> indicates that ten sequence values will be generated and stored in memory for subsequent use. Of course, you can turn off caching by specifying <TT>NO CACHE</TT>. With caching turned off each new request for a sequence number will cause I/O to the DB2 Catalog (<TT>SYSIBM.SYSSEQUENCES</TT>) to generate the next sequential value.</P>
<A NAME="ch05lev4sec48"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title"><TT>SEQUENCE</TT> Object Guidelines</H5>
<P class="docText">DB2 does not wait for an application that has incremented a sequence to commit before allowing the sequence to be incremented again by another application. Applications can use one sequence for many tables, or create multiple sequences for use of each table requiring generated key values. In either case, the applications control the relationship between the sequences and the tables.</P>
<P class="docText">The name of the <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> object indicates that we are going to use it to generate activity numbers (<TT>ACTNO</TT>), but its usage is not limited to that. Of course, failure to control the use of a <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> object can result in gaps in the sequential values. For example, if we use the <TT>ACTNO_SEQ</TT> object to generate a number for a different column, the next time we use it for <TT>ACTNO</TT> there will be a gap where we generated that number.<A NAME="ch05index812"></A><A NAME="ch05index813"></A><A NAME="ch05index814"></A><A NAME="ch05index815"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Other scenarios can cause gaps in a <TT>SEQUENCE</TT>, too.

<A NAME="ch05lev4sec50"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Avoid Wasted Space</H5>
<P class="docText">If you do not use very large and very small row sizes, you can reduce the amount of space wasted by unuseable bytes on the pages of a table space. Keep these rules in mind:<A NAME="ch05index828"></A><A NAME="ch05index829"></A><A NAME="ch05index830"></A><A NAME="ch05index831"></A></P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">A maximum of 255 rows can be stored on one table space page.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A row length larger than 4,056 will not fit on a 4KB page. You will need to choose one of the other allowable page sizes. Page sizes supported by DB2 include 4KB, 8KB, 16KB, and 32KB.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A row length less than 15 wastes space because no more than 255 rows can be stored on a DB2 page, regardless of the size of the row. For pre-V3 subsystems, a row length less than 31 bytes wastes space because the limit at that time was 127 rows per page.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A row length of 2,029 results in only one row per (4K) page because the second row will be too large to exist on the same page.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Determine row size carefully to avoid wasting space. If you can combine small tables or split large tables to avoid wasting a large amount of space, do so. It usually is impossible to avoid wasting some space, however.</P>
<A NAME="ch05lev4sec51"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Define All Appropriate Columns</H5>
<P class="docText">Be sure to apply normalization to your database design to arrive at the appropriate columns for each DB2 table. An introduction to normalization is forthcoming in a later section of this chapter.<A NAME="ch05index832"></A><A NAME="ch05index833"></A><A NAME="ch05index834"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Keep in mind, however, that the maximum number of columns that can be defined for a DB2 table is 750. If the table participates as a dependent to another table (referential integrity), then the maximum number of columns is reduced to 749.</P>
<P class="docText">For a table with more than 749 or 750 columns, you might need to break it into two tables, each with the same primary key, but with a different subset of the total number of columns.</P>
<A NAME="ch05lev4sec52"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Choose Meaningful Column Names</H5>
<P class="docText">In many data processing shops, common names for data elements have been used for years.

For V7 and prior releases the maximum size of a column name is 18 bytes. You can enhance the useability of your applications if you use as many characters as necessary to achieve easy-to-understand column names. For example, use <TT>CUSTOMER_NAME</TT> instead of <TT>CNA0</TT> for a customer name column. Do not use column names simply because people are accustomed to them.</P></td></tr></table><br>
<P class="docText">This might be a tough sell in your organization, but it's well worth the effort. If you must support the older, non-descriptive names, consider creating tables with the fully descriptive names and then creating views of these tables with the old names.

<P class="docText">Every shop uses abbreviated data names. This isn't a bad practice듯nless the specification of abbreviations is random, uncontrolled, or unplanned.

<A NAME="ch05lev4sec54"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Sequence Columns to Achieve Optimal Performance</H5>
<P class="docText">The sequencing of columns in a table is not important from a functionality perspective because the relational model states that columns must be non-positional. Columns and rows do not need to be sequenced for the retrieval commands to work on tables.<A NAME="ch05index843"></A><A NAME="ch05index844"></A><A NAME="ch05index845"></A><A NAME="ch05index846"></A><A NAME="ch05index847"></A></P>
<P class="docText">When you create a table, however, you must supply the columns in a particular order, and that becomes the order in which they physically are stored. The columns then can be retrieved in any order using the appropriate SQL <TT>SELECT</TT> statement.</P>
<P class="docText">When creating your tables, you will get better performance if you sequence the columns with an understanding of how DB2 logs. When data is modified in your database, DB2 will log every change made (in most circumstances). At a high level, this is how DB2 logs:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">For fixed-length rows, DB2 logs from the first byte changed to the last byte changed.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">For variable-length rows in which the size of the row changes due to the modification, DB2 logs from the first byte changed to the end of the row.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">For variable-length rows in which the size of the row does not change, DB2 logs from the first byte changed to the last byte changed.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">"So what?" you may be asking. Logging can cause a significant performance bottleneck. You can optimize performance by sequencing your columns such that you minimize the amount of data logged. The less data DB2 needs to log, the better the performance of your data modification operations will be. So, follow these rules for column sequencing:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">Place the primary key columns first to ease identification.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Place infrequently updated non-variable columns next.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Place infrequently updated variable columns after the infrequently updated non- variable columns.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Consider placing columns that are frequently modified at the same time next to one another in sequence in the table. This can help to reduce the amount of data that is logged. Do so even if it does not "appear" to be an elegant design; for example, if the <TT>MIDDLE_INITIAL</TT> column is often updated at the same time as the <TT>PHONE_NUMBER</TT> column, place the two columns contiguously next to each other. Even though it might "look nicer" to put the <TT>LAST_NAME</TT> column after <TT>MIDDLE_INITIAL</TT>, performance can be improved in this scenario by putting <TT>PHONE_NUMBER</TT> after <TT>MIDDLE_INITIAL</TT>.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Only then, and given the preceding constraints, try to sequence the columns in an order that makes sense to the users of the table.<A NAME="ch05index848"></A><A NAME="ch05index849"></A><A NAME="ch05index850"></A><A NAME="ch05index851"></A><A NAME="ch05index852"></A></P></LI></UL>

<A NAME="ch05lev4sec55"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Avoid Special Sequencing for Nullable Columns</H5>
<P class="docText">Treat nullable columns the same as you would any other column. Some DBAs advise you to place nullable columns of the same data type after non-nullable columns. This is supposed to assist in administering the null columns, but in my opinion it does not. Sequencing nullable columns in this manner provides no clear benefit and should be avoided.<A NAME="ch05index853"></A><A NAME="ch05index854"></A><A NAME="ch05index855"></A></P>
<P class="docText">See the "<A class="docLink" HREF="#ch05lev2sec9">DB2 Table Parameters</A>" section in this chapter for additional advice on nullable columns and <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>, "Data Manipulation Guidelines," for advice on accessing nullable columns.</P>
<A NAME="ch05lev4sec56"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Use Nulls with Care</H5>
<P class="docText">A null is DB2's attempt to record missing or unknown information. When you assign a null to a column instance, it means that a value currently does not exist for the column. It's important to understand that a column assigned to null logically means one of two things: The column does not apply to this row, or the column applies to this row, but the information is not known at present.<A NAME="ch05index856"></A><A NAME="ch05index857"></A><A NAME="ch05index858"></A><A NAME="ch05index859"></A><A NAME="ch05index860"></A></P>
<P class="docText">For example, suppose that a table contains information on the hair color of employees. The <TT>HAIR_COLOR</TT> column is defined in the table as being capable of accepting nulls. Three new employees are added today: a man with black hair, a woman with unknown hair color, and a bald man. The woman with the unknown hair color and the bald man both could be assigned null <TT>HAIR_COLOR</TT>, but for different reasons. The hair column color for the woman would be null because she has hair but the color presently is unknown. The hair color column for the bald man would be null also, but this is because he has no hair and so hair color does not apply.</P>
<P class="docText">DB2 does not differentiate between nulls that signify unknown data and those that signify inapplicable data. This distinction must be made by the program logic of each application.</P>
<P class="docText">DB2 represents null in a special hidden column known as an <span class="docEmphasis">indicator variable</span>. An indicator variable is defined to DB2 for each column that can accept nulls. The indicator variable is transparent to an end user, but must be provided for when programming in a host language (such as COBOL or PL/I). Every column defined to a DB2 table must be designated as either allowing or disallowing nulls.<A NAME="ch05index861"></A><A NAME="ch05index862"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The default definition for columns in a DB2 table is to allow nulls. Nulls can be prohibited for a column by specifying the <TT>NOT NULL</TT> or <TT>NOT NULL WITH DEFAULT</TT> option in the <TT>CREATE TABLE</TT> statement.</P>
<P class="docText">Avoid nulls in columns that must participate in arithmetic logic (for example, <TT>DECIMAL</TT> money values). The <TT>AVG</TT>, <TT>COUNT DISTINCT</TT>, <TT>SUM</TT>, <TT>MAX</TT>, and <TT>MIN</TT> functions omit column occurrences set to null. The <TT>COUNT(*)</TT> function, however, does not omit columns set to null because it operates on rows. Thus, <TT>AVG</TT> is not equal to <TT>SUM/COUNT(*)</TT> when the average is being computed for a column that can contain nulls. If the <TT>COMM</TT> column is nullable, the result of the following queries are not the same</P>

</pre><BR>
<P class="docText">For this reason, avoid nulls in columns involved in math functions.</P>
<P class="docText">When <TT>DATE</TT>, <TT>TIME</TT>, and <TT>TIMESTAMP</TT> columns can be unknown, assign them as nullable. DB2 checks to ensure that only valid dates, times, and timestamps are placed in columns defined as such. If the column can be unknown, it must be defined to be nullable because the default for these columns is the current date, current time, and current timestamp (unless explicitly defined otherwise using the <TT>DEFAULT</TT> clause). Null, therefore, is the only available option for the recording of missing dates, times, and timestamps.</P>
<P class="docText">For every other column, determine whether nullability can be of benefit before allowing nulls. Consider these rules:<A NAME="ch05index863"></A><A NAME="ch05index864"></A><A NAME="ch05index865"></A><A NAME="ch05index866"></A><A NAME="ch05index867"></A></P>

<A NAME="ch05lev4sec57"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Define Columns Across Tables in the Same Way</H5>
<P class="docText">When a column that defines the same attribute as another column is given a different column name, data administrators refer it to as a <span class="docEmphasis">column synonym</span>. In general, column synonyms should be avoided except in the situations detailed in this guideline.<A NAME="ch05index883"></A><A NAME="ch05index884"></A><A NAME="ch05index885"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Every attribute should be defined in one way, that is, with one distinct name and one distinct data type and length. The name should be different only if the same attribute needs to be represented as a column in one table more than once, or if the practical meaning of the attribute differs as a column from table to table. For example, suppose that a database contains a table that holds the colors of items. This column is called Color. The same database has a table with a Preferred Color column for customers. This is the same logical attribute, but its meaning changes based on the context. It is not wise to simply call the column Color in the Customer table, because it would imply that the customer is that color!</P>
<P class="docText">An attribute must be defined twice in self-referencing tables and in tables requiring multiple foreign key references to a single table. In these situations, create a standard prefixing or suffixing mechanism for the multiple columns. After you define the mechanism, stick to it. For example, the <TT>DSN8810.DEPT</TT> table in <A class="docLink" HREF="app01.html#app01">Appendix A</A>, "DB2 Sample Tables," is a self-referencing table that does not follow these recommendations. The <TT>ADMRDEPT</TT> column represents the same attribute as the <TT>DEPTNO</TT> column, but the name is not consistent. A better name for the column would have been <TT>ADMR_DEPTNO</TT>. This adds the <TT>ADMR</TT> prefix to the attribute name, <TT>DEPTNO</TT>.</P>
<P class="docText">The practical meaning of columns that represent the same attribute can differ from table to table as well. In the sample tables, for example, the <TT>MGRNO</TT> column in the <TT>DSN8810.DEPT</TT> table represents the same attribute as the <TT>EMPNO</TT> column in the <TT>DSN8810.EMP</TT> table. The two columns can be named differently in this situation because the employee number in the <TT>DEPT</TT> table represents a manager, whereas the employee number in the <TT>EMP</TT> table represents any employee. (Perhaps the <TT>MGRNO</TT> column should have been named <TT>MGR_EMPNO</TT>.)</P>
<P class="docText">The sample tables provide another example of when this guideline should have been followed, but wasn't. Consider the same two tables: <TT>DSN8810.DEPT</TT> and <TT>DSN8810.EMP</TT>. Both contain the department number attribute. In the <TT>DEPT</TT> table, the column representing this attribute is <TT>DEPTNO</TT>, but in the <TT>EMP</TT> table, the column is <TT>WORKDEPT</TT>. This is confusing and should be avoided. In this instance, both should have been named <TT>DEPTNO</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Using DB2 compression, you can achieve similar results as with <TT>VARCHAR</TT> columns.

<A NAME="ch05lev4sec71"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Consider Using Odd <TT>DECIMAL</TT> Precision</H5>
<P class="docText">Think about making the precision of all <TT>DECIMAL</TT> columns odd. This can provide an extra digit for the column being defined without using additional storage. For example, consider a column that must have a precision of 6 with a scale of 2. This would be defined as <TT>DECIMAL(6,2)</TT>. By defining the column as <TT>DECIMAL(7,2)</TT> instead, numbers up to 99999.99 can be stored instead of numbers up to 9999.99. This can save future expansion efforts.<A NAME="ch05index980"></A><A NAME="ch05index981"></A><A NAME="ch05index982"></A></P>
<P class="docText">However, if you must ensure that the data in the column conforms to the specified domain (that is, even precision), specify even precision.</P>
<A NAME="ch05lev4sec72"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">Consider All Options When Defining Columns As <TT>INTEGER</TT></H5>
<P class="docText">Use <TT>SMALLINT</TT> instead of <TT>INTEGER</TT> when the 32,768 to 32,767 range of values is appropriate. This data type usually is a good choice for sequencing type columns. The range of allowable values for the <TT>INTEGER</TT> data type is 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. These ranges might seem arbitrary, but are designed to store the maximum amount of information in the minimum amount of space. A <TT>SMALLINT</TT> column occupies 2 bytes, and an <TT>INTEGER</TT> column occupies only 4 bytes.<A NAME="ch05index983"></A><A NAME="ch05index984"></A><A NAME="ch05index985"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The alternative to <TT>SMALLINT</TT> and <TT>INTEGER</TT> data types is <TT>DECIMAL</TT> with a 0 scale. <TT>DECIMAL(5,0)</TT> supports the same range as <TT>SMALLINT</TT>, and <TT>DECIMAL(10,0)</TT> supports the same range as <TT>INTEGER</TT>. The <TT>DECIMAL</TT> equivalent of <TT>SMALLINT</TT> occupies 3 bytes of storage but permits values as large as 99,999 instead of only 32,767. The <TT>DECIMAL</TT> equivalent of <TT>INTEGER</TT> occupies 6 bytes but permits values as large as 9,999,999,999 instead of 2,147,483,647.</P>
<P class="docText">When deciding whether to use <TT>DECIMAL</TT> without scale to represent integer columns, another factor is control over the domain of acceptable values. The domain of <TT>SMALLINT</TT> and <TT>INTEGER</TT> columns is indicated by the range of allowable values for their respective data types. If you must ensure conformance to a domain, <TT>DECIMAL</TT> without scale provides the better control.</P>
<P class="docText">Suppose that you code a column called <TT>DAYS_ABSENT</TT> that indicates the number of days absent for employees in the <TT>DSN8810.EMP</TT> table. Suppose too that an employee cannot miss more than five days per year without being disciplined and that no one misses ten or more days. In this case, a single digit integer column could support the requirements for <TT>DAYS_ABSENT</TT>. A <TT>DECIMAL(1,0)</TT> column would occupy 2 bytes of physical storage and provide for values ranging from 9 to 9. By contrast, a <TT>SMALLINT</TT> column would occupy two bytes of physical storage and provide for values ranging from 32768 to 32,767. The <TT>DECIMAL(1,0)</TT> column, however, more closely matches the domain for the <TT>DAYS_ABSENT</TT> columns.</P>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRoman">One final consideration</span>: 
A decimal point is required with <TT>DECIMAL</TT> data, even when the data has no scale. For example, the integer 5 is 5, when expressed as a decimal. This can be confusing to programmers and users who are accustomed to dealing with integer data without a decimal point.</p>
<P class="docText">Consider all these factors when deciding whether to implement <TT>SMALLINT</TT>, <TT>INTEGER</TT>, or <TT>DECIMAL</TT> data types for integer columns.<A NAME="ch05index986"></A><A NAME="ch05index987"></A><A NAME="ch05index988"></A></P>

Such data types can be used to store much larger multimedia data than can be stored in <TT>VARGRAPHIC</TT> or <TT>VARCHAR</TT> columns.
