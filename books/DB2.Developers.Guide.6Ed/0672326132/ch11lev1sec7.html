<A NAME="ch11lev4sec46"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Avoid "Black Boxes"</H4>
<P class="docText">Often, DB2 professionals are confronted with the "black box" approach to database access. The basic idea behind a "black box" is that instead of having programs issue direct requests to the database, they will make requests of a "black box" data engine. This "black box" program is designed to accept parameter-driven requests and then issue common SQL statements to return results to the program.<A NAME="ch11index465"></A><A NAME="ch11index466"></A></P>
<P class="docText">So, a black box is a database access program that sits in between your application programs and DB2. It is designed so that <span class="docEmphBoldItalic">all</span> application programs call the black box for data instead of containing their own embedded SQL statements. The general idea behind such a contraption is that it will simplify DB2 development, because programmers will not need to know how to write SQL. Instead, the programmer just calls the black box program to request whatever data is required. SQL statements become calls—and every programmer knows how to code a call, right?</P>
<P class="docText">Basically, proponents of the "black box" solution believe that access to data by calling a program with parameters is easier than learning SQL. But the "black box" approach is complete rubbish and should be avoided at all costs. The proper way to formulate requests for DB2 data is by coding well-designed, efficient SQL statements. A "black box" will never be able to completely mimic the functionality of SQL. Furthermore, the "black box" approach is sure to cause performance problems because it will have been coded for multiple users and will forgo the efficient SQL design techniques discussed in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>, "Data Manipulation Guidelines."</P>
<P class="docText">For example, what if the data access requirements of the programs calling the "black box" call for the following:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">One program requires three columns from <TT>TABLE1</TT></P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A second program requires two columns from <TT>TABLE1</TT></P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Two additional programs require four columns from <TT>TABLE1</TT></P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A fifth program requires all of the columns from <TT>TABLE1</TT></P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">In this case, the "black box" is almost sure to be designed with a single SQL <TT>SELECT</TT> that returns all of the columns from <TT>TABLE1</TT>. But, based on which program calls the "black box," only the required rows would be returned. We know this is bad SQL design because we should always return the absolute minimum number of columns and rows per SQL <TT>SELECT</TT> statement to optimize performance. But even if four different <TT>SELECT</TT> statements were used by the "black box," if requirements change, so must the "black box." The additional maintenance required for the "black box" program adds unneeded administrative overhead. Furthermore, the "black box" program is a single-point-of-failure for any application that uses it.</P>
<P class="docText">Perhaps more importantly, using a "black box" always consumes more CPU than simply using embedded SQL statements in your program. The black box application requires additional lines of code to be executed than would be without the black box. It is elementary when you think about it. The <TT>CALL</TT> statement in the calling program is extra, and the code surrounding the statements in the black box that ties them together is extra. None of this is required if you just plug your SQL statements right into your application programs.</P>
<P class="docText">This extra code must be compiled and executed. When extra code is required (no matter how little or efficient it may be) extra CPU will be expended to run the application. More code means more work, and that means degraded performance.</P>
<P class="docText">All in all, "black boxes" provide no benefit but at significant cost. Application programs should be designed using SQL to access DB2 data. No "black boxes" should be allowed.<A NAME="ch11index467"></A><A NAME="ch11index468"></A></P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec47"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Code Modular DB2 Programs</H4>
<P class="docText">You should design DB2 programs to be modular. One program should accomplish a single, well-defined task. If you need to execute multiple tasks, structure the programs so that tasks can be strung together by having the programs call one another. This approach is preferable to a single, large program that accomplishes many tasks for two reasons. First, single tasks in separate programs make the programs easier to understand and maintain. Second, if each task can be executed either alone or with other tasks, isolating the tasks in a program enables easier execution of any single task or list of tasks.<A NAME="ch11index469"></A><A NAME="ch11index470"></A></P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec48"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Minimize the Size of DB2 Programs</H4>
<P class="docText">Code DB2 programs to be as small as possible. Streamlining your application code to remove unnecessary statements results in better performance. This recommendation goes hand-in-hand with the preceding one.<A NAME="ch11index471"></A><A NAME="ch11index472"></A><A NAME="ch11index473"></A></P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec49"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Consider Stored Procedures for Reuseability</H4>
<P class="docText">When you're modularizing a DB2 application, do so with an eye toward reuseability. Whenever a particular task must be performed across many programs, applications, or systems, consider developing a stored procedure. A stored procedure, after it is created, can be called from multiple applications. However, when you modify the code, you need to modify only the stored procedure code, not each individual program.<A NAME="ch11index474"></A><A NAME="ch11index475"></A><A NAME="ch11index476"></A></P>
<P class="docText">For more information on stored procedures, refer to <A class="docLink" HREF="ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</A>.</P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec50"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Consider User-Defined Functions for Reuseability</H4>
<P class="docText">If your organization relies on business rules that transform data, consider implementing user-defined functions. Data transformation tasks that are performed by many programs, applications, or systems, can benefit from the reuseability aspects of user-defined functions. Consider developing user-defined functions for the business rule and then using it in subsequent SQL statements. This reuse is preferable to coding the business rule into multiple applications because<A NAME="ch11index477"></A><A NAME="ch11index478"></A><A NAME="ch11index479"></A></P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">You can be sure the same code is being used in all programs.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">You can optimize the performance of the UDF and impact multiple programs at once, instead of requiring massive logic changes in many programs.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">When the rule changes, you need to modify the UDF once, not in each individual program.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">For more information on user-defined functions, refer to <A class="docLink" HREF="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</A>, "Using DB2 User-Defined Functions and Data Types."</P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec51"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Be Aware of Active Database Constructs</H4>
<P class="docText">You can create active DB2 databases using features such as referential integrity and triggers. An active database takes action based on changes to the state of the data stored in it. For example, if a row is deleted, subsequent activity automatically occurs (such as enforcing a <TT>DELETE CASCADE</TT> referential constraint or an <TT>INSERT</TT> trigger firing that causes other data to be modified).<A NAME="ch11index480"></A><A NAME="ch11index481"></A><A NAME="ch11index482"></A></P>
<P class="docText">You need to be aware of the active database features that have been implemented to appropriately code DB2 application programs. This awareness is required because you need to know the processes that the database itself will automatically perform so your application programs do not repeat the process.</P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec52"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Use Unqualified SQL</H4>
<P class="docText">Use unqualified table, view, synonym, and alias names in application programs. This way, you can ease the process of moving programs, plans, and packages from the test environment to the production environment. If tables are explicitly qualified in an application program, and tables are qualified differently in test DB2 than they are in production DB2, programs must be modified before they are turned over to an operational production application.<A NAME="ch11index483"></A><A NAME="ch11index484"></A><A NAME="ch11index485"></A></P>
<P class="docText">When the program is bound, the tables are qualified by one of the following:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">If neither the <TT>OWNER</TT> nor <TT>QUALIFIER</TT> parameter is specified, tables are qualified by the userid of the binding agent.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">If only the <TT>OWNER</TT> is specified, tables are qualified by the token specified in the <TT>OWNER</TT> parameter.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">If a <TT>QUALIFIER</TT> is specified, all tables are qualified by the token specified to that parameter.</P></LI></UL>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec53"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Avoid <TT>SELECT *</TT></H4>
<P class="docText">Never use <TT>SELECT *</TT> in an embedded SQL program. Request each column that needs to be accessed. Also, follow the SQL coding recommendations in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>.<A NAME="ch11index486"></A><A NAME="ch11index487"></A><A NAME="ch11index488"></A></P>

<P class="docText">Joining tables by application logic requires additional code and is usually less efficient than an SQL join. When data will be updated in a cursor-controlled fashion, favor application joining over SQL joining because the results of an SQL join are not always updated directly. When you're updating the result rows of an application join, remember to code <TT>FOR UPDATE OF</TT> on each cursor, specifying every column that can be updated. When you're only reading the data without subsequent modification, remember to code <TT>FOR READ ONLY</TT> (or <TT>FOR FETCH ONLY</TT>) on the cursor.<A NAME="ch11index502"></A><A NAME="ch11index503"></A><A NAME="ch11index504"></A><A NAME="ch11index505"></A><A NAME="ch11index506"></A></P>

<P class="docText">Individual SQL statements can specify a different, appropriate isolation level. Although each DB2 plan and package has an isolation level, you can override it for individual SQL statements by using the <TT>WITH</TT> clause. You can specify the <TT>WITH</TT> clause for the following types of SQL statements:<A NAME="ch11index542"></A><A NAME="ch11index543"></A><A NAME="ch11index544"></A></P>

<P class="docText">Valid options are as follow:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList"><TT>RR</TT> and <TT>RR KEEP UPDATE LOCKS</TT> (Repeatable Read)</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><TT>RS</TT> and <TT>RS KEEP UPDATE LOCKS</TT> (Read Stability)</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><TT>CS</TT> (Cursor Stability)</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><TT>UR</TT> (Uncommitted Read)</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">The <TT>KEEP UPDATE LOCKS</TT> clause was added as of DB2 V5. It indicates that DB2 is to acquire <TT>X</TT> locks instead of <TT>U</TT> or <TT>S</TT> locks on all qualifying rows or pages. Use <TT>KEEP UPDATE LOCKS</TT> sparingly. Although it can better serialize updates, it can reduce concurrency.</P>

<P class="docText">IBM provides source code in several host languages for various sample application programs. This source code is in a PDS library named <TT>SYS1.DB2V8R1.DSNSAMP</TT> (or something similar) supplied with the DB2 system software. Samples of COBOL, PL/I, FORTRAN, Assembler, and C programs for TSO, CICS, and IMS are available in the aforementioned library.<A NAME="ch11index545"></A><A NAME="ch11index546"></A></P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec67"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Favor Complex SQL for Performance</H4>
<P class="docText">When embedding SQL in application programs, developers are sometimes tempted to break up complex SQL statements into smaller, easier-to-understand SQL statements and combine them together using program logic. Avoid this approach. When SQL is properly coded, DB2 is almost always more efficient than equivalent application code when it comes to accessing and updating DB2 data.<A NAME="ch11index547"></A><A NAME="ch11index548"></A><A NAME="ch11index549"></A></P>
