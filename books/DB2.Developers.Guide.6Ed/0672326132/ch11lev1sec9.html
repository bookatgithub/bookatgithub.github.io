<P class="docText">When you're joining rows, try to limit the number of rows returned by the transaction. There is a practical limit to the amount of data that a user can assimilate while sitting in front of a computer screen. Whenever possible, set a low limit on the number of rows returned (for example, approximately 125 rows, or 5 screens of data). For data intensive applications, adjust this total, as required, with the understanding that performance may degrade as additional data is accessed and returned to the screen.<A NAME="ch11index644"></A><A NAME="ch11index645"></A><A NAME="ch11index646"></A></P>

In reality, DB2 allowed up to 15 query blocks per SQL statement, and each query block could reference up to 15 tables—thus, 15 x 15 = 225. As of DB2 V8, you can reference 225 tables in each SQL statement without worrying about the number of query blocks.</P></div><br>

<P class="docText">To reduce online data sorting, try to avoid using <TT>GROUP BY</TT>, <TT>ORDER BY</TT>, <TT>DISTINCT</TT>, and <TT>UNION</TT> unless appropriate indexes are available. Of course, if your transaction absolutely requires sorting (to return data in a particular sequence, to group columns, or to remove duplicates), then perform the sort in DB2. Doing so will almost always outperform returning the data and sorting it in the program logic (or using an external sort package, such as DFSORT or Syncsort).<A NAME="ch11index647"></A><A NAME="ch11index648"></A><A NAME="ch11index649"></A><A NAME="ch11index650"></A></P>

<A NAME="ch11lev4sec86"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Minimize Cascading <TT>DELETE</TT>s</H4>
<P class="docText">Avoid online deletion of parent table rows involved in referential constraints specifying the <TT>CASCADE</TT> delete rule. When a row in the parent table is deleted, multiple deletes in dependent tables can occur. This result degrades online performance.<A NAME="ch11index657"></A><A NAME="ch11index658"></A><A NAME="ch11index659"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Keep in mind that as of V6, triggers also can cause cascading data modification. Be sure to include the impact of triggers when analyzing the overall impact referential integrity-invoked cascading deletes can cause.</P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec87"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Be Aware of Overactive Data Areas</H4>
<P class="docText">An <span class="docEmphasis">overactive</span> data area is a portion of a table or index that is accessed and updated considerably more than other tables (or portions thereof) in the online application. Be aware of overactive data areas.<A NAME="ch11index660"></A><A NAME="ch11index661"></A><A NAME="ch11index662"></A><A NAME="ch11index663"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Overactive data areas are characterized by the following features: a relatively small number of pages (usually 10 pages or fewer, and sometimes only 1 row), and a large volume of retrievals and updates (usually busy more than half the time that the online application is active).</P>
<P class="docText">Overactive data areas can be caused, for example, by using a table with one row (or a small number of rows) to assign sequential numbers for columns in other tables or files; or by using a table to store counters, totals, or averages of values stored in other tables or files. You also can cause overactive data areas when you use tables to implement domains that are volatile or heavily accessed by the online system. These situations cause many different programs to access and modify a small amount of data over and over. An inordinate number of resource unavailable and timeout abends can be caused by overactive data areas unless they are monitored and maintained.</P>
<P class="docText">Reduce the impact of overactive data areas by designing transactions with the following characteristics:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">Issue <TT>OPEN</TT>, <TT>FETCH</TT>, <TT>UPDATE</TT>, and <TT>CLOSE</TT> cursor statements (hereafter referred to as <span class="docEmphasis">update sequences</span>) as close to each other as possible.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Invoke update sequences as rapidly as possible in the transaction; in other words, do not place unrelated operations in the series of instructions that update the overactive data area.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Code as few intervening instructions as possible between the <TT>OPEN</TT>, <TT>FETCH</TT>, and <TT>CLOSE</TT> statements.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Place the update sequence as close to the transaction commit point as possible (that is, near the end of the transaction code).</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Isolate the active range to a single partition (or several partitions). Assign the partitions to a dedicated buffer pool (perhaps with a related hiperspace) and to a device and controller that has excess capacity during peak periods.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Try to use DDL options to reduce the impact of overactive data areas and increase concurrent access. You can do so by increasing free space on the table space and indexes for the tables or by increasing the MAXROWS table space parameter (or adding a large column to the end of the row for each table thus reducing the number of rows per page).<A NAME="ch11index664"></A><A NAME="ch11index665"></A><A NAME="ch11index666"></A><A NAME="ch11index667"></A></P></LI></UL>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec88"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Consider Using <TT>TIMESTAMP</TT> for Sequencing</H4>
<P class="docText">Sometimes you will need to automatically set the value for a column. Consider using <TT>TIMESTAMP</TT> data types instead of sequentially assigned numbers. You can generate timestamps automatically using the <TT>CURRENT TIMESTAMP</TT> special register (or the <TT>NOT NULL WITH DEFAULT</TT> option). A timestamp column has the same basic functionality as a sequentially assigned number, without the requirement of designing a table to assign sequential numbers. Remember, a table with a sequencing column can cause an overactive data area.<A NAME="ch11index668"></A><A NAME="ch11index669"></A><A NAME="ch11index670"></A></P>
<P class="docText">A column defined with the <TT>TIMESTAMP</TT> data type is marked by the date and time (down to the microsecond) that the row was inserted or updated. These numbers are serial unless updates occur across multiple time zones. Although duplicate timestamps can be generated if two transactions are entered at the same microsecond, this circumstance is rare. You can eliminate this possibility by coding a unique index on the column and checking for a <TT>-803 SQLCODE</TT> (duplicate index entry).</P>
<P class="docText">The only other drawback is the size of the timestamp data type. Although physically stored as only 10 bytes, the timestamp data is presented to the user as a 26-byte field. If users must remember the key, a timestamp usually does not suffice.</P>
<P class="docText">A common workaround for numbers that must be random is to use the microsecond portion of the timestamp as a random number generator to create keys automatically, without the need for a table to assign them. Note, though, that these numbers will not be sequenced by order of input.</P>

<P class="docText">At times it is necessary for an application to have a column that stores sequential values. For every new row that is inserted, the previous value needs to be incremented and then stored in the new row. DB2 provides two mechanisms for automatically generating these sequential values: <TT>IDENTITY</TT> columns and <TT>SEQUENCE</TT> objects.<A NAME="ch11index671"></A><A NAME="ch11index672"></A><A NAME="ch11index673"></A><A NAME="ch11index674"></A></P>

<A NAME="ch11lev4sec90"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Consider Using <TT>ROWID</TT> for Direct Row Access</H4>
<P class="docText">When the table you need to access contains a <TT>ROWID</TT> column, you can use that column to directly access a row without using an index or a table space scan. DB2 can directly access the row because the <TT>ROWID</TT> column contains the location of the row. Direct row access is very efficient.<A NAME="ch11index679"></A><A NAME="ch11index680"></A><A NAME="ch11index681"></A><A NAME="ch11index682"></A><A NAME="ch11index683"></A><A NAME="ch11index684"></A><A NAME="ch11index685"></A></P>
<P class="docText">To use direct row access, you must first <TT>SELECT</TT> the row using traditional methods. DB2 will either use an index or a scan to retrieve the row the first time. Be sure to retrieve the <TT>ROWID</TT> column and store it in a host variable. After the row has been accessed once, the <TT>ROWID</TT> column can be used to directly access the row again. Simply include a predicate in the <TT>WHERE</TT> clause for the <TT>ROWID</TT> column, such as the following:</P>
<pre>

</pre><BR><pre>
WHERE ROWID_COL = :HVROWID
</pre><BR>
<P class="docText">Of course, DB2 may revert to an access type other than direct row access if it determines that the row location has changed. You must plan for the possibility that DB2 will not choose to use direct row access, even if it indicates its intent to do so during <TT>EXPLAIN</TT>. If the predicate you are using to do direct row access is not indexable, and if DB2 is unable to use direct row access, a table space scan will be used instead. This can negatively impact performance.</P>
<P class="docText">For a query to qualify for direct row access, the search condition must be a stage 1 predicate of one of the following forms:</P>

<P class="docText">Additionally, do not attempt to use <TT>ROWID</TT> values across tables, even if those tables are exact shadow copies. The <TT>ROWID</TT> values will not be the same across tables.</P></div><br>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec91"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Do Not <TT>INSERT</TT> into Empty Tables</H4>
<P class="docText">Avoid inserting rows into empty tables in an online environment. Doing so causes multiple I/Os when you're updating indexes and causes index page splits. If you must insert rows into an empty table, consider one of the following options. You can format the table by prefilling it with index keys that can be updated online instead of inserted. This way, you can reduce I/O and eliminate index page splitting because the index is not updated.<A NAME="ch11index691"></A><A NAME="ch11index692"></A><A NAME="ch11index693"></A><A NAME="ch11index694"></A><A NAME="ch11index695"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Another option is to partition the table so that inserts are grouped into separate partitions. This method does not reduce I/O, but it can limit page splitting because the index updates are spread across multiple index data sets instead of confined to just one.</P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec92"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Increase Concurrent Online Access</H4>
<P class="docText">Limit deadlock and timeout situations by coding applications to increase their concurrency. One option is to code all transactions to access tables in the same order. For example, do not sequentially access departments in alphabetical order by <TT>DEPTNAME</TT> in one transaction, from highest to lowest <TT>DEPTNO</TT> in another, and from lowest to highest <TT>DEPTNO</TT> in yet another. Try to limit the sequential access to a table to a single method.<A NAME="ch11index696"></A><A NAME="ch11index697"></A><A NAME="ch11index698"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Another option is to update and delete using the <TT>WHERE CURRENT OF</TT> cursor option instead of using independent <TT>UPDATE</TT> and <TT>DELETE</TT> statements. A third option for increasing online throughput is to plan batch activity in online tables during inactive or off-peak periods.</P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec93"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Consider Saving Modifications Until the End of the UOW</H4>
<P class="docText">You can write an application program so that all modifications occur at the end of each unit of work instead of spreading them throughout the program. Because modifications do not actually occur until the end of the unit of work, the placement of the actual SQL modification statements is of no consequence to the eventual results of the program. If you place inserts, updates, and deletes at the end of the unit of work, the duration of locks held decreases. This technique can have a significant positive impact on concurrency and application performance.<A NAME="ch11index699"></A><A NAME="ch11index700"></A></P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec94"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Use <TT>OPTIMIZE FOR 1 ROW</TT> to Disable List Prefetch</H4>
<P class="docText">Turning off list prefetch for online applications that display data on a page-by-page basis is often desirable. When you use list prefetch, DB2 acquires a list of RIDs from matching index entries, sorts the RIDs, and then accesses data pages using the RID list. The overhead associated with list prefetch usually causes performance degradation in an online, paging environment. <TT>OPTIMIZE FOR 1 ROW</TT> disables list prefetch and enhances performance.<A NAME="ch11index701"></A><A NAME="ch11index702"></A><A NAME="ch11index703"></A><A NAME="ch11index704"></A></P>
<A NAME="ch11lev4sec95"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Implement a Repositioning Cursor for Online Browsing</H4>
<P class="docText">Use repositioning techniques, similar to those discussed for repositioning batch cursors, to permit online browsing and scrolling of retrieved rows by a primary key. Implement this cursor to reposition using a single column key:<A NAME="ch11index705"></A><A NAME="ch11index706"></A><A NAME="ch11index707"></A></P>
