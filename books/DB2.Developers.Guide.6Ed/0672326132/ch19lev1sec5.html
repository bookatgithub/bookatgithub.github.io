<P class="docText">To enable data sharing, a common DB2 catalog is required. IBM does not provide an automated mechanism for merging data from multiple existing DB2 subsystems. The process of merging systems is complex and should not be undertaken lightly. Merging subsystems is not solely a physical data movement problem but includes other administrative issues including the creation and enforcement of naming standards, DB2 security and authorization, backup and recovery, utility execution, data distribution, and on and on. Indeed, the decision to merge subsystems into a data sharing group will impact almost every aspect of database administration for the subsystems involved.<A NAME="ch19index149"></A><A NAME="ch19index150"></A><A NAME="ch19index151"></A><A NAME="ch19index152"></A><A NAME="ch19index153"></A><A NAME="ch19index154"></A><A NAME="ch19index155"></A></P>
<P class="docText">If you are still interested in merging pre-existing DB2 subsystems into a data sharing, an exhaustive 16 step process for merging data from individual DB2 subsystems is available in the IBM manual <span class="docEmphasis">Data Sharing: Planning and Administration</span> (SC26-9935).</P>

<P class="docText">Watch for duplicate object names when merging multiple DB2 catalogs into the shared DB2 catalog for the data sharing group. Because the objects were originally created in isolation from one another, it is likely that duplicate object names (for example, databases, tablespaces, indexes, and so on) may be encountered when catalogs are merged.</P></div><br>
<A NAME="ch19lev2sec9"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">Backup and Recovery</H4>
<P class="docText">Each DB2 member still maintains its own recovery logs and BSDS data sets. Each DB2 member must be able to read the logs of every other data sharing group member. This is required because logs from multiple members may be required to do media recovery for a single member. If logs are required from multiple members, the multiple logs are merged together during the recovery process.<A NAME="ch19index156"></A><A NAME="ch19index157"></A><A NAME="ch19index158"></A><A NAME="ch19index159"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Log Record Sequence Numbers (LRSN) are used to provide common log record sequencing across members.

<P class="docText">The <TT>LPL</TT> status stands for "Logical page list." It indicates that some pages were not read from or written to the group buffer pool.
