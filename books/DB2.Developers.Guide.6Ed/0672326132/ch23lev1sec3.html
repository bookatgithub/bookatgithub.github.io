<A NAME="ch23lev3sec1"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Implementing Dirty Reads Using <TT>ISOLATION(UR)</TT></H5>
<P class="docText">Programs that read DB2 data typically access numerous rows during their execution and are thus quite susceptible to concurrency problems. DB2 provides read-through locks, also known as "dirty reads" or "uncommitted reads," to help overcome concurrency problems. When using uncommitted reads, an application program can read data that has been changed but is not yet committed.<A NAME="ch23index47"></A><A NAME="ch23index48"></A><A NAME="ch23index49"></A><A NAME="ch23index50"></A><A NAME="ch23index51"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Dirty read capability is implemented using the <TT>UR</TT> isolation level (<TT>UR</TT> stands for uncommitted read). When an application program uses the <TT>UR</TT> isolation level, it reads data without taking locks. This way, the application program can read data contained in the table as it is being manipulated.</P>
<P class="docText">How does "dirty read" impact data availability and integrity? Consider the following sequence of events:</P>
<div style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">At 9:00 a.m., a transaction is executed containing the following SQL to change a specific value:</P><pre>

</pre><BR><pre>
UPDATE DSN8810.EMP
   SET FIRSTNME = "MICHELLE"
WHERE EMPNO = '010020';
</pre><BR><P class="docList">The transaction, which is a long-running one, continues to execute without issuing a <TT>COMMIT</TT>.</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">At 9:01 a.m., a second transaction attempts to <TT>SELECT</TT> the data that was changed but not committed.</P></div></LI></OL></div>
<P class="docText">If the <TT>UR</TT> isolation level were specified for the second transaction, it would read the changed data even though it had yet to be committed. Obviously, if the program does not wait to take a lock and merely reads the data in whatever state it happens to be at that moment, the program will execute faster than if it has to wait for locks to be taken and resources to be freed before processing.</P>
<P class="docText">However, you must carefully examine the implications of reading uncommitted data before implementing such a plan. Several types of "problems" can occur. A dirty read can cause duplicate rows to be returned where none exist. Also, a dirty read can cause no rows to be returned when one (or more) actually exists. Dirty reads might even cause rows to be returned out of order even when using an <TT>ORDER BY</TT>. Obviously, you must take these "problems" into consideration before using the <TT>UR</TT> isolation level.<A NAME="ch23index52"></A><A NAME="ch23index53"></A><A NAME="ch23index54"></A><A NAME="ch23index55"></A><A NAME="ch23index56"></A><A NAME="ch23index57"></A><A NAME="ch23index58"></A><A NAME="ch23index59"></A><A NAME="ch23index60"></A><A NAME="ch23index61"></A><A NAME="ch23index62"></A><A NAME="ch23index63"></A></P>
<A NAME="ch23lev4sec1"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title"><TT>ISOLATION(UR)</TT> Requirements</H5>
<P class="docText">The <TT>UR</TT> isolation level applies to read-only operations: <TT>SELECT</TT>, <TT>SELECT INTO</TT>, and <TT>FETCH</TT> from a read-only result table. Any application plan or package bound with an isolation level of <TT>UR</TT> uses uncommitted read functionality for read-only SQL. Operations that are contained in the same plan or package that are not read-only use an isolation level of <TT>CS</TT>.<A NAME="ch23index64"></A><A NAME="ch23index65"></A><A NAME="ch23index66"></A><A NAME="ch23index67"></A><A NAME="ch23index68"></A></P>
<P class="docText">You can override the isolation level that is defined at the plan or package level during <TT>BIND</TT> or <TT>REBIND</TT> as you want for each SQL statement in the program by using the <TT>WITH</TT> clause, as shown in the following SQL:</P>
<pre>

</pre><BR><pre>
SELECT EMPNO, FIRSTNME, LASTNAME
FROM   DSN8810.EMP
WITH UR;
</pre><BR>
<P class="docText">The <TT>WITH</TT> clause allows an isolation level to be specified at the statement level in an application program. However, the restriction that the <TT>UR</TT> isolation level can be used with read-only SQL statements only still applies.</P>
<A NAME="ch23note01"></A><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">CAUTION</p>

<P class="docText">If you are running on a pre-V6 DB2 subsystem, be aware that dirty read processing requires type-2 indexes. The <TT>UR</TT> isolation level is incompatible with type-1 indexes. If the plan or package is rebound to change to <TT>UR</TT> isolation, DB2 does not consider any access paths that use a type-1 index. If an acceptable type-2 index cannot be found, DB2 chooses a table space scan.</P></div><br>
<A NAME="ch23lev4sec2"></A><H5 class="docSection4Title">When to Use Dirty Reads</H5>
<P class="docText">When is using <TT>UR</TT> isolation appropriate? The general rule of thumb is to avoid <TT>UR</TT> whenever the results must be 100% accurate. Examples would be when<A NAME="ch23index69"></A><A NAME="ch23index70"></A><A NAME="ch23index71"></A><A NAME="ch23index72"></A><A NAME="ch23index73"></A></P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">Calculations that must balance are performed on the selected data</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Data is retrieved from one source to insert to or update another</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Production, mission-critical work that cannot contain or cause data-integrity problems is performed</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">In general, most current DB2 applications are not candidates for dirty reads. However, in a few specific situations, the dirty read capability is of major benefit. Consider the following cases in which the <TT>UR</TT> isolation level could prove to be useful:</P>
<UL><LI><P class="docList">Access is required to a reference, code, or lookup table that is basically static in nature. Due to the non-volatile nature of the data, a dirty read would be no different than a normal read the majority of the time. In the cases in which the code data is being modified, any application reading the data would incur minimum, if any, problems.<A NAME="ch23index74"></A><A NAME="ch23index75"></A><A NAME="ch23index76"></A><A NAME="ch23index77"></A><A NAME="ch23index78"></A></P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Statistical processing must be performed on a large amount of data. For example, your company may want to determine the average age of female employees within a certain pay range. The impact of an uncommitted read on an average of multiple rows is minimal because a single value changed usually does not have a significant impact on the result.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Dirty reads can prove invaluable in a DB2 data warehousing environment. A data warehouse is a time-sensitive, subject-oriented store of business data that is used for online analytical processing. Refer to <A class="docLink" HREF="ch45.html#ch45">Chapter 45</A>, "Data Warehousing with DB2," for more information on DB2 data warehouses. Other than periodic data propagation and/or replication, access to a data warehouse is read only. An uncommitted read is perfect in a read-only environment because it can cause little damage because the data is generally not changing. More and more data warehouse projects are being implemented in corporations worldwide, and DB2 with dirty read capability can be a wise choice for data warehouse implementation.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">In the rare cases in which a table, or set of tables, is used by a single user only, <TT>UR</TT> can make a lot of sense. If only one individual can modify the data, the application programs can be coded so that all (or most) reads are done using <TT>UR</TT> isolation level, and the data will still be accurate.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Dirty reads can be useful in pseudo-conversational transactions that use the save and compare technique. A program using the save and compare technique saves data for later comparison to ensure that the data was not changed by other concurrent transactions.</P><P class="docList">Consider the following sequence of events: transaction 1 changes customer A on page <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02lev1sec5.html#ch02lev4sec91">100</A>. A page lock will be taken on all rows on page <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02lev1sec5.html#ch02lev4sec91">100</A>. Transaction 2 requests customer C, which is on page <A class="docLink" HREF="ch02lev1sec5.html#ch02lev4sec91">100</A>. Transaction 2 must wait for transaction 1 to finish. This wait is not necessary. Even if these transactions are trying to get the same row, the save then compare technique would catch this.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Finally, if the data being accessed is already inconsistent, little harm can be done by using a dirty read to access the information.<A NAME="ch23index79"></A><A NAME="ch23index80"></A><A NAME="ch23index81"></A><A NAME="ch23index82"></A><A NAME="ch23index83"></A><A NAME="ch23index84"></A><A NAME="ch23index85"></A><A NAME="ch23index86"></A><A NAME="ch23index87"></A><A NAME="ch23index88"></A><A NAME="ch23index89"></A><A NAME="ch23index90"></A></P></LI></UL>
