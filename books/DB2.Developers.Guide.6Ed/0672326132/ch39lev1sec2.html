<P class="docText">There are a plethora of DB2 tool vendors offering many combinations of products from the categories we just reviewed. <A class="docLink" HREF="app03.html#app03">Appendix C</A>, "Valid DB2 Data Types" provides an up-to-date listing of the major DB2 ISVs.

<P class="docText">Although the most important aspect of DB2 tool selection is the functionality of the tool and the way it satisfies the needs of your organization, the nature and stability of the vendor that provides the product is important also. This section provides suggested questions to ask when you are selecting a DB2 tool vendor.<A NAME="ch39index214"></A><A NAME="ch39index215"></A></P>
<div style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">How long has the vendor been in business? How long has the vendor been supplying DB2 tools?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does your company have other tools from this vendor? How satisfied are the users of those tools?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Are other organizations satisfied with the tool you are selecting? Obtain a list of other organizations who use the same tool, and contact several of them.</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does the vendor provide a 24-hour support number? If not, what are its hours of operation? Does the vendor have a toll-free number? If not, how far away is the company from your site? You want to avoid accumulating long distance charges when you are requesting customer support from a vendor. (If an 800 number is not shown in the vendor list, that does not mean that the vendor does not have a toll-free customer support line.)</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does the vendor provide a newsletter? How technical is it? Does it provide information on DB2 and the vendor's tools, or just on the vendor's tools? Does the vendor provide a bulletin board service? Can you access it before establishing a relationship with the vendor to evaluate its usefulness? If so, scan some of the questions and reported problems for the tools before committing to the vendor's product.</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does this vendor supply other DB2 tools that your organization might need later? If so, are they functionally integrated with this one? Does the vendor supply a full suite of DB2 products or just a few?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does the vendor integrate its tools with other tools? For example, a product that analyzes databases to determine whether a <TT>REORG</TT> is required should integrate the <TT>REORG</TT> job with your shop's job scheduler.</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does the vendor provide training? Is it on-site training? Does the vendor supply DB2 training as well as training for its tools? Are installation, technical, and user manuals provided free of charge?—How many copies? Is mainframe- or PC-based training available for the vendor's tools?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Evaluate the response of the technical support number. Call the number with technical questions at least four times throughout the day: before 8:00 a.m., at noon, just before 5:00 p.m., and again after 9:00 p.m. These are the times when you could find problems with the level of support provided by the vendor. Was the phone busy? Were you put on hold? For how long? When you got a response, was it accurate and friendly? Did the person who answered the phone have to find someone with more technical knowledge? (This can indicate potential problems.)</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">How knowledgeable are the technical support representatives who answer your test calls? Do they know their products inside and out, or do they struggle with the products? Do they know DB2 well (such as a former DBA), or are they unseasoned?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Will the vendor answer DB2 questions free of charge in addition to questions about its product? Sometimes vendors will, but they do not advertise the fact. Try it out by calling the technical support number.</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does the vendor have a local office? If not, are technicians readily available for on-site error resolution if needed? At what price?<A NAME="ch39index216"></A><A NAME="ch39index217"></A></P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Will the vendor deliver additional documentation or error-resolution information by overnight mail? Does it publish a fax number?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">How are software fixes provided? Electronically? By tape? On the WWW? Is a complete reinstallation required? Are fixes typically accomplished using zaps?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">How many man hours, on a short notice, is the vendor willing to spend to solve problems? Is there a guaranteed time limit?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Is the vendor willing to send a sales representative to your site to do a presentation of the product tailored to your needs?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Is the vendor an IBM business partner? How soon will the vendor's tools be modified to support new DB2 releases and versions? Does the vendor participate in IBM's ESP (early ship program) for new DB2 versions and releases?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Have the vendor's tools been reviewed or highlighted in any industry publications recently? If so, obtain the publications and read the articles.</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Will the vendor assist in developing a cost justification? Most tool vendors are eager for your business and will be more than willing to provide cost justification to help you sell upper management on the need for the tool.</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does the vendor provide sample JCL to run its product? Skeleton JCL? A panel-driven JCL generator?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does the vendor charge an upgrade fee when the processor is upgraded? How flexible are the terms and conditions for the contract?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">If the vendor is sold or goes out of business, will the vendor supply the source code of the tool?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Is the vendor willing to set a ceiling for increases in the annual maintenance charge?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Does the vendor supply database administration tools for other DBMSs used at your shop? Can the same tool, using the same interface, be used to manage multiple databases across multiple operating systems?</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">How does the vendor rank enhancement requests?<A NAME="ch39index218"></A><A NAME="ch39index219"></A></P></div></LI></OL></div>
