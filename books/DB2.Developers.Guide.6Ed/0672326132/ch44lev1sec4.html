<P class="docText">The server views performance primarily in terms of throughput. Remember that throughput is the amount of work that can be done in a unit of time.</P>
<P class="docText">The requester views performance more in terms of response time. Response time is more visible to the end user. Recall that response time is the amount of time required to accomplish a predefined set of work.</P>

<P class="docText">The three biggest factors affecting throughput in a distributed environment are hardware, contention, and availability.</P>
<P class="docText">The processing speed of the <span class="docEmphasis">hardware</span> used in the distributed environment has a big impact on throughput. Factors such as processor speed (MIPS), available memory, physical configuration, and DASD speed have an impact on the throughput component of performance.<A NAME="ch44index115"></A><A NAME="ch44index116"></A></P>
<P class="docText">When the demand for a particular resource is high, <span class="docEmphasis">contention</span> results. When two or more processes attempt to utilize a particular resource in a conflicting manner, contention degrades overall performance. In a distributed environment, the number of locations that can utilize a resource increases; thus, contention problems usually increase.<A NAME="ch44index117"></A><A NAME="ch44index118"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The final factor is <span class="docEmphasis">availability.</span> In a distributed environment, multiple computing platforms are used. If one of these platforms breaks down or becomes otherwise unavailable (such as with a communication problem), throughput is affected. Depending on application design, throughput may<A NAME="ch44index119"></A><A NAME="ch44index120"></A></P>

<P class="docText">Follow standard DB2 performance tuning techniques, as outlined in <A class="docLink" HREF="part05.html#part05">Part V</A>, "DB2 Performance Tuning."</P>
<A NAME="ch44lev4sec11"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Minimize the SQL Result Set</H5>
<P class="docText">Be sure to access only the data that is actually required by the application. Do not access more data than is necessary and filter it out in the application program. Although this tip is a standard SQL tuning rule of thumb, it is particularly applicable in a distributed environment. When fewer rows qualify, less data is sent over the communication lines. And remember, network-related problems tend to be a significant obstacle in distributed environments.<A NAME="ch44index129"></A><A NAME="ch44index130"></A><A NAME="ch44index131"></A><A NAME="ch44index132"></A><A NAME="ch44index133"></A></P>

<P class="docText">Client programs can use the <TT>OPTIMIZE FOR </TT><span class="docEmphasis"><TT>n</TT></span> <TT>ROWS</TT> clause to optimize the retrieval of a large number of rows. To retrieve multiple query blocks on each network transmission, specify a large value for <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>n</TT></span>, in the <TT>OPTIMIZE FOR </TT><span class="docEmphasis"><TT>n</TT></span> <TT>ROWS</TT> clause for queries that must return a large number of rows.

<P class="docText">The buffer pool that will hold the distributed data, after it has been sent from the server to the client, is the buffer pool in which the CDB is defined.

<P class="docText">The general recommendation made in <A class="docLink" HREF="ch27.html#ch27">Chapter 27</A>, "Tuning DB2's Environment," (see <A class="docLink" HREF="ch27lev1sec1.html#ch27fig03">Figure 27.3</A>) is to code the dispatching priority of <TT>DSNDDF</TT> on a par with IMS MP regions (below short-running TSO requests but above medium-running TSO requests). However, in a distributed environment with critical distributed transactions, consider changing the dispatching priority of <TT>DSNDDF</TT> to a higher position in the hierarchy. Refer to <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch44fig06">Figure 44.6</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">You should set the dispatching priority of <TT>DSNDDF</TT> so that it is not so high as to affect overall system performance but not so low as to degrade the performance of distributed DB2 requests.</P>
<P class="docText">In general, higher dispatching priorities should be reserved for I/O-bound applications. Because <TT>DSNDDF</TT> is a low CPU consumer, setting a higher <TT>DPRTY</TT> may prove to be advantageous.</P>

<P class="docText">Ensure that a higher <TT>DSNDDF</TT> dispatching priority does not cause excessive resource consumption.

<A NAME="ch44lev4sec15"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title">Tuning VTAM Parameters</H5>
<P class="docText">Before you implement distributed DB2 applications, buy your VTAM systems programmer lunch! (Most system programmers have a ravenous appetite; buy them food, and they'll be your friends for life.)<A NAME="ch44index153"></A><A NAME="ch44index154"></A><A NAME="ch44index155"></A><A NAME="ch44index156"></A><A NAME="ch44index157"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The performance of DB2 in a distributed environment depends heavily on ensuring that the appropriate VTAM parameters are coded for the type of distributed applications to be implemented. The following VTAM parameters are important—pacing rate, VTAM delay, and conversation queuing:</P>
<P class="docText">If the VTAM <span class="docEmphasis">pacing rate</span> is set high, and your application retrieves multiple rows, the communication channels can become flooded, consuming an inordinate amount of system resources.</P>
<P class="docText">Avoid the VTAM <TT>DELAY</TT> parameter when your application is coded to retrieve single rows. The <TT>DELAY</TT> parameter causes a planned wait that would impede performance.<A NAME="ch44index158"></A><A NAME="ch44index159"></A></P>
<P class="docText">Queuing of conversations can greatly increase response time. Consider increasing <TT>CONVLIMIT</TT> if the number of queued conversations is high. Likewise, if the number of queued conversations is very low or zero, consider decreasing <TT>CONVLIMIT</TT>. Start the DB2 global trace, <TT>IFCID 167</TT>, to collect information on queued conversation requests.<A NAME="ch44index160"></A><A NAME="ch44index161"></A></P>
<P class="docText">The number of conversations that a remote DB2 subsystem can handle is controlled in the <TT>SYSIBM.LUMODES</TT> table. You use the <TT>CONVLIMIT</TT> column of <TT>LUMODES</TT> to set the limit of conversations per DB2 subsystem (in the <TT>LUNAME</TT> column) per VTAM logon mode (in the <TT>MODENAME</TT> column).</P>
<P class="docText">For a change to <TT>CONVLIMIT</TT> to take place, the DDF address space must be recycled. Whenever you're making these types of changes, be sure to keep your VTAM systems programmer in the loop, because setting these values overrides the VTAM <TT>DSESLIM</TT> parameter, and the VTAM systems programmer usually has a much better idea (than a DB2 DBA or analyst) of what these numbers should be.<A NAME="ch44index162"></A><A NAME="ch44index163"></A><A NAME="ch44index164"></A><A NAME="ch44index165"></A><A NAME="ch44index166"></A></P>
