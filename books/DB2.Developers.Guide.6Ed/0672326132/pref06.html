<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td valign="top"><A NAME="pref06"></A><H2 class="docPrefaceTitle">Introduction</H2><P class="docText">Welcome to the fifth edition of <span class="docEmphasis">DB2 Developer's Guide</span>. I have been overwhelmed by the success of the first four editions of this book. The information technology community obviously needs a practitioner's view of DB2 development issues and concerns. The second edition covered DB2 through V3; the third edition expanded that coverage to include DB2 V4 and V5; the fourth edition updated the text to cover DB2 V6; and this fifth edition brings the book up-to-date with the information about DB2 Versions 7 and 8. For an overview of the changes made to DB2 for V7 please refer to <A class="docLink" HREF="app06.html#app06">Appendix F</A>, while <A class="docLink" HREF="app07.html#app07">Appendix G</A> provides an introduction to DB2 V8.</P><P class="docText">Other books about DB2 are available, but most of them discuss the same tired subjects: SQL syntax, basic relational database design, normalization and embedded SQL programming with COBOL. <span class="docEmphasis">DB2 Developer's Guide</span>, 5E unlocks the secrets of DB2, picking up where the DB2 tutorial books leave off. It delves into subjects not covered adequately elsewhere—sometimes not even in IBM's DB2 manuals. This book clarifies complex DB2 topics, provides performance and procedural advice for implementing well-designed DB2 applications, and describes what DB2 does behind the scenes. Using <span class="docEmphasis">DB2 Developer's Guide</span>, 5E as a blueprint, your administration and development staff can implement optimized DB2 application systems.</P><P class="docText">This is not an introductory text on DB2 and SQL, but much of the advice contained herein is useful to the beginner as well as to the advanced user. It does not teach SQL syntax, relational theory, normalization, or logical database design, but it does provide suggestions on how and when to use these and other techniques. If you are interested in the intricacies of complex SQL instead of syntax diagrams, this book is for you. Other areas covered include</P><UL><LI><P class="docList">Comprehensive coverage of DB2 V8—the latest and greatest version of DB2.
