      <h3><a id="ch03lev1"></a><strong>3–1 Rounding Up/Down to a Multiple of a Known Power of 2</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">Rounding an unsigned integer <strong><em>x</em></strong> down to, for example, the next smaller multiple of 8 is trivial: <strong><em>x</em></strong> &amp; −<strong>8</strong> does it. An alternative is <span class="middle"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/059fig01.jpg" /></span>. These work for signed integers as well, provided “round down” means to round in
         the negative direction (e.g., (−<strong>37</strong>) &amp; (−<strong>8</strong>) = −<strong>40</strong>).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rounding up is almost as easy. For example, an unsigned integer <strong><em>x</em></strong> can be rounded up to the next greater multiple of 8 with either of

      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/059equ03.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">These expressions are correct for signed integers as well, provided “round up” means
         to round in the positive direction. The second term of the second expression is useful
         if you want to know how much you must add to <strong><em>x</em></strong> to make it a multiple of 8 [Gold].
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">To round a signed integer to the nearest multiple of 8 toward 0, you can combine the
         two expressions above in an obvious way:

      <p class="noindent">An alternative for the first line is <span class="middle"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/059fig02.jpg" /></span>, which is useful if the machine lacks <em>and immediate</em>, or if the constant is too large for its immediate field.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Sometimes the rounding factor is given as the log<sub>2</sub> of the alignment amount (e.g., a value of 3 means to round to a multiple of 8). In
         this case, code such as the following can be used, where <strong><em>k</em></strong> = log<sub>2</sub>(alignment amount):

      <p class="noindent">We define two functions that are similar to floor and ceiling, but which are directed
         roundings to the closest integral power of 2, rather than to the closest integer.
         Mathematically, they are defined by
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/060equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">The initial letters of the function names are intended to suggest “floor” and “ceiling.”
         Thus, flp2(<em>x</em>) is the greatest power of 2 that is <strong>≤</strong><em>x</em>, and clp2(<em>x</em>) is the least power of 2 that is <strong>≥</strong><em>x</em>. These definitions make sense even when <em>x</em> is not an integer (e.g., flp2(0.1) = 0.0625). The functions satisfy several relations
         analogous to those involving floor and ceiling, such as those shown below, where <em>n</em> is an integer.
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/060equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">Computationally, we deal only with the case in which <em>x</em> is an integer, and we take it to be unsigned, so the functions are well defined for
         all <strong><em>x</em></strong>. We require the value computed to be the arithmetically correct value modulo 2<sup>32</sup> (that is, we take clp2(<strong><em>x</em></strong>) to be <strong>0</strong> for <strong><em>x</em></strong> &gt; <strong>2<sup>31</sup></strong>). The functions are tabulated below for a few values of <strong><em>x</em></strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="indent"><a id="page_61"></a>Functions flp2 and clp2 are connected by the relations shown below. These can be used
         to compute one from the other, subject to the indicated restrictions.
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/061equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">The round-up and round-down functions can be computed quite easily with the <em>number of leading zeros</em> instruction, as shown below. However, for these relations to hold for <strong><em>x</em></strong> = <strong>0</strong> and <strong><em>x</em></strong> &gt; <strong>2<sup>31</sup></strong>, the computer must have its shift instructions defined to produce <strong>0</strong> for shift amounts of –1, 32, and 63. Many machines (e.g., PowerPC) have “mod-64”
         shifts, which do this. In the case of −1, it is adequate if the machine shifts in
         the opposite direction (that is, a shift left of –1 becomes a shift right of 1).

      <h3><a id="page_63"></a><a id="ch03lev3"></a><strong>3–3 Detecting a Power-of-2 Boundary Crossing</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">Assume memory is divided into blocks that are a power of 2 in size, starting at address
         0. The blocks may be words, doublewords, pages, and so on. Then, given a starting
         address <em>a</em> and a length <em>l</em>, we wish to determine whether or not the address range from <em>a</em> to <em>a</em> + <em>l</em> –1, <em>l</em> ≥ 2, crosses a block boundary. The quantities <em>a</em> and <em>l</em> are unsigned and any values that fit in a register are possible.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If <em>l</em> = 0 or 1, a boundary crossing does not occur, regardless of <em>a</em>. If <em>l</em> exceeds the block size, a boundary crossing does occur, regardless of <em>a</em>. For very large values of <em>l</em> (wraparound is possible), a boundary crossing can occur even if the first and last
         bytes of the address range are in the same block.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">There is a surprisingly concise way to detect boundary crossings on the IBM System/370
         [CJS]. This method is illustrated below for a block size of 4096 bytes (a common page
         size).
      </p>

      <p class="programlisting3">O   RA,=A(-4096)<br />ALR RA,RL<br />BO  CROSSES
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">The first instruction forms the logical <em>or</em> of RA (which contains the starting address <em>a</em>) and the number 0xFFFFF000. The second instruction adds in the length and sets the
         machine’s 2-bit condition code. For the <em>add logical</em> instruction, the first bit of the condition code is set to 1 if a carry occurred,
         and the second bit is set to 1 if the 32-bit register result is nonzero. The last
         instruction branches if both bits are set. At the branch target, RA will contain the
         length that extends beyond the first page (this is an extra feature that was not asked
         for).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If, for example, <em>a</em> = 0 and <em>l</em> = 4096, a carry occurs, but the register result is 0, so the program properly does
         <em>not</em> branch to label CROSSES.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Let us see how this method can be adapted to RISC machines, which generally do not
         have <em>branch on carry and register result nonzero</em>. Using a block size of 8 for notational simplicity, the method of [CJS] branches
         to CROSSES if a carry occurred ((<em>a</em> | –8) + <em>l</em>≥ 2<sup>32</sup>) and the register result is nonzero ((<em>a</em> | –8) + <em>l</em> ≠ 2<sup>32</sup>). Thus, it is equivalent to the predicate
      </p>
      
      <p class="center">(<em>a</em> | –8) + <em>l</em> &gt; 2<sup>32</sup>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">This in turn is equivalent to getting a carry in the final addition in evaluating
         ((<em>a</em> | –8) – 1) + <em>l</em>. If the machine has <em>branch on carry</em>, this can be used directly, giving a solution in about five instructions, counting
         a load of the constant −8.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If the machine does not have <em>branch on carry</em>, we can use the fact that carry occurs in <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> iff <span class="middle"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/063fig01.jpg" /></span> (see “<a href="ch02.html#page_31">Unsigned Add/Subtract</a>” on page <a href="ch02.html#page_31">31</a>) to obtain the expression

      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/063equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_64"></a>Using various identities such as ¬(<strong><em>x</em></strong> − <strong>1</strong>) = −<strong><em>x</em></strong> gives the following equivalent expressions for the “boundary crossed” predicate:

      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/064equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">These can be evaluated in five or six instructions on most RISC computers, counting
         the final conditional branch.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Using another tack, clearly an 8-byte boundary is crossed iff</p>
      
      <p class="center">(<em>a</em> &amp; 7) + <em>l</em> − 1 ≥ 8.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">This cannot be directly evaluated because of the possibility of overflow (which occurs
         if <em>l</em> is very large), but it is easily rearranged to 8 − (<em>a</em> &amp; 7) &lt; <strong><em>l</em></strong>, which can be directly evaluated on the computer (no part of it overflows). This
         gives the expression
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/064equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">which can be evaluated in five instructions on most RISCs (four if it has <em>subtract from immediate</em>). If a boundary crossing occurs, the length that extends beyond the first block is
         given by <strong><em>l</em></strong> − (<strong>8</strong> − (<strong><em>a</em></strong> &amp; <strong>7</strong>)), which can be calculated with one additional instruction (<em>subtract</em>).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">This formula can be easily understood from the figure below [Kumar], which illustrates
         that <strong><em>a</em></strong> &amp; <strong>7</strong> is the offset of <strong><em>a</em></strong> in its block, and thus <strong>8</strong> − (<strong><em>a</em></strong> &amp; 7) is the space remaining in the block.
