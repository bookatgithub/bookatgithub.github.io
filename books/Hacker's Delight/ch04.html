      <h3><a id="ch04lev1"></a><strong>4–1 Checking Bounds of Integers</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">By “bounds checking” we mean to verify that an integer <em>x</em> is within two bounds <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>—that is, that
      </p>
      
      <p class="center"><em>a</em> ≤ <em>x</em> ≤ <em>b</em>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">We first assume that all quantities are signed integers.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">An important application is the checking of array indexes. For example, suppose a
         one-dimensional array <em>A</em> can be indexed by values from 1 to 10. Then, for a reference <em>A</em>(<em>i</em>), a compiler might generate code to check that
      </p>
      
      <p class="center">1 ≤ <em>i</em> ≤ 10
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">and to <em>branch</em> or <em>trap</em> if this is not the case. In this section we show that this check can be done with
         a single comparison, by performing the equivalent check [PL8]:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/067equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">This is probably better code, because it involves only one <em>compare-branch</em> (or <em>compare-trap</em>), and because the quantity <em>i</em>– 1 is probably needed anyway for the array addressing calculations.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Does the implementation</p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/067equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">always work, even if overflow may occur in the subtractions? It does, provided we
         somehow know that <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em>. In the case of array bounds checking, language rules may require that an array not
         have a number of elements (or number of elements along any axis) that are 0 or negative,
         and this rule can be verified at compile time or, for dynamic extents, at array allocation
         time. In such an environment, the transformation above is correct, as we will now
         show.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">It is convenient to use a lemma, which is good to know in its own right.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">L<small>EMMA</small>. <em>If a and b are signed integers and a</em> ≤ <em>b, then the computed value</em> <strong><em>b</em></strong> – <strong><em>a</em></strong> <em>correctly represents the arithmetic value b</em> − <em>a, if the computed value is interpreted as unsigned</em>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Proof</em>. (Assume a 32-bit machine.) Because <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em>, the true difference <em>b</em> − <em>a</em> is in the range 0 to (2<sup>31</sup> − 1) − (−2<sup>31</sup>) = 2<sup>32</sup> − 1. If the true difference is in the <a id="page_68"></a>range 0 to 2<sup>31</sup> − 1, then the machine result is correct (because the result is representable under
         signed interpretation), and the sign bit is off. Hence the machine result is correct
         under either signed or unsigned interpretation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If the true difference is in the range 2<sup>31</sup> to 2<sup>32</sup> − 1, then the machine result will differ by some multiple of 2<sup>32</sup> (because the result is not representable under signed interpretation). This brings
         the result (under signed interpretation) to the range −2<sup>31</sup> to −1. The machine result is too low by 2<sup>32</sup>, and the sign bit is on. Reinterpreting the result as unsigned increases it by 2<sup>32</sup>, because the sign bit is given a weight of + 2<sup>31</sup> rather than −2<sup>31</sup>. Hence the reinterpreted result is correct.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The “bounds theorem” is</p>

      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/04equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Proof</em>. We distinguish three cases, based on the value of <em>x</em>. In all cases, by the lemma, since <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em>, the computed value <strong><em>b</em></strong> – <strong><em>a</em></strong> is equal to the arithmetic value <em>b</em> – <em>a</em> if <strong><em>b</em></strong> – <strong><em>a</em></strong> is interpreted as unsigned, as it is in Equation (1).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Case 1, <em>x</em> &lt; <em>a</em>: In this case, <strong><em>x</em></strong> – <strong><em>a</em></strong> interpreted as unsigned is <em>x</em>– <em>a</em> + 2<sup>32</sup>. Whatever the values of <em>x</em> and <em>b</em> are (within the range of 32-bit numbers),

Hence

      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/068equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">that is, both sides of Equation (1) are <strong>true</strong>.

      <p class="indent">Case 3, <em>x</em> &gt; <em>b</em>: Then <em>x</em> − <em>a</em> &gt; <em>b</em> − <em>a</em>. Because in this case <em>x</em> &gt; <em>a</em> (because <em>b</em> ≥ <em>a</em>), by the lemma <em>x</em> − <em>a</em> equals the value of <strong><em>x</em></strong> − <strong><em>a</em></strong> if the latter is interpreted as unsigned.

      <p class="indent"><a id="page_69"></a>The theorem stated above is also true if <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are <em>unsigned</em> integers. This is because for unsigned integers the lemma holds trivially, and the
         above proof is also valid.

      <p class="indent">Below is a list of similar bounds-checking transformations, with the theorem above

      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">There are some quite different transformations that may be useful when the test is
         of the form –2<sup><em>n</em>–1</sup> ≤ <em>x</em> ≤ 2<sup><em>n</em>–1</sup> – 1. This is a test to see if a signed quantity <em>x</em> can be correctly represented as an <em>n</em>-bit two’s-complement integer. To illustrate with <em>n</em> = 8, the following tests are equivalent:

      <p class="noindent">Equation (b) is simply an application of the preceding material in this section. Equation
         (c) is as well, after shifting <strong><em>x</em></strong> right seven positions. Equations (c) – (f) and possibly (g) are probably useful only
         if the constants in Equations (a) and (b) exceed the size of the immediate fields
         of the computer’s <em>compare</em> and <em>add</em> instructions.

      <p class="noindent">Some optimizing compilers perform “range analysis” of expressions. This is the process
         of determining, for each occurrence of an expression in a program, upper and lower
         bounds on its value. Although this optimization is not a really big winner, it does
         permit improvements such as omitting the range check on a C “switch” statement and
         omitting some subscript bounds checks that compilers may provide as a debugging aid.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Suppose we have bounds on two variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> as follows, where all quantities are unsigned:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/04equ03.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">Then, how can we compute tight bounds on <strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>y, x</em></strong> – <strong><em>y</em></strong>, and – <strong><em>x</em></strong>? Arithmetically, of course, <em>a</em> + <em>c</em> ≤ <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> ≤ <em>b</em> + <em>d</em>; but the point is that the additions may overflow.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The way to calculate the bounds is expressed in the following:</p>
      
      <p class="indent">T<small>HEOREM</small>. <em>If a, b, c, d, x, and y are unsigned integers and</em></p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/070equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>then</em></p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/04equ04.jpg" /></div>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/04equ05.jpg" /></div>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/04equ06.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">Inequalities (4) say that the bounds on <strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>y</em></strong> are “normally” <strong><em>a</em></strong> + <strong><em>c</em></strong> and <strong><em>b</em></strong> + <strong><em>d</em></strong>, but if the calculation of <strong><em>a</em></strong> + <strong><em>c</em></strong> does <em>not</em> overflow and the calculation of <strong><em>b</em></strong> + <strong><em>d</em></strong> <em>does</em> overflow, then the bounds are 0 and the maximum unsigned integer. Equations (5) are
         interpreted similarly, but the true result of a subtraction being less than 0 constitutes
         an overflow (in the negative direction).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_71"></a><em>Proof</em>. If neither <strong><em>a</em></strong> + <strong><em>c</em></strong> nor <strong><em>b</em></strong> + <strong><em>d</em></strong> overflows, then <strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>y</em></strong>, with <strong><em>x</em></strong> and <strong><em>y</em></strong> in the indicated ranges, cannot overflow, making the computed results equal to the
         true results, so the second inequality of (4) holds. If both <strong><em>a</em></strong> + <strong><em>c</em></strong> and <strong><em>b</em></strong> + <strong><em>d</em></strong> overflow, then so also does <strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>y</em></strong>. Now arithmetically, it is clear that
      </p>
      
      <p class="center"><em>a</em> + <em>c</em>−2<sup>32</sup> ≤ <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> −2<sup>32</sup> ≤ <em>b</em> + <em>d</em> − 2<sup>32</sup>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">This is what is calculated when the three terms overflow. Hence, in this case also,</p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/071equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">If <strong><em>a</em></strong> + <strong><em>c</em></strong> does not overflow, but <strong><em>b</em></strong> + <strong><em>d</em></strong> does, then
      </p>
      
      <p class="center"><em>a</em> + <em>c</em> ≤ 2<sup>32</sup> − 1 and <em>b</em> + <em>d</em> ≥ 2<sup>32</sup>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">Because <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> takes on all values in the range <em>a</em> + <em>c</em> to <em>b</em> + <em>d</em>, it takes on the values 2<sup>32</sup> − 1 and 2<sup>32</sup>—that is, the computed value <strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>y</em></strong> takes on the values 2<sup>32</sup> − 1 and 0 (although it doesn’t take on <em>all</em> values in that range).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Lastly, the case that <strong><em>a</em></strong> + <strong><em>c</em></strong> overflows, but <strong><em>b</em></strong> + <strong><em>d</em></strong> does not, cannot occur, because <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> ≤ <em>d</em>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">This completes the proof of inequalities (4). The proof of (5) is similar, but “overflow”
         means that a true difference is less than 0.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Inequalities (6) can be proved by using (5) with <em>a</em> = <em>b</em> = 0, and then renaming the variables. (The expression – <strong><em>x</em></strong> with <strong><em>x</em></strong> an unsigned number means to compute the value of 2<sup>32</sup> − <em>x</em>, or of ¬<strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong>1</strong> if you prefer.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Because unsigned overflow is so easy to recognize (see “<a href="ch02.html#page_31">Unsigned Add/Subtract</a>” on page <a href="ch02.html#page_31">31</a>), these results are easily embodied in code, as shown in <a href="ch04.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4–1</a>, for addition and subtraction. The computed lower and upper limits are variables
         <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, respectively.

      <h4><strong>Signed Numbers</strong></h4>
      
      <p class="noindent">The case of signed numbers is not so clean. As before, suppose we have bounds on two
         variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> as follows, where all quantities are <em>signed</em>:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/071equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent"><a id="page_72"></a>We wish to compute tight bounds on <strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>y, x</em></strong> − <strong><em>y</em></strong>, and – <strong><em>x</em></strong>. The reasoning is very similar to that for the case of unsigned numbers, and the
         results for addition are shown below.
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/04equ07.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">The first row means that if both of the additions <em>a</em> + <em>c</em> and <em>b</em> + <em>d</em> overflow in the negative direction, then the computed sum <strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>y</em></strong> lies between the computed sums <strong><em>a</em></strong> + <strong><em>c</em></strong> and <strong><em>b</em></strong> + <strong><em>d</em></strong>. This is because all three computed sums are too high by the same amount (2<sup>32</sup>). The second row means that if the addition <em>a</em> + <em>c</em> overflows in the negative direction, and the addition <em>b</em> + <em>d</em> either does not overflow or overflows in the positive direction, then the computed
         sum <strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>y</em></strong> can take on the extreme negative number and the extreme positive number (although
         perhaps not all values in between), which is not difficult to show. The other rows
         are interpreted similarly.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The rules for propagating bounds on signed numbers through the subtraction operation
         can easily be derived by rewriting the bounds on <em>y</em> as
      </p>
      
      <p class="center">− <em>d</em> ≤ – <em>y</em> ≤ – <em>c</em></p>
      
      <p class="noindent">and using the rules for addition. The results are shown below.</p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/072equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">The rules for negation can be derived from the rules for subtraction by taking <em>a</em> = <em>b</em> = 0, omitting some impossible combinations, simplifying, and renaming. The results
         are as follows:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/072equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">C code for the case of signed numbers is a bit messy. We will consider only addition.
         It seems to be simplest to check for the two cases in (7) in which the computed limits
         are the extreme negative and positive numbers. Overflow in the <a id="page_73"></a>negative direction occurs if the two operands are negative and the sum is nonnegative
         (see “<a href="ch02.html#ch02lev">Signed Add/Subtract</a>” on page <a href="ch02.html#page_28">28</a>). Thus, to check for the condition that <em>a</em> + <em>c</em> &lt; –2<sup>31</sup>, we could let <code>s = a + c;</code> and then code something like “<code>if (a &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; s &gt;= 0)</code> ....” It will be more efficient,<sup><a id="ch04fna1"></a><a href="footnotes.html#ch04fn1">1</a></sup> however, to perform logical operations directly on the arithmetic variables, with
         the sign bit containing the true/false result of the logical operations. Then, we
         write the above condition as “<code>if ((a &amp; c &amp; ~s) &lt; 0)</code> ....” These considerations lead to the program fragment shown in <a href="ch04.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4–2</a>.

Thus, the lower bound is not max(<strong><em>a, c</em></strong>), nor is it <strong><em>a</em></strong> | <strong><em>c</em></strong>, and the upper bound is not <strong><em>b</em></strong> + <strong><em>d</em></strong>, nor is it <strong><em>b</em></strong> | <strong><em>d</em></strong>.

      <p class="indent">Given the values of <em>a, b, c</em>, and <em>d</em> in inequalities (8), how can one obtain tight bounds on the logical expressions?
         Consider first the minimum value attained by <strong><em>x</em></strong> | <strong><em>y</em></strong>. A reasonable guess might be the value of this expression with <strong><em>x</em></strong> and <strong><em>y</em></strong> both at their minima—that is, <strong><em>a</em></strong> | <strong><em>c</em></strong>. Example (9), however, shows that the minimum can be lower than this.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">To find the minimum, our procedure is to start with <strong><em>x</em></strong> = <strong><em>a</em></strong> and <strong><em>y</em></strong> = <strong><em>c</em></strong>, and then find an amount by which to increase either <strong><em>x</em></strong> or <strong><em>y</em></strong> so as to reduce the value of <strong><em>x</em></strong> | <strong><em>y</em></strong>. The result will be this reduced value. Rather than assigning <strong><em>a</em></strong> and <strong><em>c</em></strong> to <strong><em>x</em></strong> and <strong><em>y</em></strong>, we work directly with <strong><em>a</em></strong> and <strong><em>c</em></strong>, increasing one of them when doing so is valid and it reduces the value of <strong><em>a</em></strong> | <strong><em>c</em></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The procedure is to scan the bits of <strong><em>a</em></strong> and <strong><em>c</em></strong> from left to right. If both bits are 0, the result will have a 0 in that position.
         If both bits are 1, the result will have a 1 in that position (clearly, no values
         of <strong><em>x</em></strong> and <strong><em>y</em></strong> could make the result less). In these cases, continue the scan to the next bit position.
         If one scanned bit is 1 and the other is 0, then it is possible that changing the
         0 to 1 and setting all the following bits in that bound’s value to 0 will reduce the
         value of <strong><em>a</em></strong> | <strong><em>c</em></strong>. This change will not increase the value of <strong><em>a</em></strong> | <strong><em>c</em></strong>, because the result has a 1 in that position anyway, from the other bound. Therefore,
         form the number with the 0 changed to 1 and subsequent bits changed to 0. If that
         is less than or equal to the corresponding upper limit, the change can be made; do
         it, and the result is the <em>or</em> of the modified value with the other lower bound. If the change cannot be made (because
         the altered value exceeds the corresponding upper bound), continue the scan to the
         next bit position.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">That’s all there is to it. It might seem that after making the change the scan should
         continue, looking for other opportunities to further reduce the value of <strong><em>a</em></strong> | <strong><em>c</em></strong>. However, even if a position is found that allows a 0 to be changed to 1, setting
         the subsequent bits to 0 does not reduce the value of <strong><em>a</em></strong> | <strong><em>c</em></strong>, because those bits are already 0.

      <p class="noindent">This skips over initial bit positions in which <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> are both 0 or both 1. For this speedup to be effective when <code>a ^ c</code> is 0 (that is, when <code>a</code> = <code>c</code>), the machine’s <em>shift right</em> instruction should be mod-64. If <em>number of leading zeros</em> is not available, it may be worthwhile to use some version of the flp2 function (see
         page <a href="ch03.html#page_60">60</a>) with argument <code>a</code> ^ <code>c</code>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Now let us consider the <em>maximum</em> value attained by <strong><em>x</em></strong> <em>|</em><strong><em>y</em></strong>, with the variables bounded as shown in inequalities (8). The algorithm is similar
         to that for the minimum, except it scans the values of bounds <em>b</em> and <em>d</em> (from left to right), looking for a position in which both bits are 1. If such a
         position is found, the algorithm tries to increase the value of <strong><em>c</em></strong> <em>|</em> <strong><em>d</em></strong> by decreasing one of the bounds by changing the 1 to 0, and setting all subsequent
         bits in that bound to 1. If this is acceptable (if the resulting value is greater
         than or equal to the corresponding lower bound), the change is made and the result
         is the value of <strong><em>c</em></strong> <em>|</em> <strong><em>d</em></strong> using the modified bound. If the change cannot be done, it is attempted on the other
         bound. If the change cannot be done to either bound, the scan continues. C code for
         this algorithm is shown in <a href="ch04.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4–4</a>. Here the subexpression <code>b</code> &amp; <code>d</code> can be moved out of the loop, and the algorithm can be speeded up by initializing

      <h4><strong>Signed Bounds</strong></h4>
      
      <p class="noindent">If the bounds are <em>signed</em> integers, propagating them through logical expressions is substantially more complicated.
         The calculation is irregular if 0 is within the range <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>, or <em>c</em> to <em>d</em>. One way to calculate the lower and upper bounds for the expression <strong><em>x</em></strong> | <strong><em>y</em></strong> is shown in <a href="ch04.html#ch04tab1">Table 4–1</a>. A “+” entry means that the bound at the top of the column is greater than or equal
         to 0, and a “–” entry means that it is less than 0. The column labeled “minOR (signed)”
         contains expressions for computing the lower bound of <strong><em>x</em></strong> | <strong><em>y</em></strong>, and the last column contains expressions for computing the upper bound of <strong><em>x</em></strong> | <strong><em>y</em></strong>. One way to program this is to construct a value ranging from 0 to 15 from the sign
         bits of <strong><em>a, b, c</em></strong>, and <strong><em>d</em></strong>, and use a “switch” statement. Notice that not all values from 0 to 15 are used,
         because it is impossible to have <strong><em>a</em></strong> &gt; <strong><em>b</em></strong> or <strong><em>c</em></strong> &gt; <strong><em>d</em></strong>.
