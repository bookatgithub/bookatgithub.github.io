      <h3><a id="ch08lev1"></a><strong>8–1 Multiword Multiplication</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">This can be done with, basically, the traditional grade-school method. But rather
         than develop an array of partial products, it is more efficient to add each new row,
         as it is being computed, into a row that will become the product.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If the multiplicand is <em>m</em> words, and the multiplier is <em>n</em> words, then the product occupies <em>m</em> + <em>n</em> words (or fewer), whether signed or unsigned.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In applying the grade-school scheme, we would like to treat each 32-bit word as a
         single digit. This works out well if an instruction that gives the 64-bit product
         of two 32-bit integers is available. Unfortunately, even if the machine has such an
         instruction, it is not readily accessible from most high-level languages. In fact,
         many modern RISC machines do not have this instruction in part <em>because</em> it isn’t accessible from high-level languages and thus would not be used often. (Another
         reason is that the instruction would be one of a very few that give a two-register
         result.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Our procedure is shown in <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a>. It uses halfwords as the “digits.” Parameter <code>w</code> gets the result, and <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> are the multiplier and multiplicand, respectively. Each is an array of halfwords,
         with the first halfword (<code>w[0]</code>, <code>u[0],</code> and <code>v[0]</code>) being the least significant digit. This is “little-endian” order. Parameters <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the number of halfwords in <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>, respectively.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The picture below may help in understanding. There is no relation between <code>m</code> and <code>n</code>; either may be the larger.
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/171equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">The procedure follows Algorithm M of [Knu2, 4.3.1] but is coded in C and modified
         to perform signed multiplication. Observe that the assignment to <code>t</code> in the upper half of <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a> cannot overflow, because the maximum value that could be assigned to <code>t</code> is (2<sup>16</sup> – 1)<sup>2</sup> + 2(2<sup>16</sup> – 1) = 2<sup>32</sup> – 1.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Multiword multiplication is simplest for unsigned operands. In fact, the code of <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a> performs unsigned multiplication if the “correction” steps (the lines between the
         three-line comment and the “return” statement) are omitted. An unsigned version can
         be extended to signed in three ways:
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingN">1. Take the absolute value of each input operand, perform unsigned multiplication,
         and then negate the result if the input operands had different signs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingN"><a id="page_172"></a>2. Perform the multiplication using unsigned elementary multiplication, except when
         multiplying one of the high-order halfwords, in which case use signed × unsigned or
         signed × signed multiplication.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingN">3. Perform unsigned multiplication and then correct the result somehow.</p>

      <p class="fig-caption">F<small>IGURE</small> 8–1. Multiword integer multiplication, signed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_173"></a>The first method requires passing over as many as <em>m</em> + <em>n</em> input halfwords to compute their absolute value. Or, if one operand is positive and
         one is negative, the method requires passing over as many as max(<em>m, n</em>) + <em>m</em> + <em>n</em> halfwords to complement the negative input operand and the result. Perhaps more serious,
         the algorithm would alter its inputs (which we assume are passed by address), which
         may be unacceptable in some applications. Alternatively, it could allocate temporary
         space for them, or it could alter them and later change them back. All these alternatives
         are unappealing.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The second method requires three kinds of elementary multiplication (unsigned × unsigned,
         unsigned × signed, and signed × signed) and requires sign extension of partial products
         on the left, with 0’s or 1’s, making each partial product take longer to compute and
         add to the running total.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">We choose the third method. To see how it works, let <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> denote the values of the two signed integers being multiplied, and let them be of
         lengths <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> bits, respectively. Then the steps in the upper half of <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a> erroneously interpret <em>u</em> as an unsigned quantity, having value <em>u</em> + 2<em><sup>M</sup>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub>, where <em>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub> is the sign bit of <em>u</em>. That is, <em>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub> = 1 if <em>u</em> is negative, and <em>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub> = 0 otherwise. Similarly, the program interprets <em>v</em> as having value <em>v</em> + 2<em><sup>N</sup>u</em><sub><em>N</em> – 1</sub>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The program computes the product of these unsigned numbers—that is, it computes</p>
      
      <p class="center">(<em>u</em> + 2<em><sup>M</sup>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub>)(<em>v</em> + 2<em><sup>N</sup>v</em><sub><em>N</em> – 1</sub>) = <em>uv</em> + 2<em><sup>M</sup>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub><em>v</em> + 2<em><sup>N</sup>v</em><sub><em>N</em> – 1</sub><em>u</em> + 2<em><sup>M + N</sup>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub><em>v</em><sub><em>N</em> – 1</sub>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">To get the desired result (<em>uv</em>), we must subtract from the unsigned product the value 2<em><sup>M</sup>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub><em>v</em> + 2<em><sup>N</sup>v</em><sub><em>N</em> – 1</sub><em>u</em>. There is no need to subtract the term 2<em><sup>M + N</sup>u</em><sub><em>M</em> – 1</sub><em>v</em><sub><em>N</em> – 1</sub>, because we know that the result can be expressed in <em>M</em> + <em>N</em> bits, so there is no need to compute any product bits more significant than bit position
         <em>M</em> + <em>N</em> – 1. These two subtractions are performed by the steps below the three-line comment
         in <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a>. They require passing over a maximum of <em>m</em> + <em>n</em> halfwords.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">It might be tempting to use the program of <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a> by passing it an array of fullword integers—that is, by “lying across the interface.”
         Such a program will work on a little-endian machine, but not on a big-endian one.
         If we had stored the arrays in the reverse order, with <code>u[0]</code> being the most significant halfword (and the program altered accordingly), the “lying”
         program would work on a big-endian machine, but not on a little-endian one.
      </p>
      
      <h3><a id="ch08lev2"></a><strong>8–2 High-Order Half of 64-Bit Product</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">Here we consider the problem of computing the high-order 32 bits of the product of
         two 32-bit integers. This is the function of our basic RISC instructions <em>multiply high signed</em> (<code>mulhs</code>) and <em>multiply high unsigned</em> (<code>mulhu</code>).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">For unsigned multiplication, the algorithm in the upper half of <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a> works well. Rewrite it for the special case <em>m</em> = <em>n</em> = 2, with loops unrolled, obvious simplifications made, and the parameters changed
         to 32-bit unsigned integers.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_174"></a>For signed multiplication, it is not necessary to code the “correction steps” in the
         lower half of <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a>. These can be omitted if proper attention is paid to whether the intermediate results
         are signed or unsigned (declaring them to be signed causes the right shifts to be
         sign-propagating shifts). The resulting algorithm is shown in <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig2">Figure 8–2</a>. For an unsigned version, simply change all the <code>int</code> declarations to <code>unsigned.</code></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The algorithm requires 16 basic RISC instructions in either the signed or unsigned
         version, four of which are multiplications.

      <h3><a id="ch08lev3"></a><strong>8–3 High-Order Product Signed from/to Unsigned</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">Assume that the machine can readily compute the high-order half of the 64-bit product
         of two <em>unsigned</em> 32-bit integers, but we wish to perform the corresponding operation on <em>signed</em> integers. We could use the procedure of <a href="ch08.html#ch08fig2">Figure 8–2</a>, but that requires four multiplications; the procedure to be given [BGN] is much
         more efficient than that.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The analysis is a special case of that done to convert Knuth’s Algorithm M from an
         unsigned to a signed multiplication routine (<a href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8–1</a>). Let <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> denote the two 32-bit signed integers that we wish to multiply together. The machine
         will interpret <em>x</em> as an <em>unsigned</em> integer, having the value <em>x</em> + 2<sup>32</sup><em>x</em><sub>31</sub>, where <em>x</em><sub>31</sub> is the most significant bit of <em>x</em> (that is, x<sub>31</sub> is the integer 1 if <em>x</em> is negative, and 0 otherwise). Similarly, <em>y</em> under unsigned interpretation has the value <em>y</em> + 2<sup>32</sup><em>y</em><sub>31</sub>.

      <p class="center">(<em>x</em> + 2<sup>32</sup><em>x</em><sub>31</sub>)(<em>y</em> + 2<sup>32</sup><em>y</em><sub>31</sub>) = <em>xy</em> + 2<sup>32</sup>(<em>x</em><sub>31</sub> <em>y</em> + <em>y</em><sub>31</sub><em>x</em>) + 2<sup>64</sup><em>x</em><sub>31</sub><em>y</em><sub>31</sub>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">To get the desired result, we must subtract from this the quantity 2<sup>32</sup>(<em>x</em><sub>31</sub><em>y</em> + <em>y</em><sub>31</sub><em>x</em>) + 2<sup>64</sup><em>x</em><sub>31</sub><em>y</em><sub>31</sub>. Because we know that the result can be expressed in 64 bits, <a id="page_175"></a>we can perform the arithmetic modulo 2<sup>64</sup>. This means that we can safely ignore the last term, and compute the signed high-order
         product as shown below (seven basic RISC instructions).

      <h4><strong>Unsigned from Signed</strong></h4>
      
      <p class="noindent">The reverse transformation follows easily. The resulting program is the same as (1),
         except with the first instruction changed to <em>multiply high signed</em> and the last operation changed to <strong><em>p</em> ← <em>p</em></strong> + <strong><em>t</em></strong><sub>1</sub> + <strong><em>t</em></strong><sub>2</sub>.
      </p>
      
      <h3><a id="ch08lev4"></a><strong>8–4 Multiplication by Constants</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">It is nearly a triviality that one can multiply by a constant with a sequence of <em>shift left</em> and <em>add</em> instructions. For example, to multiply <strong><em>x</em></strong> by 13 (binary 1101), one can code
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/175equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">where <strong><em>r</em></strong> gets the result.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In this section, left shifts are denoted by multiplication by a power of 2, so the
         above plan is written <strong><em>r</em> ← 8<em>x</em></strong> + 4<strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>x</em></strong>, which is intended to show four instructions on the basic RISC and most machines.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">What we want to convey here is that there is more to this subject than meets the eye.
         First of all, there are other considerations besides simply the number of <em>shift</em>’s and <em>add</em>’s required to do a multiplication by a given constant. To illustrate, below are two
         plans for multiplying by 45 (binary 101101).
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/175equ03.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_176"></a>The plan on the left uses a variable <strong><em>t</em></strong> that holds <strong><em>x</em></strong> shifted left by a number of positions that corresponds to a 1-bit in the multiplier.
         Each shifted value is obtained from the one before it. This plan has these advantages:
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingB">• It requires only one working register other than the input <strong><em>x</em></strong> and the output <strong><em>r</em></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingB">• Except for the first two, it uses only 2-address instructions.</p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingB">• The shift amounts are relatively small.</p>
      
      <p class="noindent">The same properties are retained when the plan is applied to any multiplier.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The scheme on the right does all the <em>shift</em>’s first, with <strong><em>x</em></strong> as the operand. It has the advantage of increased parallelism. On a machine with
         sufficient instruction-level parallelism, the scheme on the right executes in three
         cycles, whereas the scheme on the left, running on a machine with unlimited parallelism,
         requires four.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In addition to these details, it is nontrivial to find the minimum number of operations
         to accomplish multiplication by a constant, where by an “operation” we mean an instruction
         from a typical computer’s set of <em>add</em> and <em>shift</em> instructions. In what follows, we assume this set consists of <em>add, subtract, shift left</em> by any constant amount, and <em>negate</em>. We assume the instruction format is three-address. However, the problem is no easier
         if one is restricted to only <em>add</em> (adding a number to itself, and then adding the sum to itself, and so on, accomplishes
         a shift left of any amount), or if one augments the set by instructions that combine
         a <em>left shift</em> and an <em>add</em> into one instruction (that is, such an instruction computes <strong><em>z</em></strong> ← <strong><em>x</em></strong> + (<strong><em>y</em></strong> <span class="entity">&lt;&lt;</span> <em>n</em>)). We also assume that only the least-significant 32 bits of the product are wanted.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The first improvement to the basic binary decomposition scheme suggested above is
         to use <em>subtract</em> to shorten the sequence when the multiplier contains a group of three or more consecutive
         1-bits. For example, to multiply by 28 (binary 11100), we can compute 32<strong><em>x</em></strong> – 4<strong><em>x</em></strong> (three instructions) rather than 16<strong><em>x</em></strong> + 8<strong><em>x</em></strong> + 4<strong><em>x</em></strong> (five instructions). On two’s-complement machines, the result is correct (modulo
         2<sup>32</sup>) even if the intermediate result of 32<strong><em>x</em></strong> overflows.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">To multiply by a constant <em>m</em> with the basic binary decomposition scheme (using only <em>shift</em>’s and <em>add</em>’s) requires
      </p>
      
      <p class="center">2pop(<em>m</em>) – 1 – δ
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">instructions, where δ = 1 if <em>m</em> ends in a 1-bit (is odd), and δ = 0 otherwise. If <em>subtract</em> is also used, it requires
      </p>
      
      <p class="center">4g(<em>m</em>) + 2s(<em>m</em>) – 1 – δ
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">instructions, where g(<em>m</em>) is the number of groups of two or more consecutive 1-bits in <em>m</em>, s(<em>m</em>) is the number of “singleton” 1-bits in <em>m</em>, and δ has the same meaning as before.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_177"></a>For a group of size 2, it makes no difference which method is used.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The second improvement is to treat specially groups that are separated by a single
         0-bit. For example, consider <em>m</em> = 55 (binary 110111). The group method calculates this as (64<strong><em>x</em></strong> – 16<strong><em>x</em></strong>) + (8<strong><em>x</em></strong> – <strong><em>x</em></strong>), which requires six instructions. Calculating it as 64<strong><em>x</em></strong> – 8<strong><em>x</em></strong> – <strong><em>x</em></strong>, however, requires only four. Similarly, we can multiply by binary 110111011 as illustrated
         by the formula 512<strong><em>x</em></strong> – 64<strong><em>x</em></strong> – 4<strong><em>x</em></strong> – <strong><em>x</em></strong> (six instructions).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The formulas above give an upper bound on the number of operations required to multiply
         a variable <strong><em>x</em></strong> by any given number <em>m</em>. Another bound can be obtained based on the size of <em>m</em> in bits—that is, on <em>n</em> = <span class="entity">⌊</span>log<sub>2</sub> <em>m</em> <span class="entity">⌋</span> + 1.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">T<small>HEOREM</small>. <em>Multiplication of a variable</em> <strong><em>x</em></strong> <em>by an n-bit constant m, m</em> ≥ 1, <em>can be accomplished with at most n instructions of the type add, subtract, and shift
            left by any given amount</em>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Proof</em>. (Induction on <em>n</em>.) Multiplication by 1 can be done in 0 instructions, so the theorem holds for <em>n</em> = 1. For <em>n</em> &gt; 1, if <em>m</em> ends in a 0-bit, then multiplication by <em>m</em> can be accomplished by multiplying by the number consisting of the left <em>n</em> – 1 bits of <em>m</em> (that is, by <em>m</em> / 2), in <em>n</em> – 1 instructions, followed by a <em>shift left</em> of the result by one position. This uses <em>n</em> instructions altogether.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If <em>m</em> ends in binary 01, then <em>m</em><strong><em>x</em></strong> can be calculated by multiplying <strong><em>x</em></strong> by the number consisting of the left <em>n</em> – 2 bits of <em>m</em>, in <em>n</em> – 2 instructions, followed by a <em>left shift</em> of the result by 2, and an <em>add</em> of <strong><em>x</em></strong>. This requires <em>n</em> instructions altogether.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If <em>m</em> ends in binary 11, then consider the cases in which it ends in 0011, 0111, 1011,
         and 1111. Let <strong><em>t</em></strong> be the result of multiplying <strong><em>x</em></strong> by the left <em>n</em> – 4 bits of <em>m</em>. If <em>m</em> ends in 0011, then <em>m</em><strong><em>x</em></strong> = 16<strong><em>t</em></strong> + 2<strong><em>x</em></strong> + <strong><em>x</em></strong>, which requires (<em>n</em> – 4) + 4 = <em>n</em> instructions. If <em>m</em> ends in 0111, then <em>m</em><strong><em>x</em></strong> = 16<strong><em>t</em></strong> + 8<strong><em>x</em></strong> – <strong><em>x</em></strong>, which requires <em>n</em> instructions. If <em>m</em> ends in 1111, then <em>m</em><strong><em>x</em></strong> = 16<strong><em>t</em></strong> + 16<strong><em>x</em></strong> – <strong><em>x</em></strong>, which requires <em>n</em> instructions. The remaining case is that <em>m</em> ends in 1011.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">It is easy to show that <em>m</em><strong><em>x</em></strong> can be calculated in <em>n</em> instructions if <em>m</em> ends in 001011, 011011, or 111011. The remaining case is 101011.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">This reasoning can be continued, with the “remaining case” always being of the form
         101010...10101011. Eventually, the size of <em>m</em> will be reached, and the only remaining case is the number 101010...10101011. This
         <em>n</em>-bit number contains <em>n</em> / 2 + 1 1-bits. By a previous observation, it can multiply <strong><em>x</em></strong> with 2(<em>n</em> / 2 + 1) – 2 = <em>n</em> instructions.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Thus, in particular, multiplication by any 32-bit constant can be done in at most
         32 instructions, by the method described above. By inspection, it is easily seen that
         for <em>n</em> even, the <em>n</em>-bit number 101010...101011 requires <em>n</em> instructions, and for <em>n</em> odd, the <em>n</em>-bit number 1010101...010110 also requires <em>n</em> instructions, so the bound is tight.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The methodology described so far is not difficult to work out by hand or to incorporate
         into an algorithm such as might be used in a compiler; but such an <a id="page_178"></a>algorithm would not always produce the best code, because further improvement is sometimes
         possible. This can result from factoring the multiplier <em>m</em> or some intermediate quantity along the way of computing <em>m</em><strong><em>x</em></strong>. For example, consider again <em>m</em> = 45 (binary 101101). The methods described above require six instructions. Factoring
         45 as 5 · 9, however, gives a four-instruction solution:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/178equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">Factoring can be combined with the binary decomposition methods. For example, multiplication
         by 106 (binary 1101010) requires seven instructions by binary decomposition, but writing
         it as 7 · 15 + 1 leads to a five-instruction solution. For large constants, the smallest
         number of instructions that accomplish the multiplication may be substantially fewer
         than the number obtained by the simple binary decomposition methods described. For
         example, <em>m</em> = 0xAAAAAAAB requires 32 instructions by binary decomposition, but writing this value
         as 2 · 5 · 17 · 257 · 65537 + 1 gives a ten-instruction solution. (Ten instructions
         is probably not typical of large numbers. The factorization reflects the simple bit
         pattern of alternate 1’s and 0’s.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">There does not seem to be a simple formula or procedure that determines the smallest
         number of <em>shift</em> and <em>add</em> instructions that accomplishes multiplication by a given constant <em>m</em>. A practical search procedure is given in [Bern], but it does not always find the
         minimum. Exhaustive search methods to find the minimum can be devised, but they are
         quite expensive in either space or time. (See, for example, the tree structure of
         Figure 15 in [Knu2, 4.6.3].)
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">This should give an idea of the combinatorics involved in this seemingly simple problem.
         Knuth [Knu2, 4.6.3] discusses the closely related problem of computing <em>a<sup>m</sup></em> using a minimum number of multiplications. This is analogous to the problem of multiplying
         by <em>m</em> using only addition instructions.
