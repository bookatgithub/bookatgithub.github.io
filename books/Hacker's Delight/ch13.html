      <h3><a id="ch13lev1"></a><strong>13–1 Gray Code</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">Is it possible to cycle through all 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> combinations of <em>n</em> bits by changing only one bit at a time? The answer is “yes,” and this is the defining
         property of Gray codes. That is, a Gray code is an encoding of the integers such that
         a Gray-coded integer and its successor differ in only one bit position. This concept
         can be generalized to apply to any base, such as decimal, but here we will discuss
         only binary Gray codes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Although there are many binary Gray codes, we will discuss only one: the “reflected
         binary Gray code.” This code is what is usually meant in the literature by the unqualified
         term “Gray code.” We will show, usually without proof, how to do some basic operations
         in this representation of integers, and we will show a few surprising properties.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The reflected binary Gray code is constructed as follows. Start with the strings 0
         and 1, representing the integers 0 and 1:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/311equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">Reflect this about a horizontal axis at the bottom of the list, and place a 1 to the
         left of the new list entries and a 0 to the left of the original list entries:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/311equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">This is the reflected binary Gray code for <em>n</em> = 2. To get the code for <em>n</em> = 3, reflect this and attach a 0 or 1 as before:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/311equ03.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_312"></a>From this construction, it is easy to see by induction on <em>n</em> that (1) each of the 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> bit combinations appears once and only once in the list, (2) only one bit changes
         in going from one list entry to the next, and (3) only one bit changes when cycling
         around from the last entry to the first. Gray codes having this last property are
         called “cyclic,” and the reflected binary Gray code is necessarily cyclic.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If <em>n</em> &gt; 2, there are non-cyclic codes that take on all 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> values once and only once. One such code is 000 001 011 010 110 100 101 111.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a href="ch13.html#ch13fig1">Figure 13–1</a> shows, for <em>n</em> = 4, the integers encoded in ordinary binary and in Gray code. The formulas show
         how to convert from one representation to the other at the bit-by-bit level (as it
         would be done in hardware).
      </p>

      <p class="fig-caption">F<small>IGURE</small> 13–1. 4-bit Gray code and conversion formulas.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">As for the number of Gray codes on <em>n</em> bits, notice that one still has a cyclic binary Gray code after rotating the list
         (starting at any of the 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> positions and cycling around) or reordering the columns. Any combination of these
         operations results in a distinct code. Therefore, there are at least 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> · <em>n</em>! cyclic binary Gray codes on <em>n</em> bits. There are more than this for <em>n</em> ≥ 3.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Gray code and binary representations have the following dual relationships, evident
         from the formulas given in <a href="ch13.html#ch13fig1">Figure 13–1</a>:
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingB">• Bit <em>i</em> of a Gray-coded integer is the parity of bit <em>i</em> and the bit to the left of <em>i</em> in the corresponding binary integer (using 0 if there is no bit to the left of <em>i</em>).
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingB">• Bit <em>i</em> of a binary integer is the parity of all the bits at and to the left of position
         <em>i</em> in the corresponding Gray-coded integer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Converting to Gray from binary can be done in only two instructions:</p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/312equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">The conversion to binary from Gray is harder. One method is given by</p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/312equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">We have already seen this formula in “Computing the Parity of a Word” on page <a href="ch05.html#page_96">96</a>. As mentioned there, this formula can be evaluated as illustrated below for <em>n</em> = 32.

      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">Thus, in general it requires <span class="middle"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/312fig01.jpg" /></span> instructions.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Because it is so easy to convert from binary to Gray, it is trivial to generate successive
         Gray-coded integers:

      <h3><a id="ch13lev2"></a><strong>13-2 Incrementing a Gray-Coded Integer</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">The logic for incrementing a 4-bit <em>binary</em> integer <em>abcd</em> can be expressed as follows, using Boolean algebra notation:
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/313equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent"><a id="page_314"></a>Thus, one way to build a Gray-coded counter in hardware is to build a binary counter
         using the above logic and convert the outputs <em>a</em>′, <em>b</em>′, <em>c</em>′, <em>d</em>′ to Gray by forming the <em>exclusive or</em> of adjacent bits, as shown under “Gray from Binary” in <a href="ch13.html#ch13fig1">Figure 13–1</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A way that might be slightly better is described by the following formulas:</p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/314equ01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">That is, the general case is</p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/314equ02.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="noindent">Because the parity <em>p</em> alternates between 0 and 1, a counter circuit might maintain <em>p</em> in a separate 1-bit register and simply invert it on each count.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In software, the best way to find the successor <em>G</em>′ of a Gray-coded integer <em>G</em> is probably simply to convert <em>G</em> to binary, increment the binary word, and convert it back to Gray code. Another way
         that’s interesting and almost as good is to determine which bit to flip in <em>G</em>. The pattern goes like this, expressed as a word to be <em>exclusive or</em>’d to <em>G</em>:
      </p>
      
      <p class="center">1 2 1 4 1 2 1 8 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 16</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The alert reader will recognize this as a mask that identifies the position of the
         leftmost bit that changes when incrementing the integer 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., corresponding
         to the positions in the above list. Thus, to increment a Gray-coded integer <em>G</em>, the bit position to invert is given by the leftmost bit that changes when 1 is added
         to the binary integer corresponding to <em>G</em>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">This leads to the algorithms for incrementing a Gray-coded integer <em>G</em> as shown in <a href="ch13.html#ch13fig2">Figure 13–2</a>. They both first convert <em>G</em> to binary, which is shown as <code>index(G)</code>.

      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_315"></a>A pencil-and-paper method of incrementing a Gray-coded integer is as follows:
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingNP">Starting from the right, find the first place at which the parity of bits at and to
         the left of the position is even. Invert the bit at this position.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">Or, equivalently:</p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingNP">Let <em>p</em> be the parity of the word <em>G</em>. If <em>p</em> is even, invert the rightmost bit.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indenthangingNP">If <em>p</em> is odd, invert the bit to the left of the rightmost 1-bit.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noindent">The latter rule is directly expressed in the Boolean equations given above.</p>
      
      <h3><a id="ch13lev3"></a><strong>13–3 Negabinary Gray Code</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">If you write the integers in order in base –2 and convert them using the “shift and
         exclusive or” that converts to Gray from straight binary, you get a Gray code. The
         3-bit Gray code has indexes that range over the 3-bit base –2 numbers, namely –2 to
         5. Similarly, the 4-bit Gray code corresponding to 4-bit base –2 numbers has indexes
         ranging from –10 to 5. It is not a reflected Gray code, but it almost is. The 4-bit
         negabinary Gray code can be generated by starting with 0 and 1, reflecting this about
         a horizontal axis at the <em>top</em> of the list, and then reflecting it about a horizontal axis at the <em>bottom</em> of the list, and so on. It is cyclic.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">To convert back to base –2 from this Gray code, the rules are, of course, the same
         as they are for converting to straight binary from ordinary reflected binary Gray
         code (because these operations are inverses, no matter what the interpretation of
         the bit strings is).
      </p>
      
      <h3><a id="ch13lev4"></a><strong>13–4 Brief History and Applications</strong></h3>
      
      <p class="noindent">Gray codes are named after Frank Gray, a physicist at Bell Telephone Laboratories,
         who in the 1930s invented the method we now use for broadcasting color TV in a way
         that’s compatible with the black-and-white transmission and reception methods then
         in existence; that is, when the color signal is received by a black-and-white set,
         the picture appears in shades of gray.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Martin Gardner [Gard] discusses applications of Gray codes involving the Chinese ring
         puzzle, the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, and Hamiltonian paths through graphs that represent
         hypercubes. He also shows how to convert from the decimal representation of an integer
         to a decimal Gray code representation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Gray codes are used in position sensors. A strip of material is made with conducting
         and nonconducting areas, corresponding to the 1’s and 0’s of a Gray-coded integer.
         Each column has a conducting wire brush positioned to read it out. If a brush is positioned
         on the dividing line between two of the quantized positions so that its reading is
         ambiguous, then it doesn’t matter which way the ambiguity is resolved. There can be
         only one ambiguous brush, and interpreting it as a 0 or 1 gives a position adjacent
         to the dividing line.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page_316"></a>The strip can instead be a series of concentric circular tracks, giving a rotational
         position sensor. For this application, the Gray code must be cyclic. Such a sensor
         is shown in <a href="ch13.html#ch13fig3">Figure 13–3</a>, where the four dots represent the brushes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">It is possible to construct cyclic Gray codes for rotational sensors that require
         only one ring of conducting and nonconducting areas, although at some expense in resolution
         for a given number of brushes. The brushes are spaced around the ring rather than
         on a radial line. These codes are called <em>single track Gray codes</em>, or STGCs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The idea is to find a code for which, when written out as in <a href="ch13.html#ch13fig1">Figure 13–1</a>, every column is a rotation of the first column (and that is cyclic, assuming the
         code is for a rotational device). The reflected Gray code for <em>n</em> = 2 is trivially an STGC. STGCs for <em>n</em> = 2 through 4 are shown here.
      </p>
      
      <div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="graphics/316fig01.jpg" /></div>
      
      <p class="indent">STGCs allow the construction of more compact rotational position sensors. A rotational
         STGC device for <em>n</em> = 3 is shown in <a href="ch13.html#ch13fig4">Figure 13–4</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">These are all very similar, simple, and rather uninteresting patterns. Following these
         patterns, an STGC for the case <em>n</em> = 5 would have ten code words, giving a resolution of 36 degrees. It is possible
         to do much better. <a href="ch13.html#ch13fig5">Figure 13–5</a> shows an STGC for <em>n</em> = 5 with 30 code words, giving a resolution of 12 degrees. It is close to the optimum
         of 32 code words.

      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">An STGC has been constructed with exactly 360 code words, with <em>n</em> = 9 (the smallest possible value of <em>n</em>, because any code for <em>n</em> = 8 has at most 256 code words) [HilPat].
