      <p>Foreword from the First Edition</p>
      
      <p>When I first got a summer job at MIT’s Project MAC almost 30 years ago, I was delighted
         to be able to work with the DEC PDP-10 computer, which was more fun to program in
         assembly language than any other computer, bar none, because of its rich yet tractable
         set of instructions for performing bit tests, bit masking, field manipulation, and
         operations on integers. Though the PDP-10 has not been manufactured for quite some
         years, there remains a thriving cult of enthusiasts who keep old PDP-10 hardware running
         and who run old PDP-10 software—entire operating systems and their applications—by
         using personal computers to simulate the PDP-10 instruction set. They even write new
         software; there is now at least one Web site with pages that are served up by a simulated
         PDP-10. (Come on, stop laughing—it’s no sillier than keeping antique cars running.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">I also enjoyed, in that summer of 1972, reading a brand-new MIT research memo called
         HAKMEM, a bizarre and eclectic potpourri of technical trivia.<sup><a id="forfna1"></a><a href="footnotes.html#forfn1">1</a></sup> The subject matter ranged from electrical circuits to number theory, but what intrigued
         me most was its small catalog of ingenious little programming tricks. Each such gem
         would typically describe some plausible yet unusual operation on integers or bit strings
         (such as counting the 1-bits in a word) that could easily be programmed using either
         a longish fixed sequence of machine instructions or a loop, and then show how the
         same thing might be done much more cleverly, using just four or three or two carefully
         chosen instructions whose interactions are not at all obvious until explained or fathomed.
         For me, devouring these little programming nuggets was like eating peanuts, or rather
         bonbons—I just couldn’t stop—and there was a certain richness to them, a certain intellectual
         depth, elegance, even poetry.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">“Surely,” I thought, “there must be more of these,” and indeed over the years I collected,
         and in some cases discovered, a few more. “There ought to be a book of them.”
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">I was genuinely thrilled when I saw Hank Warren’s manuscript. He has systematically
         collected these little programming tricks, organized them thematically, and explained
         them clearly. While some of them may be described in terms of machine instructions,
         this is not a book only for assembly language programmers. The subject matter is basic
         structural relationships among integers and bit strings <a id="page_xiv"></a>in a computer and efficient techniques for performing useful operations on them. These
         techniques are just as useful in the C or Java programming languages as they are in
         assembly language.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Many books on algorithms and data structures teach complicated techniques for sorting
         and searching, for maintaining hash tables and binary trees, for dealing with records
         and pointers. They overlook what can be done with very tiny pieces of data—bits and
         arrays of bits. It is amazing what can be done with just binary addition and subtraction
         and maybe some bitwise operations; the fact that the carry chain allows a single bit
         to affect all the bits to its left makes addition a peculiarly powerful data manipulation
         operation in ways that are not widely appreciated.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Yes, there ought to be a book about these techniques. Now it is in your hands, and
         it’s terrific. If you write optimizing compilers or high-performance code, you must
         read this book. You otherwise might not use this bag of tricks every single day—but
         if you find yourself stuck in some situation where you apparently need to loop over
         the bits in a word, or to perform some operation on integers and it just seems harder
         to code than it ought, or you really need the inner loop of some integer or bit-fiddly
         computation to run twice as fast, then this is the place to look. Or maybe you’ll
         just find yourself reading it straight through out of sheer pleasure.
