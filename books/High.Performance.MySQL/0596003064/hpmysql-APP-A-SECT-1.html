<P class="docText">The <TT>SHOW</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-APP-A-ITERM-1970"></A>
<TT>STATUS</TT> command allows you to view a snapshot of
the many (over 120) internal <A NAME="hpmysql-APP-A-ITERM-1971"></A>status counters that MySQL maintains.
These counters track particular events in MySQL. For example, every
time you issue a <TT>SELECT</TT> query, MySQL increments
the <TT>Com_select</TT> counter.</P>

<P class="docText">This command is valuable because early signs of performance problems
often appear first in the <TT>SHOW</TT>
<TT>STATUS</TT> output—but you have to be looking for
them. By learning which counters are most important to server
performance and how to interpret them, you'll be
well prepared to head off problems before they become an issue for
your users.</P>

<P class="docText">This appendix is designed to do just that. Here
you'll find a brief summary of the more important
counters MySQL provides, as well as some discussion of what to watch
out for and how you might correct some of the problems highlighted
here. We've attempted to group related items
together rather than simply using an alphabetical list. And
we've omitted the counters that have little
relevance to MySQL performance. See the <span class="docEmphasis">MySQL Reference
Manual</span> for a full list of the counters available in your
version of MySQL.</P>

<P class="docText">Running the <TT>SHOW STATUS</TT> command repeatedly and
examining the results is a very tedious process. To make life a bit
easier, <span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span> automates much of the process. See
<A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-APP-B.html#hpmysql-APP-B">Appendix B</A> for more about
<span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that these counters are stored as unsigned integers. On a 32-bit
platform such as Intel x86, that means the counters will wrap just
over the 4.2 billion mark. This can lead to very confusing numbers
and wildly incorrect conclusions. So be sure to check how long your
server has been online (<TT>Uptime</TT>) before jumping to
conclusions. The odds of a counter wrapping increase as time goes on.</P>

<P class="docText">As you read the descriptions in this appendix, consider how you might
add some of these counters to your monitoring infrastructure.
Third-party MySQL modules already exist for most of the freely
available <I>rrdtool</I>-based systems (Cricket, Cacti,
etc.). If none are available for your system, consider using one of
the free plug-ins as a starting point for building your own.
They're not very complicated.</P>

<P class="docText">Studying these values will tell you how often MySQL can fetch the
exact records it needs as opposed to fetching lots of records and
checking field values to see if it really wanted the records.
Generally, the counters help to highlight when MySQL is or

if the <TT>Handler_read_first</TT> is too high, the server
is doing a lot of full index scans, which is probably not what you
want it to do.</P>

<P class="docText">On the other hand, if the <TT>Handler_read_key</TT> value

blocks for MyISAM tables. Generally speaking, a large key buffer

there's not, that's good, because
it means the data was already in memory, and the request never hit
the disk.</P>

<P class="docText">As a general rule of thumb, you want the request numbers to be
roughly 50-100 times higher than the corresponding read or write
numbers. Higher is better! If they're smaller than
that, increasing the size of the key buffer is likely in order.</P>

setting has the largest impact on MySQL's file
descriptor usage if you're mainly using MyISAM
tables. For MyISAM tables, the numbers work out like this: each
<I>.frm</I> file is opened once when the table is first
accessed. The contents are cached, and it is immediately closed. The
index file (<I>.MYI</I>) is opened once and is shared
among all clients accessing it. The data file
(<I>.MYD</I>) is opened by each client using the table.
The table cache may reduce the number of times that the

<TT>ORDER BY</TT> clauses are commonplace, but sorting a
nontrivial number of rows can become a burden if done frequently. The

optimizations present in MySQL 4.0 and beyond. If MySQL
can't use an index for sorting, however, it must
resort to old-fashioned sorting techniques.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">A.1.10 Table Locking</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-APP-A-ITERM-1982"></A>Any
time MySQL waits for a table lock, it is a bad thing. How much of a
bad thing is often a function of the application and usage patterns,
but there's no way around the fact that a MySQL
thread waiting for a lock is getting absolutely no work done. To help
track locks and lock contention on tables, MySQL provides the
following two counters.</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Table_locks_immediate</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Number of times the server acquired a table lock immediately.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Table_locks_waited</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Number of times the server had to wait on a table lock.</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">The goal is to have <TT>Table_locks_immediate</TT> as high
as possible and <TT>Table_locks_waited</TT> as close to
zero as possible. Realistically, there has to be a middle ground, but
those are the ideals we would hope for in a perfect world. For
lower-volume or single user applications, table locks are often a
nonissue. However, on large multiuser systems or high-volume web
sites, table locks can be a very serious problem.</P>

<P class="docText">A high percentage of <TT>Table_locks_waited</TT> is a sign
either that you need to make queries more efficient (so that they
hold locks for a short period of time) or that you may need to
consider an alternative table type. Moving from MyISAM to InnoDB
tables will often greatly reduce lock contention—but not
always. See <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-2.html#hpmysql-CHP-2">Chapter 2</A> for more details about
table locking.<A NAME="hpmysql-APP-A-ITERM-1983"></A></P>
