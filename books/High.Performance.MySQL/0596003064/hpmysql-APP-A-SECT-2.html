<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-APP-A-ITERM-1984"></A>As noted in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-1.html#hpmysql-CHP-1">Chapter 1</A>, the <TT>SHOW INNODB STATUS</TT>
command produces detailed statistics about what's
going on inside the InnoDB storage engine (far more detailed than
anything in MyISAM). A detailed understanding of all the statistics
InnoDB provides is beyond the scope of what most database
administrators will ever need. Much of the information InnoDB
presents is useful only in rare and very specific diagnostic
activities, so we'll keep the discussion fairly
basic here and focus on the more commonly used values.</P>

<P class="docText">Sample output from <TT>SHOW INNODB STATUS</TT> command is
included at the end of this section. The output is broken up into
several labeled groups. For most day to day use, the most informative
sections are Transactions, Buffer Pool and Memory, and Row
Operations.</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Semaphores</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This section details the various locks used inside InnoDB. Higher
values here generally indicate a busy server with frequent contention
inside InnoDB. They are cumulative statistics, however, so the longer
your server has been up, the higher you can expect them to be.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Transactions</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Each of the active or pending transactions is listed in this section.
For each, InnoDB lists the MySQL thread ID as well as the IP address
and MySQL username responsible for initiating the transaction. You
may see indications of transactions waiting on locks here. If so,
there's a good chance your application is
encountering deadlocks.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">File I/O</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Here InnoDB lists the state of each file I/O thread and provides
counts of other I/O-related activity.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Insert Buffer and Adaptive Hash Index</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">When records are added to InnoDB, they are first put into the insert
buffer. From there InnoDB merges records into the tablespace. This
section provides a few metrics generated during those operations.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Log</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The transaction log statistics are presented here, including the
current sequence number and the highest sequence numbers from the
most recent log flush and checkpoint operations. InnoDB also provides
average values for the number of log-related I/O operations per
second.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Buffer Pool and Memory</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This section tells you how well InnoDB is using the memory
you've given it via the
<TT>innodb_buffer_pool</TT> setting. The
"buffer pool size" and
"free buffers" values give you an
idea of how much of that memory is in use. InnoDB also provides
read/create/write-per-second statistics that indicate how quickly the
database pages are changing.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Row Operations</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Here you'll find some very useful high-level numbers
that track the frequency of <TT>INSERT</TT>s,
<TT>UPDATE</TT>s, <TT>DELETE</TT>s, and
<TT>SELECT</TT>s as well as counting the number of rows
affected by each.</P>
