<P class="docText">With the basic operation of
<span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span><A NAME="hpmysql-APP-B-ITERM-1999"></A> covered, let's look at
the steps you take to perform common tasks using
<span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span>. This it intended to give you a hands-on
feel for using <span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span>.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-APP-B-ITERM-2000"></A>When
<span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span> starts, it sorts threads by the Time
column—that is, how long the thread has been in that state.
Those that have most recently changed appear at the top of the
screen. To locate long-running queries, first remove all idle threads
from the display by pressing <span class="docEmphBold">i</span>, then reverse the sort order by
pressing <span class="docEmphBold">o</span>. The resulting display will show the longest running
queries at the top of the screen.</P>
<P class="docList">Once you've located a long-running query, you can
obtain the full query by pressing <span class="docEmphBold">f</span> and entering the thread ID when
prompted. When looking at the full query, you can ask MySQL to
explain the query by pressing <span class="docEmphBold">e</span>. Or you may kill the query by
pressing <span class="docEmphBold">k</span> and supplying the thread ID.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-APP-B-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup></P> <blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-APP-B-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> In MySQL 3.23
and 4.0, killing a query also terminates the
client's connection to the server. In other words,
it kills the connection, and the query dies as a byproduct of
that.</p></blockquote>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-APP-B-ITERM-2001"></A>It's often
useful to know whether MySQL is running more
<TT>SELECT</TT> or more <TT>INSERT</TT> queries.
Maybe you suspect an application is misbehaving, or perhaps
you'd simply like to compute your
server's typical read to write ratio. In
<span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span>'s thread view (<A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-APP-B-SECT-1.html#hpmysql-APP-B-FIG-1">Figure B-1</A>), it displays the percentage of
<TT>SELECT</TT>, <TT>INSERT</TT>,
<TT>UPDATE</TT>, and <TT>DELETE</TT> queries. On
the right side of the header, you'll see something
like this:</P>

<PRE>Se/In/Up/De(%): 61/30/02/05
         ...  63/07/12/10</PRE>

<P class="docList">The first line means that, overall, 61% of the
server's queries are <TT>SELECT</TT>s, 30%
are <TT>INSERT</TT>s, 2% are <TT>UPDATE</TT>s,
and 5% are <TT>DELETE</TT>s. The second line displays
values that apply to the last refresh interval (5 seconds by default)
only. The two together can give a quick feel for what your server has
been doing recently and how that compares to the longer term average.</P>

<P class="docList">If you want more detail, press <span class="docEmphBold">c</span> to switch <span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span>
into command view. There you'll find detailed counts
and percentages for each type of command or query executed. The first
column of numbers summarizes overall counts (since the server was
started or counters reset), while the second set of numbers reflects
the last refresh interval only.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList">Use <span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span>'s
"super-kill" feature by pressing <span class="docEmphBold">K</span>.
You'll be prompted for a username, and
<span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span> will then kill all of that
user's threads. In the future this may be extended
to evaluate more complex expressions, such as killing all nonidle
threads from a given hostname or IP address.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Limit the display to a particular user or host</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">You can ask <span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span> to filter out all threads
except those from a given host or those owned by a given user. If you
press <span class="docEmphBold">u</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span> prompts for a username to filter
on. Similarly, pressing <span class="docEmphBold">h</span> allows you to provide a hostname or IP
address which is used to filter the display. If you supply both,
<span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span> restricts the display based on both
criteria.</P>
<P class="docList">To clear the filtering, you can press <span class="docEmphBold">F</span> to remove all filters at
once. Otherwise, you can use the <span class="docEmphBold">u</span> or <span class="docEmphBold">h</span> keys to remove either of the
filters manually.<A NAME="hpmysql-APP-B-ITERM-2002"></A></P>
