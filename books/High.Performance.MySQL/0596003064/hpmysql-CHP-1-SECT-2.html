<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1026"></A>Configuring a MySQL server is often just a
matter of editing the configuration file to make any changes you need
and then restarting the server. While that sounds rather simple,
adjusting the server's configuration is something
you're not likely to do on a daily basis. More
likely, you've installed MySQL, configured it
minimally or with the defaults, and then let it run. Most users never
go back and adjust the server configuration until a problem arises.
As a result, it's easy to forget how to configure
MySQL.</P>

<P class="docText">Another possibility is that you didn't even know
there was a configuration file for MySQL. For the majority of
projects, MySQL's default configuration is more than
sufficient on modern hardware. It may not be as fast as it can be
(because you haven't optimized it), but it will
certainly meet your basic needs.</P>

<TT><I>datadir</I></TT>/<span class="docEmphasis">my.cnf</span>
specify a value for the TCP port that MySQL should listen to, the
latter takes precedence.</P>

<P class="docText">This behavior can be quite helpful when you need to run
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1031"></A>multiple servers either on the same host or
on several different hosts. You can give all servers an identical
copy of <I>/etc/my.cnf</I> that specifies all the
values that aren't specific to a single host. With
that out of the way, the few host-specific settings can be maintained
in a small supplemental file such as
<TT><I>datadir</I></TT>/<span class="docEmphasis">my.cnf</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">A similar strategy works if you'd like to run
multiple servers on a single host. By putting all the common settings
in <I>/etc/my.cnf</I> and the server-specific settings
in each
<TT><I>datadir</I></TT>/<span class="docEmphasis">my.cnf</span>,
it's easy to keep several servers running with a
minimum of effort.</P>

<P class="docText">For example, perhaps you want to run a couple different instances of
the MySQL server, one for each character set you plan to use (to make
your life easier). You might put all your
"common" settings in
<I>/etc/my.cnf</I> and the following in
<I>/etc/my.english.cnf</I>:</P>

<PRE>default-character-set=latin1
port=3306

<P class="docText">You might even have <I>/etc/my.korean.cnf</I> with:</P>

<PRE>default-character-set=euc_kr
port=3308
socket=/var/lib/mysql/korean.sock</PRE>

<P class="docText">Now, when you start up the three servers, you want each to load all
the settings from the shared <I>/etc/my.cnf</I> file,
and then get settings from one of each of the previous language-based
configuration files. You can use a command like the following:</P>

<PRE>$ <I>mysqld_safe --defaults-extra-file=/etc/my.german.cnf</I>
$ <I>mysqld_safe --defaults-extra-file=/etc/my.english.cnf</I>
$ <I>mysqld_safe --defaults-extra-file=/etc/my.korean.cnf</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">This command yields three different <span class="docEmphasis">mysqld</span>
instances, running on ports 3306 through 3308, each using the
language-specific configuration options mentioned in the file
indicated by the <TT>defaults-extra-file</TT> switch.</P>

<P class="docText">MySQL is usually installed as a service on Windows. As a result,
Windows users must call <I>c:\mysql\bin\mysqld</I>
directly to pass command-line arguments.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">1.2.2 File Format</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1032"></A>The configuration file format consists
of one or more sections, each of which may contain one or more lines.
Sections begin with a name in square brackets, such as
<TT>[</TT><span class="docEmphasis">mysqld</span><TT>]</TT>;
this identifies the program to which the options should be applied.
Each line contains a comment, a key/value pair, a
<TT>set-variable</TT> directive, or a Boolean directive.
Blank lines are ignored.</P>

<P class="docText">Two special section names can occur in each
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1033"></A>configuration file:
<TT>[server]</TT> and <TT>[client]</TT>. Items
listed in the <TT>[server]</TT> block apply to the MySQL
server process. Those in the <TT>[client]</TT> section
apply to all client programs that use the MySQL C client library,
including <span class="docEmphasis">mysql</span>,

<P class="docText">There is no multiline comment format. You can't
place a comment at the end of an otherwise non-empty line:</P>

<P class="docText">The <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1035"></A>key/value pairs are settings such as:</P>

<PRE>set-variable = key_buffer=384M
set-variable = tmp_table_size=32M</PRE>

<P class="docText">Spaces aren't important in
<TT>set-variable</TT> lines. You can also write the two
previous lines as follows:</P>

<PRE>set-variable = key_buffer = 384M
set-variable=tmp_table_size=32M</PRE>

<P class="docText">Either way, MySQL will understand you. However, consider using some
space to enhance readability.</P>

<P class="docText">As of Version 4.1, the <TT>set-variable=</TT> portion of
the variable definition is no longer needed and is deprecated. In
current versions:</P>

<PRE>set-variable = key_buffer=384M</PRE>

<P class="docText">and:</P>

<PRE>key_buffer=384M</PRE>

<P class="docText">are both interpreted in an identical manner by the server at startup
time. If you are running a version that supports leaving out the
<TT>set-variable</TT> clause, it probably is best to do so
because it won't be supported forever.
We've chosen to use the older format here because
it's what you're likely to have
already, and the sample configuration files in the standard MySQL
distribution continue to use it.</P>

<P class="docText">The few boolean directives are just stated plainly:</P>

<PRE>skip-bdb</PRE>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1050"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1051"></A>When
an administrator adjusts the server parameters, it's
common to go through an iterative process that involves making
changes, restarting the server, performing some tests, and repeating
the process. In fact, we'll look at doing just that
in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-3.html#hpmysql-CHP-3">Chapter 3</A>. In the meantime,
it's worth mentioning that you should strongly
consider putting your MySQL <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1052"></A>configuration files into some sort of
revision control system (RCS, CVS, Subversion, etc.). Doing so gives
you an easy way to track changes and back out of a bad configuration
change.</P>

<P class="docText">As of MySQL 4.0, it's possible to change
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1053"></A>server variables on the fly
at runtime. For example, if you wanted to increase the size of the
key buffer from what it was set to at startup, you might do the
following:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>SET GLOBAL key_buffer=50M;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">This sets the global value for <TT>key_buffer</TT> to 50 MB.</P>

<P class="docText">Some variables, such as <TT>sort_buffer_size</TT>, can be
set globally so that they affect all new threads on the server, or
they can be defined so that they apply only to the current MySQL
client session. For example, if you wish to make a series of queries
that might better use a large sort buffer, you can type:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>SET SESSION sort_buffer_size=50M;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Variables set using the
<TT>SESSION</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1054"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1055"></A> syntax are thread-specific and
don't alter the values other threads use.</P>

<P class="docText">It's important to note that any change you make
here, using either
<TT>GLOBAL</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1056"></A> or <TT>SESSION</TT> syntax,
will not survive a restart of the MySQL server; it's
completely transient in that regard. Runtime changes like this are
excellent for testing scenarios such as, "If I
increase my key_buffer value, will it improve my query
performance?" Once you've found a
value that works for you, though, remember to go back to your
<I>/etc/my.cnf</I> file and put that value into your
configuration file, or you may find yourself wondering weeks or
months later why performance was so horrible after that reboot,
completely forgetting the variable change you made on the fly months
prior.</P>

<P class="docText">It's also possible to use arguments on the
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqld_safe</span><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1057"></A> command line to override values
defined in the configuration files. For example, you might do
something like the following:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqld_safe -O key_buffer=50M</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Like the earlier <TT>set-variable</TT> syntax, the
<I>-O</I> syntax is deprecated as of Version 4.0. Here is a
better way to issue that command:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqld_safe --key_buffer=50M</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Command-line argument changes made in the
<I>mysql.server</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1058"></A> startup script will, obviously,
survive from server restart to server restart, as long as that
startup script is used to disable and reenable the server.
It's important to point out, though, that
it's usually better to have all your configuration
declarations in a single place, so that maintenance
doesn't become a game of hide-and-seek with the
configuration options, trying to remember where you set which
values.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-1-ITERM-1059"></A></P>
