<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1895"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1896"></A>The recommended way to change
privileges in MySQL is to use the
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1897"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1898"></A><TT>GRANT</TT> and
<TT>REVOKE</TT> commands. They provide a simple syntax for
making most changes without needing to understand the underlying
grant tables and their various matching rules.</P>

<P class="docText">There's nothing to prevent you from using normal
<TT>INSERT</TT>, <TT>UPDATE</TT>, and
<TT>DELETE</TT> queries to manipulate the grant tables
directly. In fact, many long-time MySQL users still find it easier to
do so. But as MySQL continues to evolve, it is likely that the grant
tables will change. Columns may be added, renamed, or removed (it has
happened before). There may even be additional tables involved in the
process at some point. By sticking to the <TT>GRANT</TT>
and <TT>REVOKE</TT> commands, you can insulate yourself
from those changes. It is also very easy to make very bad mistakes
when modifying the table directly. The <TT>GRANT</TT> and
<TT>REVOKE</TT> commands will continue to be the
recommended way of managing privileges.</P>

<P class="docText">If you do decide to manipulate the grant tables by hand rather than
using the <I>GRANT</I> and <I>REVOKE</I>
commands, you must tell MySQL that you've done so by
issuing a <TT>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</TT> command. MySQL caches
the information contained in the grant tables so that it
doesn't have to go through the expensive process of
reading and interpreting them each time it needs to check a
privilege. As a result, any changes you make with an
<TT>INSERT</TT> or other generic command will go unnoticed
until the server is restarted or a <TT>FLUSH</TT>
<TT>PRIVILEGES</TT> is executed.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.3.2 Common Problems and Limitations</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1917"></A>MySQL doesn't
always act the way you expect it to. Often this is because the
flexibility of its privilege system leads you to expect it to act in
a more sophisticated way than it is designed to act.
Let's take a look at a couple of common ways MySQL
can demonstrate unexpected behavior.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-SECT-3.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.3.2.1 Can't revoke specific privileges</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1918"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1919"></A>One day you decide that
<span class="docEmphasis">raymond</span> shouldn't have read
access to the <TT>payroll</TT> database. He currently has
all privileges. So you try to take away his select privilege for that
database:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>REVOKE SELECT ON payroll.* FROM raymond;</B>
ERROR 1141: There is no such grant defined for user 'raymond' on host '%'</PRE>

<P class="docText">What? Raymond is a DBA and has all privileges,
doesn't he? Let's check:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>SHOW GRANTS FOR raymond \G</B>
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Grants for raymond@%: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'raymond'@'%'
IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '11417e201753de4b' WITH GRANT OPTION</PRE>

<P class="docText">Sure enough, he has every privilege. What's the
problem?</P>

<P class="docText">MySQL isn't as smart is it appears to be. It
provides a way to grant privileges, through the
<TT>user</TT> and <TT>host</TT> and other tables
shown earlier, but it doesn't have a parallel system
to deny privileges. It doesn't have a system for
granting all access except for certain specific items (like the
<I>hosts.allow</I> and <I>hosts.deny</I>
files familiar to Unix system administrators). Essentially, you
can't deny a more specific privilege than you have
granted to a given user.</P>

<P class="docText">The solution to this problem is rather ugly. You have to remove all
the user's privileges, then specifically grant those
you want to keep. This gets messy because you need a
<TT>GRANT</TT> command for every database except
<TT>payroll</TT>.</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db1.* TO raymond WITH GRANT OPTION;</B>
mysql&gt; <B>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db2.* TO raymond WITH GRANT OPTION;</B>
mysql&gt; <B>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db3.* TO raymond WITH GRANT OPTION;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">And so on. This example illustrates the class of problems that
we'll look at next.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-SECT-3.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.3.2.2 Host and database matching can't exclude matches</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1920"></A>The previous example would have been a
lot easier if you could write something like this:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* EXCEPT payroll.* TO raymond;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">But MySQL can't do that. Similarly, if you want to
restrict access from just one host
(<I>insecure.example.com</I>), there's
no way to do it. You can't do this:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO raymond@"%"</B>
    -&gt; <B>EXCEPT raymond@insecure.example.com;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Neither of these work because MySQL was designed to make it easy to
grant privileges but not to deny privileges. From
MySQL's point of view, you deny a privilege by never
granting it in the first place. The result is a system that makes it
easy to build <I>inclusive</I> rules but makes it
impossible to build <I>exclusive</I> rules.</P>

<P class="docText">If you want to allow <span class="docEmphasis">raymond</span> to connect from any
host except <I>insecure.example.com, </I>you have to
either block that host at the network level or add a record with a
bogus password to the <TT>user</TT> table for
<I>raymond@insecure.example.com.</I> In the latter
case, Raymond can connect but authentication will always fail.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.3.2.3 Privileges don't vanish when objects do</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1921"></A>It should be noted that there is one
serious design flaw in the way MySQL handles privileges. That problem
is that there is no <TT>GRANT</TT> clean-up when database
objects are removed.</P>

<P class="docText">For example, let's say you've done
the following:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_db.* TO raymond;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">You later run the following command:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqladmin drop my_db</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">In a well-designed privileges system, that <TT>GRANT</TT>
would find itself destroyed as part of the dropping of the databases
it referenced.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-10-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> With MySQL, however, the privileges remain in the
<TT>db</TT> table.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> At the very least, there would be a
configuration option to permit the destruction to happen.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">At first glance, you may think to yourself, "Why do
I care? Since <TT>my_db</TT> is dropped,
there's nothing there to see." But
what if a couple months or years later, you create a new database
called <TT>my_db</TT>? Do you still want Raymond to have
access to the new table? Do you even remember that he has access to
it?</P>

<P class="docText">The solution—let's call it a workaround,
because that's what it is—is for the admin,
when dropping a database or table, to scour and directly access the
appropriate privileges tables. In the <TT>my_db</TT>
example, if you drop the <TT>my_db</TT> table, you might
want to do something like this:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>DELETE FROM db where Db='my_db';</B>
mysql&gt; <B>DELETE FROM tables_priv where Db='my_db';</B>
mysql&gt; <B>DELETE FROM columns_priv where Db='my_db';</B>
mysql&gt; <B>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">In some cases, it might be possible to do this using the
<TT>REVOKE</TT> command multiple times for each user that
may have been granted privileges, but it's probably
much faster and more secure to access the privileges tables as just
shown, and be sure to make a clean sweep across them. Likewise, if
you dropped only a particular table in <TT>my_db</TT>, say,
<TT>my_db.my_table</TT>, you might do this:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>DELETE FROM tables_priv where Db='my_db' AND Table_name='my_table';</B>
mysql&gt; <B>DELETE FROM columns_priv where Db='my_db' AND Table_name='my_table';</B>
mysql&gt; <B>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Obviously, no <TT>DELETE</TT> is needed against the
<TT>db</TT> table because it isn't a
database-wide privilege that needs to be revoked.</P>

<P class="docText">In some cases, you might find this useful. For example, if
you're dropping a table just to reload it again from
backup, it's much more convenient not to have to
worry about revoking and regranting privileges.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-10-FNOTE-4">[4]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-FNOTE-4">[4]</A></sup> An
argument can be made that if you're restoring from a
backup and leaving the existing privileges in place,
you're not necessarily restoring to the backed-up
state and might be leaving any security holes that were created
afterwards still in place.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">In an ideal world, this would be an option to commands like
<TT>ALTER</TT> <TT>TABLE</TT> or
<TT>DROP</TT> <TT>DATABASE</TT>, to allow the
system to hunt down and destroy granted privileges automatically.
Alternatively, MySQL could default to a theoretically
"secure" methodology of destroying
stale privileges but offer the option to leave the privileges
intact.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-10-ITERM-1922"></A></P>
