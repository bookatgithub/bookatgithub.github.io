<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1082"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1083"></A>The first of those problems is how
to deal with concurrency and locking. In any data repository you have
to be careful when more than one person, process, or client needs to
change data at the same time. Consider, for example, a classic email
box on a Unix system. The popular <I>mbox</I> file
format is incredibly simple. Email messages are simply concatenated
together, one after another. This simple format makes it very easy to
read and parse mail messages. It also makes mail delivery easy: just
append a new message to the end of the file.</P>

<P class="docText">But what happens when two processes try to deliver messages at the
same time to the same mailbox? Clearly that can corrupt the mailbox,
leaving two interleaved messages at the end of the mailbox file. To
prevent corruption, all well-behaved mail delivery systems implement
a form of locking to prevent simultaneous delivery from occurring. If
a second delivery is attempted while the mailbox is locked, the
second process must wait until it can acquire the lock before
delivering the message.</P>

<P class="docText">This scheme works reasonably well in practice, but it provides rather
poor concurrency. Since only a single program may make any changes to
the mailbox at any given time, it becomes problematic with a
high-volume mailbox, one that receives thousands of messages per
minute. This exclusive locking makes it difficult for mail delivery
not to become backlogged if someone attempts to read, respond to, and
delete messages in that same mailbox. Luckily, few mailboxes are
actually that busy.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-2.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.2.1 Read/Write Locks</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1084"></A>Reading
from the mailbox isn't as troublesome.
There's nothing wrong with multiple clients reading
the same mailbox simultaneously. Since they aren't
making changes, nothing is likely to go wrong. But what happens if
someone tries to delete message number 25 while programs are reading
the mailbox? It depends. A reader could come away with a corrupted or
inconsistent view of the mailbox. So to be safe, even reading from a
mailbox requires special care.</P>

<P class="docText">Database tables are no different. If you think of each mail message
as a record and the mailbox itself as a table, it's
easy to see that the problem is the same. In many ways, a mailbox is
really just a simple database table. Modifying records in a database
table is very similar to removing or changing the content of messages
in a mailbox file.</P>

<P class="docText">The solution to this classic problem is rather simple. Systems that
deal with concurrent read/write access typically implement a
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1085"></A>locking system that consists of two lock
types. These locks are usually known as <I>shared
locks</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1086"></A> and <I>exclusive
locks</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1087"></A>, or <I>read
locks</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1088"></A>
and <I>write locks</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1089"></A>.</P>

<P class="docText">Without worrying about the actual locking technology, we can describe
the concept as follows. Read locks on a resource are shared: many
clients may read from the resource at the same time and not interfere
with each other. Write locks, on the other hand, are exclusive,
because it is safe to have only one client writing to the resource at
given time and to prevent all reads when a client is writing. Why?
Because the single writer is free to make any changes to the
resource—even deleting it entirely.</P>

<P class="docText">In the database world, locking happens all the time. MySQL has to
prevent one client from reading a piece of data while another is
changing it. It performs this lock management internally in a way
that is transparent much of the time.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-2.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.2.2 Lock Granularity</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1090"></A>One way to improve the concurrency
of a shared resource is to be more selective about what is locked.
Rather than locking the entire resource, lock only the part that
contains the data you need to change. Better yet, lock only the exact
piece of data you plan to change. By decreasing the amount of data
that is locked at any one time, more changes can occur
simultaneously—as long as they don't conflict
with each other.</P>

<P class="docText">The downside of this is that locks aren't free.
There is overhead involved in obtaining a lock, checking to see
whether a lock is free, releasing a lock, and so on. All this
business of lock management can really start to eat away at
performance because the system is spending its time performing lock
management instead of actually storing and retrieving data. (Similar
things happen when too many managers get involved in a software
project.)</P>

<P class="docText">To achieve the best performance overall, some sort of balance is
needed. Most commercial database servers don't give
you much choice: you get what is known as row-level locking in your
tables. MySQL, on the other hand, offers a choice in the matter.
Among the storage engines you can choose from in MySQL,
you'll find three different granularities of
locking. Let's have a look at them.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-2.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.2.2.1 Table locks</H5>

<P class="docText">The most basic and low-overhead locking strategy available is a
<I>table lock</I>, which is analogous to the mailbox
locks described earlier. The table as a whole is locked on an
all-or-nothing basis. When a client wishes to write to a table
(insert, delete, or update, etc.), it obtains a write lock that keeps
all other read or write operations at bay for the duration of the
operation. Once the write has completed, the table is unlocked to
allow those waiting operations to continue. When nobody is writing,
readers obtain read locks that allow other readers to do the same.</P>

<P class="docText">For a long time, MySQL provided only table locks, and this caused a
great deal of concern among database geeks. They warned that MySQL
would never scale up beyond toy projects and work in the real world.
However, MySQL is so much faster than most commercial databases that
table locking doesn't get in the way nearly as much
as the naysayers predicted it would.</P>

<P class="docText">Part of the reason MySQL doesn't suffer as much as
expected is because the majority of applications for which it is used
consist primarily of read queries. In fact, the
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1091"></A>MyISAM engine
(MySQL's default) was built assuming that 90% of all
queries run against it will be reads. As it turns out, MyISAM tables
perform very well as long as the ratio of reads to writes is very
high or very low.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-2.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.2.2.2 Page locks</H5>

<P class="docText">A slightly more expensive form of locking that offers greater
concurrency than table locking, a <I>page
lock</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1092"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1093"></A> is a lock applied to a portion of a table
known as a page. All the records that reside on the same page in the
table are affected by the lock. Using this scheme, the main factor
influencing concurrency is the page size; if the pages in the table
are large, concurrency will be worse than with smaller pages.
MySQL's BDB (Berkeley DB) tables use page-level
locking on 8-KB pages.</P>

<P class="docText">The only hot spot in page locking is the last page in the table. If
records are inserted there at regular intervals, the last page will
be locked frequently.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-2.2.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.2.2.3 Row locks</H5>

<P class="docText">The locking style that offers the greatest concurrency (and carries
the greatest overhead) is the <I>row
lock</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1094"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1095"></A>. In most applications,
it's relatively rare for several clients to need to
update the exact same row at the same time. Row-level locking, as
it's commonly known, is available in
MySQL's InnoDB tables. InnoDB
doesn't use a simple row locking mechanism, however.
Instead it uses row-level locking in conjunction with a
multiversioning scheme, so let's have a look at
that.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-2.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.2.3 Multi-Version Concurrency Control</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1096"></A>There is
a final technique for increasing concurrency: Multi-Version
Concurrency Control (MVCC). Often referred to simply as
<I>versioning</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1097"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1098"></A>,
MVCC is used by Oracle, by PostgreSQL, and by
MySQL's InnoDB storage engine. MVCC can be thought
of as a new twist on row-level locking. It has the added benefit of
allowing nonlocking reads while still locking the necessary records
only during write operations. Some of MVCC's other
properties will be of particular interest when we look at
transactions in the next section.</P>

<P class="docText">So how does this scheme work? Conceptually, any query against a table
will actually see a snapshot of the data as it existed at the time
the query began—no matter how long it takes to execute. If
you've never experienced this before, it may sound a
little crazy. But give it a chance.</P>

<P class="docText">In a versioning system, each row has two additional, hidden values
associated with it. These values represent when the row was created
and when it was expired (or deleted). Rather than storing the actual
time at which these events occur, the database stores the version
number at the time each event occurred. The <I>database
version</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1099"></A> (or <I>system
version</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1100"></A>) is a number that increments each time
a query<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-2-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> begins. We'll
call these two values the <I>creation
id</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1101"></A>
and the <I>deletion
id</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1102"></A>.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> That's not quite true. As
you'll see when we start talking about transactions
later, the version number is incremented for each transaction rather
than each query.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Under MVCC, a final duty of the database server is to keep track of
all the running queries (with their associated version numbers).
Let's see how this applies to particular operations:</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">SELECT</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">When records are selected from a table, the server must examine each
row to ensure that it meets several criteria:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Its creation id must be less than or equal to the system version
number. This ensures that the row was created before the current
query began.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Its deletion id, if not null, must be greater than the current system
version. This ensures that the row wasn't deleted
before the current query began.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Its creation id can't be in the list of running
queries. This ensures that the row wasn't added or
changed by a query that is still running.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Rows that pass all of these tests may be returned as the result of
the query.</P></LI></UL>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">INSERT</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">When a row is added to a table, the database server records the
current version number along with the new row, using it as the
row's creation id.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">DELETE</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">To delete a row, the database server records the current version
number as the row's deletion id.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">UPDATE</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">When a row is modified, the database server writes a new copy of the
row, using the version number as the new row's
creation id. It also writes the version number as the old
row's deletion id.</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">The result of all this extra record keeping is that read queries
never lock tables, pages, or rows. They simply read data as fast as
they can, making sure to select only rows that meet the criteria laid
out earlier. The drawbacks are that the server has to store a bit
more data with each row and do a bit more work when examining rows.
