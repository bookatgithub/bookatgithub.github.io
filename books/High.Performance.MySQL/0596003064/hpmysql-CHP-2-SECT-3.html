<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1106"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1107"></A>You can't examine
the more advanced features of a database system for very long before
transactions enter the mix. A
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1108"></A>transaction is
a group of SQL queries that are treated
<I>atomically</I>, as a single unit of work. Either
the entire group of queries is applied to a database, or none of them
are. Little of this section is specific to MySQL. If
you're already familiar with ACID transactions, feel
free to skip ahead to the section "Transactions in
MySQL."</P>

<P class="docText">A banking application is the classic example of why transactions are
necessary. Imagine a bank's database with a two
tables: checking and savings. To move $200 from
Jane's checking account to her savings account, you
need to perform at least three steps:</P>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Make sure her checking account balance is greater than $200.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Subtract $200 from her checking account balance.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Add $200 to her savings account balance.</P></span></LI></OL></span>
<P class="docText">The entire operation should be wrapped in a transaction so that if
any one of the steps fails, they can all be rolled back.</P>

<P class="docText">A transaction is initiated (or opened) with the
<TT>BEGIN</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1109"></A> statement and applied with
<TT>COMMIT</TT> or <I>rolled back</I>
(undone) with <TT>ROLLBACK</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1110"></A>. So the SQL for the transaction might
look like this:</P>

<PRE>         BEGIN;
[step 1] SELECT balance FROM checking WHERE customer_id = 10233276;
[step 2] UPDATE checking SET balance = balance - 200.00 WHERE customer_id = 10233276;
[step 3] UPDATE savings  SET balance = balance + 200.00 WHERE customer_id = 10233276;
         COMMIT;</PRE>

<P class="docText">But transactions alone aren't the whole story. What
happens if the database server crashes while performing step 3? Who
knows? The customer probably just lost $200. What if another process
comes along between Steps 2 and 3 and removes the entire checking
account balance? The bank has given the customer a $200 credit
without even knowing it.</P>

<P class="docText">Simply having transactions isn't sufficient unless
the database server passes what is known as the <I>ACID
test</I>. <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1111"></A>ACID is an acronym
for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability—four
tightly related criteria that are required in a well-behaved
transaction processing system. Transactions that meet those four
criteria are often referred to as <I>ACID
transactions</I>.</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Atomicity</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Transactions must function as a single indivisible unit of work. The
entire transaction is either applied or rolled back. When
transactions are atomic, there is no such thing as a partially
completed transaction: it's all or nothing.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Consistency</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The database should always move from one consistent state to the
next. Consistency ensures that a crash between Steps 2 and 3
doesn't result in $200 missing from the checking
account. Because the transaction is never committed, none of the
transaction's changes are ever reflected in the
database.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Isolation</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The results of a transaction are usually invisible to other
transactions until the transaction is complete. This ensures that if
a bank account summary runs after Step 2, but before Step 3, it still
sees the $200 in the checking account. When we discuss isolation
levels, you'll understand why we said
<span class="docEmphasis">usually</span> invisible.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Durability</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Once committed, the results of a transaction are permanent. This
means that the changes must be recorded in such a way that system
crashes won't lose the data. Of course, if the
database server's disks fail, all bets are off.
That's a hardware problem. We'll
talk more about how you can minimize the effects of hardware failures
in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-6.html#hpmysql-CHP-6">Chapter 6</A>.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.3.1 Benefits and Drawbacks</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1112"></A>ACID transactions ensure
that banks don't lose your money. By wrapping
arbitrarily complex logic into single units of work, the database
server takes some of the burden off application developers. The
database server's ACID properties offer guarantees
that reduce the need for code guarding against race conditions and
handling crash recovery.</P>

<P class="docText">The downside of this extra security is that the database server has
to do more work. It also means that a database server with ACID
transactions will generally require more CPU power, memory, and disk
space than one without them. As mentioned earlier, this is where
MySQL's modularity comes into play. Because you can
decide on a per-table basis if you need ACID transactions or not, you
don't need to pay the performance penalty on a table
that really won't benefit from transactions.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-3.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.3.2 Isolation Levels</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1113"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1114"></A>The previous description of isolation
was a bit simplistic. Isolation is more complex than it might first
appear because of some peculiar cases that can occur. The SQL
standard defines four isolation levels with specific rules for which
changes are and aren't visible inside and outside a
transaction. Let's look at each isolation level and
the type of problems that can occur.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-3.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.3.2.1 Read uncommitted</H5>

<P class="docText">In the <I>read
uncommitted</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1115"></A> isolation level, transactions can view
the results of uncommitted transactions. At this level, many problems
can occur unless you really, really know what you are doing and have
a good reason for doing it. Read uncommitted is rarely used in
practice. Reading uncommitted data is also known as a
<I>dirty read</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1116"></A>.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-3.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.3.2.2 Read committed</H5>

<P class="docText">The default isolation level for most database systems is
<I>read committed</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1117"></A>. It satisfies the
simple definition of isolation used earlier. A transaction will see
the results only of transactions that were already committed when it
began, and its changes won't be visible to others
until it's committed.</P>

<P class="docText">However, there are problems that can occur using that definition. To
visualize the problems, refer to the sample data for the
<TT>Stock</TT> and <TT>StockPrice</TT> tables as
shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-2-TABLE-2">Table 2-2</A> and <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-2-TABLE-3">Table 2-3</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">Imagine you have a Perl script that runs nightly to fetch price data
about your favorite stocks. For each stock, it fetches the data and
adds a record to the <TT>StockPrice</TT> table with the
day's numbers. So to update the information for
Amazon.com, the transaction might look like this:</P>

<PRE>BEGIN;
SELECT @id := id FROM Stock WHERE ticker = 'AMZN';
INSERT INTO StockPrice VALUES (@id, '2002-05-03', 20.50, 21.10, 20.08, 21.02);
COMMIT;</PRE>

<P class="docText">But what if, between the select and insert, Amazon's
<TT>id</TT> changes from 4 to 17 and a new stock is added
with <TT>id</TT> 4? Or what if Amazon is removed entirely?
You'll end up inserting a record with the wrong
<TT>id</TT> in the first case. And in the second case,
you've inserted a record for which there is no
longer a corresponding row in the <TT>Stock</TT> table.
Neither of these is what you intended.</P>

<P class="docText">The problem is that you have a <I>nonrepeatable
read</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1118"></A> in the query. That is, the data you read
in the <TT>SELECT</TT> becomes invalid by the time you
execute the <TT>INSERT</TT>. The repeatable read isolation
level exists to solve this problem.</P>

<P class="docText">At the <I>repeatable
read</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1119"></A> isolation level, any rows that are read
during a transaction are locked so that they can't
be changed until the transaction finishes. This provides the perfect
solution to the problem mentioned in the previous section, in which
Amazon's <TT>id</TT> can change or vanish
entirely. However, this isolation level still leaves the door open to
another tricky problem: phantom reads.</P>

<P class="docText">Using the same data, imagine that you have a script that performs
some analysis based on the data in the <TT>StockPrice</TT>
table. And let's assume it does this while the
nightly update is also running.</P>

<P class="docText">The analysis script does something like this:</P>

<PRE>BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM StockPrice WHERE close BETWEEN 10 and 20;
// think for a bit
SELECT * FROM StockPrice WHERE close BETWEEN 10 and 20;
COMMIT;</PRE>

<P class="docText">But the nightly update script inserts between those two queries new
rows that happen to match the <TT>close BETWEEN 10 and
20</TT> condition. The second query will find more rows that the
first one! These additional rows are known as <I>phantom
rows</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1120"></A> (or simply phantoms). They
weren't locked the first time because they
didn't exist when the query ran.</P>

<P class="docText">Having said all that, we need to point out that this is a bit more
academic than you might think. Phantom rows are such a common problem
that InnoDB's locking (known as <I>next-key
locking</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1121"></A>) prevents this from happening. Rather
than locking only the rows you've touched in a
query, InnoDB actually locks the slot following them in the index

<P class="docText">If you're unlucky, each transaction will execute its
first query and update a row of data, locking it in the process. Each
transaction will then attempt to update its second row only to find
that it is already locked. Left unchecked, the two transactions will
wait for each other to complete—forever.</P>

<P class="docText">To combat this problem, database systems implement various forms of
deadlock detection and timeouts. The more sophisticated systems, such
as InnoDB, will notice circular dependencies like the previous
example and return an error. Others will give up after the query
exceeds a timeout while waiting for a lock. InnoDB's
default timeout is 50 seconds. In either case, applications that use
transactions need to be able to handle deadlocks and possibly retry
transactions.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1129"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1130"></A>Some of the overhead involved with
transactions can be mitigated through the use of a transaction log.
Rather than directly updating the tables on disk each time a change
occurs, the system can update the in-memory copy of the data (which
is very fast) and write a record of the change to a
<I>transaction log</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1131"></A> on disk. Then, at some later time, a
process (or thread) can actually apply the changes that the
transaction log recorded. The serial disk I/O required to append
events to the log is much faster than the random seeks required to
update data in various places on disk.</P>

<P class="docText">As long as events are written to the transaction log before a
transaction is considered committed, having the changes in a log will
not affect the durability of the system. If the database server
crashes before all changes have been applied from the transaction
log, the database will continue applying changes from the transaction
log when it is restarted and before it accepts new connections.</P>

<TT>AUTOCOMMIT</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1134"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1135"></A> mode. This means that unless
you've explicitly begun a transaction, it

enable <TT>AUTOCOMMIT</TT> for the current connection by
running:</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1142"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1143"></A>Transaction management in MySQL
is currently handled by the underlying storage engines, not at a
higher level. Thus, you can't reliably mix tables
stored in transactional engines (such as InnoDB and BDB) in a single
transaction. A higher-level transaction management service may
someday be added to MySQL, making it safe to mix and match
transaction-safe tables in a transaction. Until then,
don't expect it to work.</P>

<P class="docText">If you mix transaction-safe and non-transaction-safe tables (such as
InnoDB and MyISAM) in a transaction, the transaction will work
properly if all goes well. However, if a rollback is required, the
changes to the non-transaction-safe table won't be
undone. This leaves the database in an inconsistent state that may be
difficult to recover from (and renders the entire point of
transactions moot).</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-SECT-3.5.5"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.3.5.5 Simulating transactions</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1144"></A>At times you may
need the behavior of transactions when you aren't
using a transaction-safe table. You can achieve something like
transactions using MySQL's
<TT>LOCK</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1145"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1146"></A> <TT>TABLES</TT> and
<TT>UNLOCK</TT> <TT>TABLES</TT> commands. If you
lock the tables that will be involved in the transaction and keep
track of any changes that you make (in case you need to simulate a
rollback), you'll have something equivalent to
running at the serializable isolation level. But the process is
kludgy and error prone, so if you really need transactions, we
recommend using a transactional storage engine.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1147"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-2-ITERM-1148"></A></P>
