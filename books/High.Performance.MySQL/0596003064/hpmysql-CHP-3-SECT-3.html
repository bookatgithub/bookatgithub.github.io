this chapter we'll introduce three useful
benchmarking tools:</P>

between different database engines or different installations of one

site-specific data or needs.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">MySQL super-smack, a stress-testing tool.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">MyBench, a tool developed in Perl by one of the authors. It is

<P class="docText">The <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1254"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1255"></A>benchmark tools presented in this chapter
may not run under Windows due to the lack of a Perl interpreter or
binaries compiled for Windows. Because versions of Perl for Windows
are readily (and freely) available from ActiveState,
there's a good chance MyBench may work. However,
neither of the authors use Windows, and we have not tried to confirm
this.</P>

<P class="docText">However, these tools do run on Linux and most Unix-like platforms and
can be used to test remote servers. So you might run them on Linux or
Solaris to remotely benchmark a Windows 2000 server running MySQL.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.3.1 The MySQL Benchmark Suite</H4>

<P class="docText">The <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1256"></A>MySQL distribution comes with a rather
comprehensive set of generic tests that have been bundled together so
you can run them as a group and examine the results. The tests will
do little to help you figure out whether a configuration change will
speed up your application. But they're very helpful
when used as a high-level benchmark, meaning they provide a good
overall indication of how well one server performs relative to
another.</P>

<P class="docText">You can also run the tests individually if you'd
like compare a subset of the results from several servers. If
you're mainly interested in
<TT>UPDATE</TT> speed, run one of the
<TT>UPDATE</TT>-intensive tests a few times on each server.</P>

<P class="docText">The benchmark suite can be used to test <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1257"></A>non-MySQL servers as well. According
to the <I>README</I>, PostgreSQL, Solid, and mSQL have
been tested. This may be helpful if you're trying to
choose between MySQL and PostgreSQL. All the benchmark code is
relatively generic Perl using the DBI and Benchmark modules. If
needed, you can add support for nearly any database server that has a
DBI driver (Oracle, Sybase, Informix, DB2, etc.). If you do so, be
sure to look at the <I>bench-init.pl</I> for any global
options you may need to add or change.</P>

<P class="docText">By running the benchmarks against several different servers,
you'll get an idea of how much faster one server is
than another. The tests are largely CPU-bound, but there are portions
of the test that demand a lot of disk I/O (for short times).
You'll likely find that the 2.4-GHz CPU
doesn't necessarily make MySQL run twice as fast as
the 1.2-GHz CPU.</P>

<P class="docText">The <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1258"></A>benchmark suite will not help you test the
benefits of multi-CPU machines because the benchmark process is
completely serialized. It executes one query after another, so MySQL
will not benefit from the addition of a second CPU. To test that,
you'll need to use MySQL super-smack or a home-grown
solution. Both are covered in the following sections.</P>

<P class="docText">To run the tests, use the <I>run-all-tests</I> script
located in the <I>sql-bench</I> directory. Be sure to
read the <I>README</I> in that directory. It provides a
complete list of the command-line options you can use.</P>

<PRE>$ <B>cd sql-bench</B>
sql-bench$ <B>./run-all-tests --server=mysql --user=root --log --fast</B>
Test finished. You can find the result in:
output/RUN-mysql_fast-Linux_2.4.18_686_smp_i686</PRE>

<P class="docText">The benchmarks may take quite a while to run, depending on your
hardware and configuration. On a dual 933-MHz Pentium 3, it took over
an hour to execute the tests using MySQL 4.0.13.
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1259"></A>While
it's running, however, you can watch the progress.
The <TT>--log</TT> flag causes results from each test to be
logged in a subdirectory named <I>output</I>. Each file
contains a series of timings for the various operations in each
benchmark test. Here's a small sampling, slightly
reformatted for printing:</P>

<P class="docText">As you can see, the <TT>count_distinct_group_on_key</TT>
<TT>(1000:6000)</TT> test took 34

run the test. The other values (<TT>usr</TT>,
<TT>sys</TT>, <TT>cursr</TT>,
<TT>csys</TT>) that added up to 0.28 seconds constitute the
overhead for this test. That's how much of the time
was spent running the benchmark client code rather than waiting for
the MySQL server's response. This means that the
figure we care about—how much time was tied up by things
outside the client's control—totalled 33.72

<P class="docText">It's also worth noting that you can run the tests

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-SECT-3.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.3.2 MySQL super-smack</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1262"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1263"></A>Developed by
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1264"></A>Sasha Pachev,
a former MySQL AB employee, super-smack is a stress-testing tool that
can talk to both MySQL and PostgreSQL. The super-smack tool really
deserves wider recognition, because it's very
powerful. Using a simple configuration file syntax, you can define a
series of tests (a <I>query
barrel</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1265"></A>) to run against your server along with
the data and tables needed to support the tests. When running the
tests, you control how many concurrent clients will be simulated (one
per thread) and how many iterations of each test the clients will
execute using command-line arguments.</P>

<P class="docText">Because the tool simulates many simultaneous users, it works very
well for testing multi-CPU servers. And even on single CPU machines,
it allows you to generate more realistic test scenarios as well as
perform stress tests.</P>

<P class="docText">A typical test with super-smack involves creating one or more large
tables and populating them with various data, chosen from an input
file or generated on the fly. It then proceeds to beat on the created
tables using a series of queries that are defined by the user via a
configuration file. The values used in the queries are selected from
an external file in either random or sequential order.</P>

<P class="docText">As you'll see, using MySQL super-smack requires more
work than using the supplied benchmarks. While it will take some time
to get super-smack set up and running the first time,
you'll benefit from having much greater control over
the tests. With a little practice, you can create custom tailored
benchmarks in very little time.</P>

<P class="docText">You'll first need to download and build super-smack
before you can begin testing; it doesn't come with
MySQL. <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1266"></A>As
of this writing, the current release is available from <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/super-smack/">http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/super-smack/</A>.
It uses <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1267"></A>GNU
<I>autoconf</I>, so the installation process is
relatively simple as long as your build tools are reasonably current.</P>

<PRE>/tmp$ <B>tar -zxf super-smack-1.1.tar.gz</B>

<P class="docText">Be sure to read the <I>MANUAL</I> and
<I>TUTORIAL</I> files included in the distribution.
They cover topics that we may not—especially if
you're using a newer version.</P>

<P class="docText">To get started with super-smack, let's look at the
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1268"></A>example benchmarks it includes. In
<I>/usr/share/smacks</I>, you'll find
a small collection of <I>smack</I> files:</P>

<P class="docText">These files contain the commands necessary to populate a table and
execute a bunch of queries against it. Before diving into the
configuration file, let's give it a quick run.
We'll ask it to simulate 30 concurrent users, each
running 10,000 iterations of the test queries.</P>

<P class="docText">The test requires a table named <TT>http_auth</TT> to
operate. Since the table didn't exist, the test used
the data in <I>/var/smack-data/words.dat</I> to
populate the table. Then super-smack ran the tests and produced
results.</P>

<P class="docText">After the "Query Barrel Report"
line, you can see the performance stats from this benchmark run. (A
query barrel, as you'll see later, is a set of
queries run by super-smack in each iteration.) The first line
provides connection stats, which list the maximum, minimum, and
average connection times for each of the 30 clients—that is,
how long the client waited for the server when establishing a
connection.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-3-FNOTE-2">[2]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-FNOTE-2">[2]</A></sup> The super-smack tool uses persistent
connections. Each client connects once and remains connected for the
duration of the test run. You can't use super-smack
to simulate nonpersistent connections.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">The remaining lines provide statistics for each type of test defined
in the <I>smack</I> file. For each, you see the number
of times the query was executed (this should always match what you
specified on the command line), the maximum time the query took, the
minimum time the query took, and the number of queries executed per
second.</P>

<P class="docText">Running with different values (fewer clients),
you'll see the performance was actually higher:
3,306 queries/sec versus 2,726 queries/sec.</P>

<P class="docText">That's likely because we ran the super-smack client
on the same machine as MySQL, so the two were competing for CPU time.
In real-world testing, you'd probably have the
client and server separated, and you'd want to run
the same benchmark several times to rule out any anomalies.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-SECT-3.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">3.3.2.1 Preparing test data</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1269"></A>Using the
<I>words.dat</I> data as input works in the
<TT>http_auth</TT> benchmark, but when testing your
applications, you'll need to supply your own data.
There is no one-size-fits-all answer for how to generate your test
data. You have to determine what data to create or extract for use in
the tests. Once you've done that and loaded the data
into MySQL, you need to extract the relevant values into a file that
super-smack can read during testing.</P>

<P class="docText">For example, if you're testing an online product
catalog in which items will be selected based on their product ID,
you'll need a list of product IDs to use during
testing. For a comprehensive test, use all the product IDs. If you
have millions of products, it may be sufficient to test a subset of
them.</P>

<P class="docText">In either case, first get a list of the product IDs into a text file
that you can then drop into <I>/var/smack-data/</I> to
use during the testing. The easiest way to do that to use
MySQL's <TT>SELECT</TT>
<TT>.</TT>.. <TT>INTO</TT>
<TT>OUTFILE</TT> construct:</P>

<PRE>SELECT id INTO OUTFILE "/tmp/product.dat" FROM product</PRE>

<P class="docText">That produces a file containing one product ID per line—perfect
for use with super-smack. If your test requires multiple columns of
data, you can produce a file of quoted comma-separated values:</P>

<PRE>SELECT id, type INTO OUTFILE "/tmp/product.dat"
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY "\n"
FROM product</PRE>

<P class="docText">super-smack allows you to specify a field delimiter to be used for
input files, as you'll see. Also be sure to copy
your file to <I>/var/smack-data/</I>.</P>

<P class="docList">The format to use when <TT>type</TT> is

"<TT>jzawodn_%07d</TT>" generates values composed of
<TT>jzawodn_</TT> and a seven-digit number.</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">The source is either a filename (assumed to be in the
<I>/var/smack-data</I> directory) or a comma-separated
list of quoted values ("<TT>one","two","three</TT>") when
using a <TT>source_type</TT> of <TT>list</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">If you use a delimited file, the
<TT>delim</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1280"></A>
option tells super-smack which character separates the input fields
in your source file. The <TT>file_size_equiv</TT> option is
helpful when you have a very large dictionary. Rather than use every
word, super-smack divides the file size by this number. The result is
then used to skip records in the input.</P>

<P class="docText">For example, if your file is 100 KB in size and you specify a
<TT>file_size_equiv</TT> of 10,240, super-smack divides the
two and knows to use only one tenth of the input. It will test using
every tenth value in the source file.</P>

<P class="docText">Next are two query definitions, one for a series of
<TT>SELECT</TT> queries followed by an
<TT>UPDATE</TT> query generator:</P>

<PRE>query "select_by_username"
{
  query "select * from http_auth where username = '$word'";
  type "select_index";
  has_result_set "y";
  parsed "y";
}
query "update_by_username"
{
  query "update http_auth set pass='$word' where username = '$word'";
  type "update_index";
  has_result_set "n";
  parsed "y";
}</PRE>

<P class="docText">The queries are relatively simple. If you'd like to
substitute a word from the dictionary in the query, simply use the
<TT>$word</TT> placeholder and be sure to set
<TT>parsed</TT> to <TT>y</TT>; otherwise
super-smack uses your query as is.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>type</TT> is simply a tag or name for this set of
queries. It is reported by name in the final statistics. The
<TT>has_result_set</TT> option tells super-smack whether
the query returns data.</P>

<P class="docText">Next, one more <TT>client</TT> is defined:</P>

<PRE>client "smacker"
{
  user "test";
  pass "";
  host "localhost";
  db "test";
  socket "/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock";
  query_barrel "1 select_by_username 1 update_by_username";
}</PRE>

<P class="docText">Unlike the previous client, this one has a
<TT>query_barrel</TT> associated with it. The query barrel
defines the order and number of queries the client will run during
each iteration. In this case, we've instructed it to
execute one <TT>select_by_username</TT> query followed by
one <TT>update_by_username</TT> query. You can adjust the
numbers to suit your particular testing needs, of course.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, we get to the main section of the <I>smack</I>
file. It controls the actual flow.</P>

<PRE>main
{
  smacker.init( );
  smacker.set_num_rounds($2);
  smacker.create_threads($1);
  smacker.connect( );
  smacker.unload_query_barrel( );
  smacker.collect_threads( );
  smacker.disconnect( );
}</PRE>

<P class="docText">One of the first things to notice is that command-line arguments are
available in shell-style numbered variables (<TT>$1</TT>,
<TT>$2</TT>, etc.). So if you'd like to
reverse the order of arguments on the command line, you can do so.</P>

<P class="docText">The code's flow is straightforward. It begins by
initializing the <TT>smacker</TT> client. Then we set the
number of rounds and create the necessary threads. Each thread then
connects to the server and unloads its barrel of queries, keeping
statistics along the way. The <TT>collect_threads</TT>
function causes the main thread to wait for the others to complete.
The clients then disconnect, and the statistics are reported.</P>

<P class="docText">When you look at the setup piece by piece, it's easy
to digest. The same framework works for a wide variety of testing.
The main section rarely changes. And, for very simple tests (such as
a single query), there's no need to define multiple
users. If you are creating a benchmark to simulate a relatively
complex application that requires various username and password
combinations to access all the necessary data,
you'll need to also define them in your
<I>smack</I> file.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1281"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1282"></A></P>

super-smack is a great tool, but it's not terribly
extensible unless you want to dive into the C++ code. When you need
custom logic that's not easy to express in
super-smack's configuration, it's
probably time to turn to your favorite scripting language.</P>

<P class="docText">When Jeremy encountered this problem in back in 2001, he developed a
very simple Perl-based system called MyBench. It handles the details
of spawning clients, gathering and computing statistics, and so on.
The downside is that it's quite a bit heavier on the
client side. You really shouldn't run the benchmark
client on the same machine as MySQL.</P>

<P class="docText">You can download the code from <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mybench/">http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mybench/</A>. To
use it you'll need <TT>DBI</TT>,
<TT>DBD::mysql</TT>, and <TT>Time::HiRes</TT>
installed. The <TT>MyBench.pm</TT> module contains the
common logic. Creating a simple benchmark is a matter of adding your
logic to the supplied <I>bench_example</I> script.</P>

<P class="docText">As we did with super-smack, let's look through the
<I>bench_example</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1286"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1287"></A> script to understand how it works. The
first few lines simply import the required modules and set up some
simple command-line option handling. It requires two command-line
arguments. The <TT>-n</TT> argument specifies the number of
clients to simulate (children to fork), and <TT>-r</TT>
sets the number of iterations each client will run. The optional
<TT>-h</TT> argument can specify a hostname.</P>

my $dsn       = "DBI:mysql:$db:$host;port=$port";</PRE>

<P class="docText">Of course, you can hardcode the values if you'd
like, or you can make the script more generic by parameterizing the
connection information (<TT>db</TT>,
<TT>user</TT>, <TT>pass</TT>,
<TT>port</TT>, <TT>host</TT>).</P>

<P class="docText">With the setup out of the way, the script sets up a callback
function. It will be called by the code to set up an initial
connection and run the tests.</P>

    my $cnt = 0;
    my @times = ( );

    ## wait for the parent to HUP me
    local $SIG{HUP} = sub { };
    sleep 600;

    while ($cnt &lt; $num_runs)
    {
        my $v = int(rand(100_000));
        ## time the query
        my $t0 = [gettimeofday];
        $sth-&gt;execute($v);
        my $t1 = tv_interval($t0, [gettimeofday]);
        push @times, $t1;

    my @r = ($id, scalar(@times), min(@times), max(@times), avg(@times), 
                         tot(@times));
    return @r;
};</PRE>

<P class="docText">The callback first establishes a connection to the server and
prepares the query that will be executed. Next, it sets a few
variables and then sets a dummy signal handler. It then sleeps,
waiting for a SIGHUP. After the parent has started all the children,
it signals them to start using SIGHUP.</P>

<P class="docText">After the signal has been handled, the main loop starts. In each
iteration, it selects a random value to test, starts a timer,
executes the query, and stops the timer. The resulting time is pushed
to the <TT>@times</TT> list for later use. We finish the
statement to dispose of any returned data and increment the loop
counter.</P>

<P class="docText">After the loop completes, we disconnect from the server and return
the time information back to the caller:</P>

MyBench::compute_results('test', @results);

exit;

<P class="docText">The <TT>fork_and_work(
)</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1288"></A> subroutine from the MyBench
package is what gets everything rolling. The results are then passed
to <TT>compute_results( )</TT> and printed. The first
argument passed is simply a name that will appear in the output to
identify the results.</P>

<P class="docText">Here's a simple run, using a <TT>SELECT
1</TT> query with 10 clients for 100,000 iterations:</P>

  q/sec   : 17822.6756483597</PRE>

<P class="docText">The first three lines are merely status updates so you can tell that
the test is doing something while it runs. The
<TT>test</TT>: line produces all the statistics on a single
line, suitable for processing in another script or pasting into a
spreadsheet. They're followed by human readable
output.</P>

<P class="docText">There you can see how many clients were used, the total number of
queries executed, and the response times (in seconds) of fastest and
slowest queries as well as the average. The <TT>serial</TT>
value explains approximately how many seconds the queries would have
taken if executed serially. Finally, the <TT>q/sec</TT>
number tells us how many queries per second (on average) the server
handled during the test.</P>

<P class="docText">Because the code times only the query and not the work done by the
Perl script, you can add arbitrarily complex logic to the main loop.
Rather than generate a random number, maybe you need to read a value
from a file or from another database table. Perhaps you need to run a
few special queries every 785th iteration, to simulate the behavior
of your real application. Doing so with MyBench would be easy; using
super-smack would be more of a challenge.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1289"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1290"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1291"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-3-ITERM-1292"></A></P>
