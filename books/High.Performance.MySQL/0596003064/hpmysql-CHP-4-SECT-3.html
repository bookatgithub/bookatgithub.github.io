<H3 class="docSection1Title">4.3 Indexes and Table Types</H3>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1343"></A>Now that we have discussed the
common index types, terminology, and uses in relatively generic terms
so far, let's look at the indexes implemented in
each of MySQL's storage engines. Each engine
implements a subset of the three index types we've
looked at. They also provide different optimizations that you should
be aware of.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.3.1 MyISAM Tables</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1344"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1345"></A>MySQL's default table
type provides B-tree indexes, and as of Version 4.1.0, it provides
R-tree indexes for spatial data. In addition to the standard benefits
that come with a good B-tree implementation, MyISAM adds two other
important but relatively unknown features <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1346"></A>prefix compression and
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1347"></A>packed keys.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1348"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1349"></A>Prefix
compression is used to factor out common prefixes in string keys. In
a table that stores URLs, it would be a waste of space for MySQL to
store the "http://" in every node
of the B-tree. Because it is common to large number of the keys, it
will compress the common prefix so that it takes significantly less
space.</P>

<P class="docText">Packed keys are best thought of as prefix compression for integer
keys. Because integer keys are stored with their high bytes first,
it's common for a large group of keys to share a
common prefix because the highest bits of the number change far less
often. To enable packed keys, simply append:</P>

<PRE>PACKED_KEY = 1</PRE>

<P class="docText">to the <I>CREATE</I> <I>TABLE</I> statement.</P>

<P class="docText">MySQL stores the indexes for a table in the table's
<I>.MYI</I> file.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.1.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.3.1.1 Delayed key writes</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1350"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1351"></A>One performance-enhancing feature of
MyISAM tables is the ability to delay the writing of index data to
disk. Normally, MySQL will flush modified key blocks to disk
immediately after making changes to them, but you can override this
behavior on a per-table basis or globally. Doing so provides a
significant performance boost during heavy <TT>INSERT</TT>,
<TT>UPDATE</TT>, and <TT>DELETE</TT> activity.</P>

<P class="docText">MySQL's <TT>delay_key_write</TT> tristate
setting controls this behavior. The default, <TT>ON</TT>,
means that MySQL will honor the <TT>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</TT>
option in <TT>CREATE</TT> <TT>TABLE</TT>. Setting
it to <TT>OFF</TT> means that MySQL will never delay key
writes. And setting it to <TT>ALL</TT> tells MySQL to delay
key writes on all MyISAM tables regardless of the
<TT>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</TT> used when the table was created.</P>

<P class="docText">The downside of delayed key writes is that the indexes may be out of
sync with the data if MySQL crashes and has unwritten data in its key
buffer. A <TT>REPAIR</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1352"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1353"></A> <TT>TABLE</TT>, which
rebuilds all indexes and may consume a lot of time, is necessary to
correct the problem.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.3.2 Heap Tables</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1354"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1355"></A>MySQL's only in-memory
table type was originally built with support just for hash indexes.
As of Version 4.1.0, however, you may choose between B-tree and hash
indexes in Heap tables. The default is still to use a hash index, but
specifying B-tree is simple:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>create table heap_test (</B>
    -&gt; name varchar(50) not null,
    -&gt; index using btree (name)
    -&gt; ) type = HEAP;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)</PRE>

<P class="docText">To verify that the index was created properly, use the <I>SHOW
KEYS</I> command:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>show keys from heap_test \G</B>
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: heap_test
  Non_unique: 1
    Key_name: name
Seq_in_index: 1
 Column_name: name
   Collation: A
 Cardinality: NULL
    Sub_part: NULL
      Packed: NULL
        Null: 
  Index_type: BTREE
     Comment: 
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</PRE>

<P class="docText">By combining the flexibility of B-tree indexes and the raw speed of
an in-memory table, query performance of the temp tables is hard to
beat. Of course, if all you need are fast single-key lookups, the
default hash indexes in Heap tables will serve you well. They are
lightning fast and very space efficient.</P>

<P class="docText">The index data for Heap tables is always stored in memory—just
like the data.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.3.3 BDB Tables</H4>

<P class="docText">MySQL's
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1356"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1357"></A>Berkeley DB
(BDB) tables provide only B-tree indexes. This may come as a surprise
to long-time BDB users who may be familiar with its underlying
hash-based indexes. The indexes are stored in the same file as the
data itself.</P>

<P class="docText">BDB's indexes, like those in MyISAM, also provide
prefix compression. Like InnoDB, BDB also uses clustered indexes, and
BDB tables require a primary key. If you don't
supply one, MySQL creates a hidden primary key it uses internally for
locating rows. The requirement exists because BDB always uses the
primary key to locate rows. Index entries always refer to rows using
the primary key rather than the record's physical
location. This means that record lookups on secondary indexes are
slightly slower then primary-key lookups.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.3.4 InnoDB Tables</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1358"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1359"></A>InnoDB tables provide B-tree indexes.
The indexes provide no packing or prefix compression. In addition,
InnoDB also requires a primary key for each table. As with BDB,
though, if you don't provide a primary key, MySQL
will supply a 64-bit value for you.</P>

<P class="docText">The indexes are stored in the InnoDB tablespace, just like the data
and data dictionary (table definitions, etc.). Furthermore, InnoDB
uses clustered indexes. That is, the primary key's
value directly affects the physical location of the row as well as
its corresponding index node. Because of this, lookups based on
primary key in InnoDB are very fast. Once the index node is found,
the relevant records are likely to already be cached in
InnoDB's buffer pool.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.5"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.3.5 Full-Text Indexes</H4>

<P class="docText">A <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1360"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1361"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1362"></A>full-text index is a special type of
index that can quickly retrieve the locations of every distinct word
in a field. MySQL's provides full-text indexing
support in MyISAM tables. Full-text indexes are built against one or
more text fields (<TT>VARCHAR</TT>,
<TT>TEXT</TT>, etc.) in a table.</P>

<P class="docText">The full-text index is also stored in a table's
<I>.MYI</I> file. It is implemented by creating a
normal two-part MyISAM B-tree index in which the first field is a
<TT>VARCHAR</TT>, and the second is a
<TT>FLOAT</TT>. The first field contains the indexed word,
and the <TT>FLOAT</TT> is its local weight in the row.</P>

<P class="docText">Because they generally contain one record for each word in each
indexed field, full-text indexes can get large rather quickly.
Luckily, MySQL's B-tree indexes are quite efficient,
so space consumed by full-text is well worth the performance boost.</P>

<P class="docText">It's not uncommon for a query like:</P>

<PRE>select * from articles where body = "%database%"</PRE>

<P class="docText">to run thousands of times faster when a full-text index is added and
the query is re-written as:</P>

<PRE>select * from articles (body) match against ('database')</PRE>

<P class="docText">As with all index types, it's a matter of trading
space for speed.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.6"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.3.6 Index Limitations</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1363"></A>There
are many times when MySQL simply can't use an index
to satisfy a query. To help you recognize these limitations (and
hopefully avoid them), let's look at the four main
impediments to using an index.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.6.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.3.6.1 Wildcard matches</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1364"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1365"></A>A query to locate all records that
contain the word "buffy":</P>

<PRE>select * from pages where page_text like "%buffy%"</PRE>

<P class="docText">is bound to be slow. It requires MySQL to scan every row in the
table. And it won't even find all occurrences,
because "buffy" may be followed by
some form of punctuation. The solution, of course, is to build a
full-text index on the <TT>page_text</TT> field and query
using MySQL's <TT>MATCH</TT>
<TT>AGAINST</TT> syntax.</P>

<P class="docText">When you're dealing with partial words, however,
things degenerate quickly. Imagine trying to find the phone number
for everyone whose last name contains the string
"son", such as Johnson, Ansona, or
Bronson. That query would look like this:</P>

<PRE>select phone_number from phone_book where last_name like "%son%"</PRE>

<P class="docText">That seems suspiciously similar to the
"buffy" example, and it is. Because
you are performing a wildcard search on the field, MySQL will need to
read every row, but switching to a full-text index
won't help. Full-text indexes deal with complete
words, so they're of no help in this situation.</P>

<P class="docText">If that's surprising, consider how
you'd attempt to locate all those names in a normal
phone book. Can you think of an efficient approach?
There's really no simple change that can be made to
the printed phone book that will facilitate this type of query.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.6.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.3.6.2 Regular expressions</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1366"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1367"></A>Using a regular expression has
similar problems. Imagine trying to find all last names that end with
either "ith," such as Smith, or
"son" as in Johnson. As any Perl
hacker would tell you, that's easy. Build a regular
expression that looks something like <TT>(son|ith)$</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Translating that into MySQL, you might write this query:</P>

<PRE>select last_name from phone_book where last_name rlike "(son|ith)$"</PRE>

<P class="docText">However, you'd find that it runs slowly, and it does
so for the same reasons that wildcard searches are slow.
There's simply no generalized and efficient way to
build an index that facilitates running arbitrary wildcard or
regular-expression searches.</P>

<P class="docText">In this specific case, you can work around this limitation by storing
reversed last names in a second field. Then you can reverse the sense
of the search and use a query like this:</P>

<PRE>select last_name from phone_book where rev_last_name like "thi%"
union
select last_name from phone_book where rev_last_name like "nos%"</PRE>

<P class="docText">But that's efficient only because
you're starting at the beginning of the string,
which is really the end of the real string before it is reversed.
Again, there's no general solution to this problem.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that a regular expression still isn't efficient
in this case. You might be tempted to write this query:</P>

<PRE>select last_name from phone_book where rev_last_name rlike "^(thi|nos)"</PRE>

<P class="docText">You would be disappointed by its performance. The MySQL optimizer
simply never tries to optimize regex-based queries.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.6.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.3.6.3 Poor statistics or corruption</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1368"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1369"></A>If MySQL's internal
index statistics become corrupted or otherwise incorrect (possibly as
the result of a crash or accidental server shutdown), MySQL may begin
to exhibit very strange behavior. If the statistics are simply wrong,
you may find that it no longer uses an index for your query. Or it
may use an index only some of the time.</P>

<P class="docText">What's likely happened is that MySQL believes that
the number of rows that match your query is so high that it would
actually be more efficient to perform a full table scan. Because
table scans are primarily sequential reads, they're
faster than reading a large percentage of the records using an index,
which requires far more disk seeks.</P>

<P class="docText">If this happens (or you suspect it has), try the index repair and
analysis commands explained in the "Index
Maintenance" section later in this chapter.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-3.6.4"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.3.6.4 Too many matching rows</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1370"></A>Similarly, if a table
actually does have too many rows that really do match your query,
performance can be quite slow. How many rows are too many for MySQL?
It depends. But a good rule of thumb is that when MySQL believes more
than about 30% of the rows are likely matches, it will resort to a
table scan rather than using the index. There are a few exceptions to
this rule. You'll find a more detailed discussion of
this problem in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-5.html#hpmysql-CHP-5">Chapter 5</A>.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1371"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1372"></A></P>
