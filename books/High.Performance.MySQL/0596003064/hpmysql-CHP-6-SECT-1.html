<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1452"></A>Before we can begin to think
about what to adjust on a busy MySQL server, it's
best to get an understanding of the various factors that affect
performance and, most importantly, <span class="docEmphasis">how</span> they can
affect it. One of the single biggest problems that most MySQL users
face is simply not understanding how to go about finding bottlenecks.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-1.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.1.1 Disks</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1453"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1454"></A>The fundamental battle
in a database server is usually between the CPU(s) and available disk
I/O performance; we'll discuss memory momentarily.
The CPU in an average server is orders of magnitude faster than the
hard disks. If you can't get data to the CPU fast
enough, it must sit idle while the disks locate the data and transfer
it to main memory.</P>

<P class="docText">The real problem is that a lot of the disk access is random rather
than sequential: read 2 blocks from here, 10 from there, 4 from
there, and so on. This means that even though your shiny new SCSI
disks are rated at 80 MB/sec throughput, you'll
rarely see values that high. Most of the time you'll
be waiting for the disks to locate the data. The speed at which the
heads move across the platter and fetch another piece of data is
known as <I>seek
time,</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1455"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1456"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1457"></A> and it's often the
governing factor in real-world disk performance.</P>

<P class="docText">The seek time consists of two factors. First is the amount of time
required to move the head from one location to the next. When the
head arrives at the new location, it often needs to wait for the disk
platter to rotate a bit more so that it can read the desired piece of
information. The disk's rotation speed, measured in
RPMs, is the second factor. Generally speaking, the faster the
platters rotate, the lower the disk's seek time will
be. When you're shopping for your database
server's disks, it's usually better
to spend the extra cash for the 15,000-RPM model rather than saving a
bit with the cheaper 10,000-RPM model. As a bonus, higher RPM drives
provide greater transfer rates because they're
reading data from a faster moving platter.</P>

<P class="docText">This all means that the first bottleneck you're
likely to encounter is disk I/O. The disks are clearly the slowest
part of the system. Like the CPU's caches,
MySQL's various buffers and caches use main memory
as a cache for data that's sitting on disk. If your
MySQL server has sufficient disk I/O capacity, and MySQL has been
configured to use the available memory efficiently, you can better
use the CPU's power.</P>

<P class="docText">A common complaint against MySQL is that it can't
handle really large tables. Assuming the people making that statement
have even used MySQL, they likely encountered an I/O bottleneck they
didn't know how to fix. MySQL worked great with a
few hundred megabytes of data, but once loaded up with 60 GB, it
became slow. The conclusion drawn was that MySQL was somehow
inadequate.</P>

<P class="docText">Of course, there are some circumstances in which MySQL can become
CPU-bound rather than I/O-bound: they're simply not
as common. If you often ask MySQL to perform some computation on your
data (math, string comparison, etc.), the CPU will work harder. When
running a <TT>CHECK</TT> <TT>TABLE</TT> command,
you'll likely find the CPU pegged. And, of course,
queries that aren't using indexes really tax it as
well.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-1.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.1.2 Memory</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1458"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1459"></A>To bridge the gap
between blazingly fast CPUs and comparatively slow disks, we have
memory. With respect to performance, it's in the
middle—significantly faster than disks but still much slower
than the CPU. The underlying operating system generally uses free
memory to cache data read from and written to disk. That means if you
frequently query the same small MyISAM table over and over,
there's a very good chance you'll
never touch the disk. Even though MySQL doesn't
cache row data for MyISAM tables (only the index blocks), the entire
MyISAM table is likely in the operating system's
disk cache.</P>

<P class="docText">Modern <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1460"></A>CPUs are even substantially faster than
main memory. To combat this mismatch, chip makers have designed
multilevel caching systems. It's common for a CPU to
contain level 1, level 2, and even level 3 caches. The caches use
significantly faster and more expensive memory, so
they're generally a fraction of the size of main
memory; a 512-KB L2 cache is generous.</P>

<P class="docText">With that in mind, simply adding memory to your server will improve
MySQL performance only if the operating system can make good use of
it by caching even more disk blocks. If your database is 512 MB, and
you already have 1 GB of memory, adding more memory probably
won't help.</P>

<P class="docText">On the other hand, if you run more than just MySQL on the server,
adding memory may help. Maybe that Java application server
you've been running is eating up a lot of the memory
that could otherwise cache disk access. Keep in mind that Linux, like
most modern operating systems, considers caching disk I/O an optional
feature. It doesn't reserve any memory for it. So
when free memory is low, MySQL can really suffer because MyISAM
tables expect the OS to do some read caching.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-1.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">6.1.2.1 MySQL's buffers and caches</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1461"></A>By
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1462"></A>adjusting how much
memory MySQL uses, you can often realize significant performance
improvements. To do that effectively, you first need to understand
how MySQL uses memory. Most of the memory MySQL allocates is used for
various internal buffers and caches. These buffers fall into two
major groups: <I>global
buffers</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1463"></A> and
<I>per-connection</I> buffers. As their name implies,
global buffers are shared among all the connections (or threads) in
MySQL.</P>

<P class="docText">The two most important global buffers are the
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1464"></A>MyISAM key buffer
(<TT>key_buffer_size</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1465"></A>)
and <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1466"></A>InnoDB's buffer pool
(<TT>innodb_buffer_pool_size</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1467"></A>).
The MyISAM key buffer is where MySQL caches frequently used blocks of
index data for MyISAM tables. The less often MySQL needs to hit the
disk to scan a table's index, the faster queries
will be. If possible, consider making the key buffer large enough to
hold the indexes for your most actively used tables—if not all
your tables. By adding up the size of the <I>.MYI</I>
files for the tables, you'll have a good idea how
large to set the buffer.</P>

<P class="docText">MySQL doesn't cache rows for MyISAM
tables—only indexes. InnoDB, on the other hand, caches index
and row data together in its buffer pool. As you'll
recall from <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-4.html#hpmysql-CHP-4">Chapter 4</A>, InnoDB uses clustered
indexes. Because it stores the index and row data together,
it's only natural to cache the index and row data in
memory when possible.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1468"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1469"></A>When you shop for new database
hardware, either with the intention to build yourself or to buy from
a big-name vendor, there are many details to consider.
What's the difference between the $4,000 server sold
by a big name vendor such as IBM, HP, or Dell, and the seemingly
equivalent $2,300 unit that your favorite "white
box" company is selling? There are several, and some
affect MySQL performance. Let's have a look.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1470"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1471"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1472"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1473"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1474"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1475"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1476"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1477"></A><DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Memory speed</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1470"></A>The
CPU can access data faster if it's stored in PC3700
memory than older PC133 memory. Be sure to get the fastest system bus
you can and memory to match. The less time the CPU spends waiting for
data to arrive, the more work it can get done in a given amount of
time. Server-class hardware often uses Error Checking and Correcting
(ECC) memory that can detect flaws in memory that result from aging
and outside factors such as radiation and cosmic rays.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1471"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1472"></A>Frequently accessed memory is cached by

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1473"></A>More
expensive "server class" systems
often have multiple, separate I/O channels rather than a single
shared bus. That means the data moving between main memory and your
disk controller doesn't interfere with the data path
between the CPU and your network card. Again, this means the CPU
spends less time waiting for data to arrive or depart.</P>

<P class="docList">Unfortunately, this difference doesn't show up until
a the system is under a fair amount of stress. If you take a normal
white box system and a server class system and compare them with a
simple benchmark, they may score the same. The white box might even
score higher. But when they are under real-world production loads,
the white box could perform miserably.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1474"></A>Having multiple power supplies
won't make your server any faster. It will, however,
allow the server to keep running if the primary supply dies. Given
the choice between good performance and no performance, choose
wisely. And, if you plug them into different power sources,
you're protected in case a fuse or circuit breaker
dies.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1475"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1476"></A>Hot-swappable RAID disks are a valuable
feature not all servers provide. Not having them means that you can
survive a disk failure, but you'll eventually need
to shut down the machine to swap out the bad disk. The only way
around this is if there's room for a spare disk (or
<I>hot spare</I>) the RAID system can bring online in
the event of a failure. When running a RAID array in
"degraded" mode (missing a disk),
you're either sacrificing performance, redundancy,
or both. You probably don't want to do either one
for very long!</P>
<P class="docList">On a similar note, many name-brand servers provide battery-backed
RAID controllers that ensure unwritten changes do get written to disk
when power is restored. This boosts performance as well, because the
writes can be considered completed when they are written to the
controllers memory, rather than actually waiting for the physical
disk writes to complete. Unfortunately, the caches provided by most
vendors are relatively small.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1477"></A>Server-class hardware typically comes
with better networking options than your run-of-the-mill desktop or
laptop. Specifically you'll either see gigabit
Ethernet or dual Ethernet ports (often 100 Mbit). Having multiple
network ports may be useful when setting up replication, as
you'll see in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A>.</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">It can be very tempting, especially if buying a number of servers for
a cluster, to consider skimping on "the little
things" like how much CPU cache is onboard, or the
speed of the memory, because those little things, over the cost of a
couple hundred machines, can add up. Resist that urge, when you are
building a singer server or replication master. It is one of the few
times that "throwing money at it"
can make your life significantly more pleasant down the road.</P>

<P class="docText">On the other hand, if you want to build the next Google, your goal is
probably to buy the greatest number of inexpensive machines as
possible and to scale by simply adding more of them later on.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.1.3 Network</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1478"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1479"></A>The
performance of your network usually doesn't have
much bearing on MySQL. In most deployments, clients are very near the
servers—often connected to the same switch—so latency is
low, and available bandwidth is quite high. But there are less common
circumstances in which the network can get in the way.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1480"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1481"></A>Duplex mismatch is a common network
configuration problem that often goes unnoticed until load begins to
increase. When it does, by all appearances MySQL is sending results
very slowly to clients. But when you check the server, you find the
CPU is nearly idle, and the disks aren't working
very hard either. For whatever reason, there's a lot
of 100-Mbit Ethernet equipment that has trouble auto-sensing the
proper settings. Be sure your server and switch agree on either half
or full duplex operation.</P>

<P class="docText">Some MySQL deployments use <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1482"></A>Network Attached Storage
(NAS) devices, such as a Network Appliance filer, rather than local
disks for MySQL's data. The idea is that if the
server dies, you can simply swap in a new one without having to worry
about copying data or dealing with synchronization issues. (See <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-8.html#hpmysql-CHP-8">Chapter 8</A> for more on this topic.) While
that's all true, in dealing with a configuration
it's critical that your network be as uncongested as
possible. Ideally, you'll want to have a fast
dedicated network path between your MySQL server and the storage
server. Typically that means installing a second Network Interface
Card (NIC) that is connected to a private network with your storage
server.</P>

<P class="docText">In a <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1483"></A>replication setup consisting of a single
master and many slaves, it's quite possible to
saturate a single network interface on the master with all the
traffic generated by the slaves. This isn't because
of something MySQL does horribly wrong. It's really
just a matter of scale. Imagine that you have 50 slaves replicating
from the master. Under normal circumstances, each slave uses a
relatively small amount of bandwidth—say 100 KB/sec. That adds
up to 5 Mbit/sec of bandwidth required for 50 slaves. If
you're using 100-Mbit Ethernet,
that's not a big deal. But what if your master
begins getting more inserts per second, or large inserts that contain
<TT>BLOB</TT> fields? You may reach the point that each
slave needs 800 KB/sec of bandwidth to keep up with the
master's data stream. At that point,
you're looking at 40 Mbit/sec of data on your
100-MBit network.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1484"></A>At that point you should begin to
worry. One hundred Mbit/sec is the network's
theoretical maximum bandwidth. In reality its capacity is quite a bit
less that. Many network engineers use 50% utilization as a rule of
thumb for capacity planning. Once they consistently see utilization
that high, they begin thinking about how to break up the network to
better isolate the traffic. The trouble is, that
doesn't help much in this case. Because
there's a single master, all slaves must read from
it.</P>

<P class="docText">There are three possible solutions to this problem. First, you can
take a load off the master by introducing a second tier of slaves
that replicate from the master. They, in turn, serve as masters for
the 50 slaves. See <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A> for more
information about multitiered replication architectures.</P>

<P class="docText">Another option is to add a second network card to the master and
split the 50 slaves across multiple switches. Each of the
master's NICs are connected to a different switch.
The problem is that you'd need to remember which
server is on which switch port and adjust the slave configuration
appropriately.</P>

<P class="docText">A final solution is to compress the data stream between the master
and slaves. This assumes that the data isn't already
compressed and that the master has sufficient CPU power to handle
compressing 50 outbound data streams while handling a high rate of
inserts. Given the rate at which CPUs are evolving, this will soon be
feasible. <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A> discusses options for
encrypting and compressing replication.</P>

<P class="docText">Performance can become an issue when your network links have
relatively high latency. This is typically a problem when the client
and server are separated by a great distance or by an inherently
high-latency link, such as dial-up or satellite. Your goal should be
to keep the clients and servers as close (in network sense) to each
other as possible. If you can't do this, consider
setting up slaves that are close to your most distant clients.</P>

<P class="docText">At first glance, this may not seem like a server-performance issue,
but a high-latency or low-bandwidth network can really slow things
down on the server side. When a client performs a large
<TT>SELECT</TT> on a MyISAM table, it obtains a read lock
on the data. Until the <TT>SELECT</TT> completes, the
server won't release the lock and service any
pending write requests for the table. If the client asking for the
data happens to be far away or on a flaky or congested network, it
will take a long time to retrieve the data and release the lock. The
end result is that things get backed up on the server side even
though the server has sufficient CPU and disk I/O to do the
work.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1485"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1486"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1487"></A></P>
