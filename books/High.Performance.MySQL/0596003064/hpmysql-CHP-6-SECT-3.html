<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1514"></A>From an operating system point of view,
there are several things to consider when building a fast MySQL
server. We'll discuss numerous filesystem issues,
swap configuration, and threading performance.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-3.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.3.1 Filesystems</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1515"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1516"></A>The
proliferation of freely available filesystems in the Linux world has
lead to a regular stream of questions about the best filesystem
choice for MySQL on Linux. In a way, it's not all
that different from choosing the right storage engine for your
tables. You need to consider the benefits and drawbacks of each, as
well as your needs. Unlike switching table types, however, you
can't change filesystems on the fly. And without
creating a bit of a maintenance nightmare, you can't
easily use one filesystem for some tables and another for the
remaining ones.</P>

<P class="docText">It's worth pointing out that filesystem performance
is a relatively minor issue most of the time. If switching
filesystems gives you your largest performance gains,
you've done so many other things right, you deserve
a reward.</P>

<P class="docText">This section is admittedly Linux-centric. That's
primarily because Linux is the operating system with the widest
variety of choices, and it's also because Linux
happens to be what the authors are most experienced with.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-3.1.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">6.3.1.1 Journaling</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1517"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1518"></A>The
biggest difference among the filesystems is journaling. Journaling
filesystems maintain a log (or journal) that is never cached. The
journal is similar in concept to a write-ahead transaction log.
Whenever the filesystem is updated, a record describing the
transaction is appended to the log. Another idle thread actually
processes these transactions by writing the new data to the
filesystem and flagging each processed transaction as it is
completed.</P>

<P class="docText">If the machine crashes, the filesystem performs a roll-forward
recovery, much as InnoDB would. Upon reboot, it simply finishes
processing updates from the journal. Incomplete transactions in the
journal are discarded, so the filesystem's internal
consistency is guaranteed. This significantly decreases the
complexity of running a filesystem check, meaning much shorter reboot
times in the event of a crash. Even though InnoDB provides its own
journaling (in the form of a transaction log), using a journaling
filesystem with InnoDB is still worthwhile because of the time saved
during an unexpected reboot.</P>

<P class="docText">Older filesystems such as
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1519"></A>Linux's ext2 and
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1520"></A>Windows FAT16/FAT32
provide no journaling. In the event of an unclean shutdown, they need
to perform consistency checks upon reboot. On Linux, you must wait
for <span class="docEmphasis">fsck</span> to do the job. On Windows,
<I>scandisk</I> is what you end up waiting for. Luckily
Microsoft's NTFS does provide journaling and
it's the standard filesystem on
Microsoft's server operating systems, Windows NT,
2000, and XP. In the Macintosh world, OS X provides a journaling
option for its HFS filesystem. Tru64 and AIX also provide their own
journaling filesystem implementations.</P>

<P class="docText">FreeBSD currently has no journaling filesystems available, but it
does offer an alternative to journaling, known as <I>soft
updates</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1521"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1522"></A>. Developed by BSD hacker
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1523"></A>Kirk
McKusick, soft updates ensure that metadata changes are written to
disk in such an order that the data is always consistent. Doing this
eliminates the need for a separate log and most synchronous disk
operations while boosting performance through aggregated disk
operations. More information is available on Kirk's
web site (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.mckusick.com/softdep/">http://www.mckusick.com/softdep/</A>) and in the
FreeBSD manual pages for <span class="docEmphasis">newfs</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">tunefs</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">Solaris users who need journaling have traditionally purchased a
filesystem product from Veritas, but newer versions of Solaris
provide a journaling filesystem that eliminates the need for
third-party software.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-3.1.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">6.3.1.2 Other features and tweaks</H5>

<P class="docText">Many of the newer filesystems (those designed in the past 10 years or
so) have other important features that affect performance. Their
designers realized that disk sizes were steadily increasing, and
intensive new applications (high-volume databases, streaming video,
etc.) could benefit from rethinking filesystem design. As a result,
we have a good selection of high performance filesystems to choose
from today. See <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-3.1.3">Section 6.3.1.3</A> for more details.</P>

<P class="docText">The two most notable enhancements in these newer filesystems are
support for large directories and better management of fragmentation
and free space. Large directory support means that operations on
directories that contain thousands of files aren't
appreciably slower than operations on smaller directories. This
becomes an issue for MySQL only when you have a MySQL database that
contains a large number of MyISAM tables. Since each table is
composed of three files, the number of files can grow quickly.</P>

<P class="docText">Free-space management and fragmentation affect systems on which there
are lots of MyISAM tables that change frequently (lots of deletes,
inserts, and updates). Some filesystems are smarter than others about
allocating contiguous blocks of disk space for files. This helps to
reduce fragmentation, which means fewer disk seek operations when
operating on the tables.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList">ext3 evolved out of a desire to add journaling support to the ext2
filesystem. You can think of ext3 as simply that—ext2 with
journaling added on. Most of ext2's limitations
(such as poor performance with large directories) still exist in
ext3.</P>
<P class="docList">One interesting byproduct of the ext3 implementation is that you can
actually switch the ext3 journal on and off using
<span class="docEmphasis">tunefs</span><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1527"></A>. With the journal disabled, an ext3

<P class="docText">On <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1532"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1533"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1534"></A>FreeBSD,
there are really only two filesystem types to choose from: UFS and
UFS2. The main difference between them is that UFS2 can handle over 1
TB of data, and it has built-in access control list (ACL) and
extended attribute support. Aside from the size differences, none of
the differences really affect database users. If you have large
directories, the <TT>UFS_DIRHASH</TT> kernel option may
help. It creates in-memory hash tables for large directories, and it
doesn't affect the on-disk layout.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-3.1.5"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">6.3.1.5 Do you need a filesystem at all?</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1535"></A>Traditional high-end database servers
often don't use a filesystem at all. Instead, the
database server bypasses the filesystem interface entirely and
communicates directly with the disks. This raw access method puts the
burden of managing space, fragmentation, and read/write requests on
the database server itself.</P>

<P class="docText">The historical rationale for bypassing the filesystem is that early
operating systems didn't place much emphasis on
filesystem performance. As long as they stored and retrieved data
reliably, most people were happy. Another reason is that volume
managers didn't really exist, so the operating
systems of the day had no good way to combine the
server's whopping 10-MB disks into a single, larger
disk. When databases routinely exceeded the size of a single disk,
vendors had little choice but to implement their own low-level
storage.</P>

<P class="docText">Nowadays, modern disks are orders of magnitude larger, modern servers
provide RAID, and modern operating systems often have volume managers
that make adding more space a trivial operation. Despite these
advances, many DBAs still use raw partitions rather than filesystems.
Users coming from other database systems often ask about
MySQL's ability to use raw disks, expecting it to
boost performance even more. Not to be outdone,
MySQL's InnoDB storage engine can use raw partitions
for its tablespaces.</P>

<P class="docText">To take advantage of this capability, you must leave
InnoDB's home directory unset and specify that the
data-file paths point to raw devices:</P>

<PRE>innodb_data_home_dir=
innodb_data_file_path=/dev/sdb1:18Graw;/dev/sdc1:18Graw</PRE>

<P class="docText">However, you must first initialize the partitions. To do so, use
<TT>newraw</TT> instead of <TT>raw</TT> the first
time and start MySQL. InnoDB will the initialize the partitions.
Watch the MySQL log file for completion, shut down MySQL, change
<TT>newraw</TT> to <TT>raw</TT>, and start MySQL
again.</P>

<P class="docText">From a performance standpoint, tests have shown a very small (2-5%)
performance improvement using raw partitions. When you use raw
partitions, you can no longer use any of your favorite command-line
tools (<span class="docEmphasis">ls</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">du</span>, etc.) to
investigate the storage. Furthermore, backups are more complicated
when using raw disks. Your choice of backup tools is greatly reduced
because most deal with filesystems rather than raw disk
partitions.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1536"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1537"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1538"></A></P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.3.2 Swap</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1539"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1540"></A>In an ideal
world, your server would never swap. Swapping is usually an
indication that you don't have enough memory or that
things are configured improperly—maybe MySQL's
key buffer is too large, or you're starting too many
unused services at boot time. Maybe it's the
operating system itself. Some operating systems make a habit of
swapping when there's still free memory available.</P>

<P class="docText">Some versions of the 2.4
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1541"></A>Linux kernel, for example, are known
for being a bit too aggressive with swapping. Linux has generally
tried to use all available free memory for caching disk access. From
the virtual memory subsystem's point of view, free
memory is wasted memory. Early versions (2.4.0-2.4.9) were okay, as
are later versions (2.4.18 onward). But the middle versions
(2.4.10-2.4.17) were known for being a bit too aggressive. On a
dedicated MySQL server, with a key buffer of 1 GB and 2 GB of total
RAM, it was not uncommon to see Linux swap out parts of the key
buffer while performing a table scan, only to swap it back in moments
later. Needless to say, this had a very negative affect on
performance. The only solution in such a case is to turn off swap
entirely or upgrade to a newer kernel. Luckily, most other operating
systems haven't suffered from this problem. Even
though most systems are well behaved, some MySQL administrators
advocate turning swap off as a preventative measure.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-3.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.3.3 Threading</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1542"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1543"></A>As a
multithreaded server, MySQL is most efficient on an operating system
that has a well implemented threading system. Windows and Solaris are
excellent in this respect. Linux, as usual, is a bit different.
Traditionally, Linux has had a slightly unusual threading
implementation—using cloned processes as threads. It performs
well under most circumstances, but in situations with thousands of
active client connections, it imposes a bit of overhead.</P>

<P class="docText">More recent work on the Linux scheduler and alternative threading
libraries have improved the situation. The <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1544"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1545"></A>Native POSIX Thread Library
(NPTL) is shipped by default in RedHat Linux Version 9.0. Other
distributions have just begun adopting it as well.</P>

<P class="docText">Another popular free operating system,
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1546"></A>FreeBSD,
has threading problems that are much worse. Versions prior to 5.2
provide rather weak native threading. In some circumstances,
I/O-intensive threads are able to get an unfair amount of CPU time,
thus keeping other threads from executing as quickly as they should.
Given the I/O-intensive nature of some database queries, this has a
rather devastating affect on MySQL.</P>

<P class="docText">If upgrading isn't an option, build MySQL from the
FreeBSD ports collection, and be sure to enable support for
LinuxThreads. Doing so causes MySQL to use an alternative threading
that's more like that available in Linux 2.4. Each
thread is actually a process that, thanks to
FreeBSD's <TT>rfork( )</TT> call, has
shared access to MySQL's global buffers. The
overhead of this approach may sound like an issue, but
it's really quite efficient. Many of
Yahoo's hundreds of MySQL servers are using
LinuxThreads on FreeBSD quite effectively.</P>

threads.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-6-ITERM-1547"></A></P>
