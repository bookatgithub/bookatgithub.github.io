<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1607"></A>With
the theory out of the way, let's get our hands on
some servers and configure a master and slave. We'll
cover two scenarios. In the first, we'll assume that
you have a fresh installation of MySQL on the master and slave, with
no data on either server aside from the default
<TT>test</TT> and <TT>mysql</TT> databases.
Later, we'll examine the ways you can configure
replication on a running master with minimal hassle and interruptions
for your users.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.2.1 On a New Server</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1608"></A>Configuring replication on a new server
is a straightforward process. The tasks you need to perform are:</P>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Create a replication account on each server.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Add configuration entries in <I>my.cnf</I> on each
server.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Restart the master and verify the creation of a binary log.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Restart the slave and verify that replication is working.</P></span></LI></OL></span>
<P class="docText">That's it. Four steps.</P>

<P class="docText">For the sake of clarity, we'll use the hostnames
<I>master</I> and <I>slave</I> for our
master and slave, respectively.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.1.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.2.1.1 Account creation</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1609"></A>When the slave connects to the master,
it must authenticate itself just like any other MySQL client, so it
needs a username and password. We'll create an
account named <span class="docEmphasis">repl</span> with a password of
<TT>c0pyIT!</TT> on both the master and slave.</P>

<P class="docText">Why create the account on the slave? Should the master ever fail,
you'll want the slave to become the new master. When
the old master is repaired, it can be put back online as a slave of
the new master (which is the old slave). If the account
didn't exist on the new master, the new slave
wouldn't be able to replicate.</P>

<P class="docText">So, on each server let's create the account and give
it only the minimum privileges necessary for replication:
<TT>REPLICATION</TT> <TT>SLAVE</TT> and
<TT>REPLICATION</TT> <TT>CLIENT</TT>. (In MySQL
3.23 you'd use <TT>USAGE</TT> and
<TT>FILE</TT>.)</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 
repl@"192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0" IDENTIFIED BY 'c0pyIT!';</B>
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)</PRE>

<P class="docText">After creating the account, verify that the settings are correct:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>SHOW GRANTS FOR repl;</B>
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Grants for repl@"192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0"                                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'repl'@'...' IDENTIFIED BY ...|
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</PRE>

<P class="docText">If that command returns no rows or doesn't list the
privileges, double-check that you entered the
<TT>GRANT</TT> command properly.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.2.1.2 Configuration file entries</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1610"></A>The next step is to update the
<I>my.cnf</I> file on each server. You need to tell the
master to enable binary logging and to tell the slave about its
master, login credentials, and so on.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, each server needs to be assigned an ID number, known as a
<I>server ID</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1611"></A>. As you'll see later, the
server ID is recorded in each server's binary log
entries so that any other server can know which server first executed
and logged a query. The server ID can be any number in the range
1-4294967295.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FNOTE-4">[4]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-FNOTE-4">[4]</A></sup> A server ID of 1 is assumed if not
explicitly assigned.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">So, on the master, make sure the following lines are present in the
<TT>[</TT><span class="docEmphasis">mysqld</span><TT>]</TT>
section of the <I>my.cnf</I> file:</P>

<PRE>log-bin
server-id = 1</PRE>

<P class="docText">The <TT>log-bin</TT> option tells MySQL to enable binary
logging. By default, MySQL places the log file in its data directory.
To place the logs elsewhere, you can supply a path and filename:</P>

<PRE>log-bin = /var/db/repl/log-bin</PRE>

<P class="docText">The slave requires a bit more information than the master. Add the
following lines to its <I>my.cnf</I> file:</P>

<PRE>server-id = 2
master-host = master.example.com
master-user = repl
master-password = c0pyIT!
master-port = 3306</PRE>

<P class="docText">The slave's settings are self-explanatory. It just
needs to know how to contact the master and authenticate itself.
Later we'll look at some optional replication
settings that can also appear in <I>my.cnf</I>.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.1.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.2.1.3 Restart master</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1612"></A>With the settings on the master,
it's time to stop and start MySQL and verify that
the binary log appears. No replication-specific method is necessary;
simply stop and restart MySQL using your normal scripts that handle
MySQL when the machine boots and shuts down.</P>

<P class="docText">If you didn't specify a path and filename after
<TT>log-bin</TT> in your <I>my.cnf</I> file,
MySQL writes the log files in your data directory. Otherwise, the
logs are written in the location you specified.</P>

<P class="docText">You should find a binary log file with a <I>.001</I>
extension. By default, the filename will be
<I>hostname-bin</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1613"></A>.
On the host <I>master.example.com</I>, the first log
file will be <I>master-bin.001</I>. If you
haven't run any write queries yet, the file will be
less than 100 bytes in size. Each log file contains a short header
and some meta information.</P>

<P class="docText">If you then execute a few write queries, you should notice the size
of the binary log file increasing. If not, check the error log for
hints about what might have gone wrong.</P>

<P class="docText">You can use the
<I>mysqlbinlog</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1614"></A> utility to examine the data stored in a
binary log file. It reads the entries and prints out the SQL for each
one. It also prints some comments that contain other helpful
information. For example, running it on a fresh log produces output
like this:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqlbinlog master-bin.001</B>
# at 4
#020922 14:59:11 server id 1  log_pos 4        \
 Start: binlog v 3, server v 4.0.4-beta-log created 020922 14:59:11</PRE>

<P class="docText">The first comment indicates that this entry is at offset 4 in the
log. The second comment indicates when the log was created, the
server ID, the log version, and the server version.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.1.4"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.2.1.4 Restart slave</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1615"></A>With the master logging properly, a
simple restart of the slave should be sufficient to get replication
running. When a MySQL server is started, it checks to see whether it
should connect to a master and begin (or continue) replicating
queries. Upon connecting to the master, MySQL logs a message in its
error log to indicate whether the connection succeeded or failed:</P>

<PRE>021103 13:58:10  Slave I/O thread: connected to master 'repl@master:3306',
replication started in log 'log-bin.001' at position 4</PRE>

<P class="docText">This entry indicates that the slave has connected to the master and
begun reading the binary log file <I>master-bin.001</I>
at position (or offset) 4, that of the first query.</P>

<P class="docText">Run some write queries on the master and verify that the data on the
slave reflects those changes. Once the slave is happily replicating
from the master, it can continue to do so indefinitely.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1616"></A></P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.2.2 On an Existing Server</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1617"></A>Setting up replication on a new server
is easy. A few config file entries and a couple of restarts are all
you need. On an existing server, however, there's a
bit more work to do because you can't simply point a
new slave at a master and ask it to clone all the existing
data.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FNOTE-5">[5]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-FNOTE-5">[5]</A></sup> There are plans to fix that in a future version
of MySQL.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">There are a couple of ways to do get the job done.
We'll look at two specific solutions in a moment.
First, let's outline the work that needs to be done;
we'll deal then with common solutions.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.2.2.1 What needs to happen</H5>

<P class="docText">Normally, to enable replication, you have to add binary logging to
your server, which means subsequently restarting the server. If you
happen to have binary logging already enabled, you
don't have to restart the server. As described
earlier, you'll need to add at least two lines to
the server's <I>my.cnf</I> file:</P>

<PRE>log-bin
server-id = 1</PRE>

<P class="docText">Optionally, specify a full path and base filename for the binary logs:</P>

<PRE>log-bin = /var/db/repl/binary-log</PRE>

<P class="docText">The other task involves getting a copy of all the data from the
master and putting it on the new slave. But there's
a twist. The data given to the slave must correspond to the exact
moment in time the binary log begins. Said another way, the binary
log should contain <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> the queries that are
executed on the master after the snapshot was taken and
<span class="docEmphasis">none</span> of the queries from before the snapshot.</P>

<P class="docText">If the binary log contains queries that are already reflected in the
data given to the slave, the slave has no way to know that.
Consequently, it reexecutes the queries, possibly producing strange
errors or otherwise making the data inconsistent with what is on the
master.</P>

<P class="docText">If the binary log misses a few queries that weren't
reflected in the slave's copy of the data, it
won't see those queries. This can cause strange and
hard-to-diagnose problems. Maybe records that were supposed to have
expired are still there, or perhaps there's data on
the master that doesn't appear on the slave.</P>

<P class="docText">Getting the initial data from the master to the slave may be
complicated. If you're using only MyISAM tables and
can afford to shut down the master for enough time to copy all the
data, it will be easy. Otherwise, you'll need to
perform an online copy or dump of the data.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.2.2.2 Snapshot or backup, then copy</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1618"></A>The easiest way to get the
necessary data is to perform a snapshot (online backup) or a more
traditional offline backup and then copy the data to the slave. Using
archive tools such as <I>tar</I> or
<I>zip</I>, or your traditional backup software, shut
down MySQL and copy the contents of the data directory to your slave;
then extract the data on the slave.</P>

<P class="docText">This method works well if you intend to replicate all the data and
can shut down MySQL for the time required to make a copy of the data.
If, however, you can't afford to have MySQL offline
for more than a few seconds, there's an alternative
approach: restart the server once after making the config file
changes and then perform an online snapshot of the data.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1619"></A>A snapshot works well only for MyISAM
tables. InnoDB and BDB tables are best backed up when MySQL
isn't running at all. A snapshot also requires a
read lock on the data for the duration of the snapshot. So
you'll be able to service read requests during the
snapshot process, but all writers will be blocked.</P>

<P class="docText">To perform the actual snapshot, you can write your own script to do
the job, or you can use <span class="docEmphasis">mysqlhotcopy</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlsnapshot</span>. If you roll your own script, you
need to ensure that the <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1620"></A>binary log
is reset before the locks are released. The easiest way to do that is
by executing <TT>FLUSH</TT> <TT>TABLES</TT>
<TT>WITH</TT> <TT>READ</TT>
<TT>LOCK</TT> and then <TT>RESET</TT>
<TT>MASTER</TT> (or <TT>FLUSH</TT>
<TT>MASTER</TT> in versions older than 3.23.26).</P>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-9.html#hpmysql-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A> covers backups as well as the
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlhotcopy</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">mysqlsnapshot</span>
utilities.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.2.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.2.2.3 Online table copies</H5>

<P class="docText">Another approach is to use MySQL's command:</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1621"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1622"></A><PRE> LOAD TABLE mytable FROM MASTER</PRE>

<P class="docText">Doing so instructs a slave to load an entire table from the master.
By writing a relatively simple script, you can instruct the slave to
clone all the tables it needs using a series of those commands.</P>

<P class="docText">The usefulness of this technique is relatively limited, however. Like
the previous option, it requires a master that isn't
being updated. In an environment in which there are frequent updates
to the master, this technique is simply not viable. Furthermore, the
slave copies only the data from the master. It then reconstructs the
indexes locally, for which large amounts of data can take hours or
even days.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-2.2.4"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.2.2.4 Online copy and synchronize (MySQL 4.x only)</H5>

<P class="docText">MySQL 4.0 introduced the <TT>LOAD</TT>
<TT>DATA</TT> <TT>FROM</TT>
<TT>MASTER</TT> command. It combines the previous two
approaches by first obtaining a read lock on all the
master's tables, then loading each table one by one
using the <TT>LOAD</TT> <TT>TABLE</TT>
mechanism.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FNOTE-6">[6]</A></sup> It
respects any slave-side database or table filtering. Once it
completes the loading process, it releases the locks on the master
and begins replicating.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-FNOTE-6">[6]</A></sup> This doesn't include the
tables in the <TT>mysql</TT> database. Put another way,
<TT>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</TT> doesn't
clone users and permissions from the master.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">While this option is very appealing, it suffers from the same
limitations as scripting the <I>LOAD</I>
<I>TABLE</I> command yourself. It is much slower than
using a master snapshot. It also requires that you grant the
<TT>repl</TT> user <TT>SUPER</TT> and
<TT>RELOAD</TT> privileges on the master. Finally, it works
only with MyISAM tables.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1623"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1624"></A></P>
