<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1640"></A>Though
MySQL's replication system is relatively simple
compared to some commercial databases, you can use it to build
arbitrarily complex architectures that solve a variety of problems.
In this section we'll look at some of the more
popular and exotic configurations. We'll also review
how MySQL's replication design makes this possible.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-4.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.4.1 The Replication Rules</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1641"></A>Before
looking at the architectures, it helps to understand the basic rules
that must be followed in any MySQL replication setup:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Every slave must have a unique <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1642"></A>server ID.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A slave may have only one master.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A master may have many slaves.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Slaves can also be masters for other slaves.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">The first rule isn't entirely true, but
let's assume that it is for right now, and soon
enough you'll see why it isn't
always necessary. In any case, the rules aren't
terribly complex. Those four rules provide quite a bit of
flexibility, as the next sections illustrate.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-4.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.4.2 Sample Configurations</H4>

<P class="docText">Building on the four rules, let's begin by
constructing simple replication configurations and discussing the
types of problems they solve. We'll also look at the
types of configurations that don't work because they
violate the second rule. We'll use the simple
configuration as a building block for arbitrarily complex
architectures.</P>

<P class="docText">Each configuration is illustrated in a figure that includes the
server ID of each server as well as its role: master, slave, or
master/slave.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-4.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.4.2.1 Master with slaves</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1643"></A>The most basic replication
model, a single master with one or more slaves, is illustrated in
<A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FIG-1">Figure 7-1</A>. The master is given server ID 1 and
each slave has a different ID.</P>

<P class="docText">This configuration is useful in situations in which you have few
write queries and many reads. Using several slaves, you can
effectively spread the workload among many servers. In fact, each of
the slaves can be running other services, such as Apache. By
following this model, you can scale horizontally with many servers.
The only limit you are likely to hit is bandwidth from the master to
the slaves. If you have 20 slaves, which each need to pull an average
of 500 KB per second, that's a total of 10,000
KB/sec (or nearly 10 Mbits/sec) of bandwidth.</P>

<P class="docText">A 100-Mbit network should have little trouble with that volume, but
if either the rate of updates to the master increases or you
significantly increase the number of slaves, you run the risk of
saturating even a 100-Mbit network. In this case, you need to
consider gigabit network hardware or an alternative replication
architecture, such as the pyramid described later.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.4.2.2 Slave with two masters</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1644"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1645"></A>It would be nice
to use a single slave to handle two unrelated masters, as seen in
<A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</A>. That allows you to minimize hardware
costs and still have a backup server for each master. However,
it's a violation of the second rule: a slave
can't have two masters.</P>

<P class="docText">To get around that limitation, you can run two copies of MySQL on the
slave machine. Each MySQL instance is responsible for replicating a
different master. In fact, there's no reason you
couldn't do this for 5 or 10 distinct MySQL masters.
As long as the slave has sufficient disk space, I/O, and CPU power to
keep up with all the masters, you shouldn't have any
problems.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.4.2.3 Dual master</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1646"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1647"></A>Another possibility is to
have a pair of masters, as pictured in <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FIG-3">Figure 7-3</A>.
This is particularly useful when two geographically separate parts of
an organization need write access to the same shared database. Using
a dual-master design means that neither site has to endure the
latency associated with a WAN connection.</P>

<IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="57" SRC="images/0596003064/figs/hpsql_0703.gif" ALT="figs/hpsql_0703.gif"></CENTER>

<P class="docText">Furthermore, WAN connections are more likely to have brief
interruptions or outages. When they occur, neither site will be
without access to their data, and when the connection returns to
normal, both masters will catch up from each other.</P>

<P class="docText">Of course, there are drawbacks to this setup. <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-7.3">Section 7.7.3</A>, later in this chapter,
discusses some of the problems associated with a multi-master setup.
However, if responsibility for your data is relatively well
partitioned (site A writes only to customer records, and site B
writes only to contract records) you may not have much to worry
about.</P>

<P class="docText">A logical extension to the dual-master configuration is to add one or
more slaves to each master, as pictured in <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FIG-4">Figure 7-4</A>. This has the same benefits and drawbacks of a
dual-master arrangement, but it also inherits the master/slave
benefits at each site. With a slave available, there is no single
point of failure. The slaves can be used to offload read-intensive
queries that don't require the absolutely latest
data.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1648"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1649"></A>The dual-master
configuration is really just a special case of the master ring
configuration, shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FIG-5">Figure 7-5</A>. In a master
ring, there are three or more masters that form a ring. Each server
is a slave of one of its neighbors and a master to the other.</P>

<P class="docText">The benefits of a replication ring are, like a dual-master setup,
geographical. Each site has a master so it can update the database
without incurring high network latencies. However, this convenience
comes at a high price. Master rings are fragile; if a single master
is unavailable for any reason, the ring is broken. Queries will flow
around the ring only until they reach the break. Full service
can't be restored until all nodes are online.</P>

<P class="docText">To mitigate the risk of a single node crashing and interrupting
service to the ring, you can add one or more slaves at each site, as
shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FIG-6">Figure 7-6</A>. But this does little to guard
against a loss of connectivity.</P>

organizations, there may be a single master that must be replicated
to many smaller offices. Rather than configure each slave to contact
the master directly, it may be more manageable to use a pyramid
design as illustrated in <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FIG-7">Figure 7-7</A>.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.4.2.6 Design your own</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1652"></A>There's really
no limit to the size or complexity of the architectures you can
design with MySQL replication. You're far more
likely to run into practical limitations such as network bandwidth,
management and configuration hassles, etc. Using the simple patterns
presented here, you should be able to design a system that meets your
needs. And that's what all this really comes down
to: if you need to replicate your data to various locations,
there's a good chance you can design a good solution
using MySQL.</P>

<P class="docText">You can often combine aspects of the architectures
we've looked at. In reality, however, the vast
majority of needs are handled with less complicated architectures. As
load and traffic grows, the number of servers may increase, but the
ways in which they are organized generally doesn't.
