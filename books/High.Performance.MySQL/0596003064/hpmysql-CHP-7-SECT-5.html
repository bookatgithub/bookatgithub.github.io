rough idea of how up to date a slave is. The trouble with relying on
that information is that you're only looking at
bytes. You can determine how many more bytes of log data the slave
needs to execute before it is current. However, that
doesn't tell you how many queries need to be
executed. There's no good way to figure that out,
short of running the binary log through
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlbinlog</span> and counting queries.</P>

<P class="docText">It is possible to determine how out of date the slave is with some
degree of accuracy by implementing a simple heartbeat system. The
heartbeat principle is easy. At a fixed interval, say 20 seconds, a
process on the master inserts a record with the latest timestamp into
a table. On the slave, a corresponding process reads the most recent
record every 20 seconds. Assuming that the system clocks on both
machines are in sync, you can tell how far behind the slave is to
within 20 seconds of accuracy.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.5.3 Changing Masters</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1665"></A>Sooner or later
you'll need to point your slaves at a new master.
Maybe the old one is being replaced with a newer, faster computer;
perhaps there was a failure, and you are promoting a slave to master.
In MySQL 3.23 and 4.0, you need to inform the slaves about their new
master. A future version of MySQL is supposed to include a fail-safe
replication feature that automates the process.</P>

<P class="docText">A planned changing of masters is a straightforward process. (In the
event of a master failure, it may not be so easy.) You simply need to
issue the <TT>CHANGE</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1666"></A> <TT>MASTER</TT>
<TT>TO</TT> <TT>.</TT>.. command on each slave.
In doing so, you inform the slave of the new
master's parameters—the same ones specified in
the <I>my.cnf</I> file. The slave will begin
replicating from its new master, and MySQL will also update the
<I>master.info</I> with the new information.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-5.3.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.5.3.1 Using the right values</H5>

<P class="docText">As usual, the devil is in the details. How do you decide which values
to use? What if you get them wrong?</P>

<P class="docText">First, let's consider the easy case. If you are in
control of the situation, the process is easy. Follow these steps:</P>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Disconnect all clients (not slaves) from the master.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Make sure the new master is completely caught up.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Execute <TT>RESET MASTER</TT> on the new master.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Make sure each slave is caught up.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Shut down the old master.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Let all clients connect to the new master.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Issue a <TT>CHANGE</TT> <TT>MASTER</TT>
<TT>TO</TT> <TT>.</TT>.. command on each slave,
pointing it to the new master.</P></span></LI></OL></span>
<P class="docText">The <TT>RESET</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1667"></A> <TT>MASTER</TT> command tells
the master to flush all its binary logs and start fresh. By starting
with a clean slate on the new master, there's no
guesswork involved in determining the right log position. Since
it's a brand new log, we know the position is 4,
because each binary log has a 4-byte header that consumes positions
0-3.</P>

<P class="docText">The complete <TT>CHANGE</TT> <TT>MASTER</TT>
<TT>TO</TT> <TT>.</TT>.. command looks like this:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>CHANGE MASTER TO</B>
    -&gt; <B>MASTER_HOST='newmaster.example.com',</B>
    -&gt; <B>MASTER_USER='repl',</B>
    -&gt; <B>MASTER_PASSWORD='MySecret!',</B>
    -&gt; <B>MASTER_PORT=3306,</B>
    -&gt; <B>MASTER_LOG_FILE='log-bin.001',</B>
    -&gt; <B>MASTER_LOG_POS=4;</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">If, on the other hand, the master crashes and you
can't bring it back online in a reasonable amount of
time, things aren't so clear-cut. If you have only
one slave, of course, there's no decision to make.
You use the slave. But if you have multiple slaves, you need to
determine which one is the most up to date.</P>

<P class="docText">By examining the output of <TT>SHOW</TT>
<TT>SLAVE</TT> <TT>STATUS</TT> on each slave, you
can easily determine which one is closest to matching the master at
the time it crashed. Once you know the log name and position, you can
construct a <TT>CHANGE</TT> <TT>MASTER</TT>
<TT>TO</TT> <TT>.</TT>.. command to run on the
remaining slaves.</P>

<P class="docText">In doing so, however, you'll likely cause some the
slaves to be slightly out of sync with their new master. To
illustrate why, assume that each query is assigned an increasing
unique ID number. The original master had just executed query 500
when it crashed. The "most
up-to-date" slave, the new master, had executed
query 496. That means that your best slave is missing four queries,
and there's no way to recover them unless your
application logs every query it writes, which is unlikely.</P>

<P class="docText">Now, let's assume that there are two more slaves,
<span class="docEmphasis">slave2</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">slave3</span>;
<span class="docEmphasis">slave2</span> executed query 490, and
<span class="docEmphasis">slave3</span> executed query 493. You have a choice.
You can either point both slaves at the new master's
current position (query 496) or you can try to figure the
corresponding offsets for each slave in the new
master's binary log. That will take more time, but
it means you lose less data.</P>

<P class="docText">To find the matching log position for each slave, you need to have
the binary log enabled on each slave. Use the
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlbinlog</span> command (described in <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-5.4">Section 7.5.4</A>) to locate the last
query executed. Then locate exactly the same query in the new
master's binary log. Once you find the query,
you'll have the offset you need. The output of
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlbinlog</span> always includes the offset in a
comment right before the query. For example:</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1676"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1677"></A>To make log rotation easier, you can use
something like the following <I>purge_binary_logs</I>
Perl script. It connects to the specified server and checks to see
how many binary logs are sitting around. If there are more than the
specified threshold, it removes any extras.</P>

<PRE>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

## On a slave server, purge the replication logs if there are too many
## sitting around sucking up disk space.

use DBIx::DWIW;

<P class="docText">Depending on your needs, there's a lot of room for
improvement in this script. It would be nice if the script took
command-line arguments so you wouldn't need to
hardcode the hostname, password, and so on. It would also be nice if
the script could check the sizes of the log files. If a master is
restarted very frequently, using the number of log files as a metric
probably isn't as useful as checking the volume of
log data. However, the script can't be run remotely
if it checked log file sizes, because it needs to examine the files
directly.</P>

<P class="docText">A valuable but difficult addition would be for the script to remove
logs only if it can tell that all slaves had already read them. That
requires knowing all the slaves and contacting each one to verify its
progress in the replication process.</P>
