<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1686"></A>Breaking MySQL's
replication isn't difficult. The same simple
implementation that makes it easy to set up also means there are many
ways to stop, confuse, and otherwise disrupt it. In this section,
we'll look at common problems, how they manifest
themselves, and what can be done to solve or even prevent them.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-6.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.1 Slave Data Changes</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1687"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1688"></A>It should go without saying that
manually changing data on a slave is usually a very bad idea. The
same holds true for programmatically changing slave data. By
accidentally making changes to data on a slave, you can easily
introduce data inconsistencies that may cause replication to fail. It
may take hours, days, weeks, or even months for the problem to
surface, and when it does, you'll be hard pressed to
explain what's going on.</P>

<P class="docText">Before MySQL 4.0.14 there was no way to tell MySQL not to allow any
changes that don't originate from replication.
Instead, the best solution in versions prior to 4.0.14 has an ironic
aspect to it: you need to make a change on all the slaves, removing
the permissions (or even the accounts) of users who can change data.</P>

<P class="docText">But that solution is problematic for other reasons.
You'd probably forget about the change after a
while. Then, late one night, the master would fail and you would need
to promote a slave to master. You'd have to spend a
bit of time trying figure out why applications are mysteriously
failing.</P>

<P class="docText">As of Version 4.0.14, adding <TT>read-only</TT> to the
slave's configuration file allows the slave to
process write queries only via replication.</P>

<P class="docText">It's worth remembering that MySQL is very trusting
when it comes to replication. The slave threads
don't switch identities to run each query as the
same user that originally executed it on the master. Instead, the
slave thread runs with the equivalent of root access on the slave. It
can, by design, change any data it needs to change. The trust comes
from the fact that the slaves never verify that a particular user has
the necessary privileges to run a query that appears in the binary
log. It blindly trusts the master and that the
master's logs haven't been tampered
with.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-6.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.2 Nonunique Server IDs</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1689"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1690"></A>This has to be one of the most elusive
problems you can encounter with MySQL replication. If you
accidentally configure two slaves with the same server ID
they'll appear to work just fine if
you're not watching closely. But if you watch their
error logs carefully or watch the master with
<span class="docEmphasis">mytop</span> (covered in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-APP-B.html#hpmysql-APP-B">Appendix B</A>), you'll notice something
very odd.</P>

<P class="docText">On the master, you'll see only one of the two slaves
connected at a given moment. Usually all slaves are connecting and
replicating all the time. On the slave you'll see
frequent disconnect/reconnect messages appearing in the error log,
but none of those messages will lead you to believe that the server
ID of one slave might be misconfigured.</P>

<P class="docText">The only real harm in this situation is that the slaves
can't replicate very quickly. Because the slaves
(not the master) keep track of their replication progress,
there's no need to worry about giving one query to
the first slave, one to the other slave, and so on. Both slaves get
all the data; they just get it much more slowly.</P>

<P class="docText">The only solution to this problem is to be careful when setting up
your slaves. If you see symptoms like this, double check the
configuration of each slave to ensure that it has the server ID you
expect it to. You may find it helpful to keep a master list of
slave-to-server-ID mappings so that you don't lose
track of which ID belongs to each slave. Consider using numeric
values that have some sort of meaning in your setup, such as the last
octet of each machine's IP address.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-6.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.3 Log Corruption or Partial Log Record</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1691"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1692"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1693"></A>The second most elusive problem
occurs when a binary log somehow becomes corrupted. When that
happens, the slave will typically fail with an error message like:</P>

<PRE>Error in Log_event::read_log_event( ): '...', data_len=92,event_type=2</PRE>

<P class="docText">If that ever happens, there's little you can do. The
slave is often confused enough that you can't simply
try to skip the query and go to the next one. The only solution is to
resync with the master and start over.</P>

<P class="docText">How does this happen? It's difficult to say. As long
as the software is working properly, it could be a hardware or driver
problem. Jeremy once saw a system have this problem repeatedly before
he found that it had faulty RAM installed. We have heard of it
happening on systems with disk controllers that
don't have reliable drivers.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-6.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.4 Bulk-Loading Data</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1694"></A>While you can write code to load a lot of
data into MySQL quickly, nothing beats the performance of using
MySQL's <TT>LOAD</TT>
<TT>DATA</TT> <TT>INFILE</TT> and
<TT>LOAD</TT> <TT>DATA</TT>
<TT>LOCAL</TT> <TT>INFILE</TT> commands to read
data in from a flat file. In fact, the <span class="docEmphasis">mysqlimport</span>
command-line tool uses <TT>LOAD</TT>
<TT>DATA</TT> <TT>INFILE</TT> behind the scenes.</P>

<P class="docText">In all 3.23.xx versions of MySQL, replicating the
<TT>LOAD</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1695"></A> <TT>DATA</TT>
<TT>INFILE</TT> command is problematic. The contents of the
file aren't stored in the binary log; only the query
is, so the file must exist on the master until all slaves have copied
it (they will do so automatically when they need it). If the file is
removed prematurely, slaves can't copy the file, and
replication will fail.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>LOAD</TT> <TT>DATA</TT>
<TT>LOCAL</TT> <TT>INFILE</TT> command
isn't affected. When the <TT>LOCAL</TT>
option is specified, the <span class="docEmphasis">mysql</span> client reads the
file from the client and generates the appropriate SQL to insert the
data.</P>

<P class="docText">To avoid this problem, it's best either to load the
data remotely using the latter syntax or to import the data
programmatically. Either option ensures that the inserting is done
via normal SQL statements that will all be properly logged.</P>

<P class="docText">Starting with Version 4.0, MySQL doesn't have this
limitation. When a <TT>LOAD DATA</TT>
<TT>INFILE</TT> command is issued, MySQL actually copies
the entire file into the binary log. Slaves don't
need to pull a copy of the original file from the
master's disk.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-6.5"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.5 Nonreplicated Dependencies</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1696"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1697"></A>If you perform binary log
filtering on either the master or the slave, it's
quite easy to inadvertently break replication. For example, you may
want to have a production database called
<TT>production</TT> and a staging database called
<TT>staging</TT>. The idea is to do all the necessary
testing, development, and retesting in the staging database. When all
the interim work is complete, you copy the data into the production
database.</P>

<P class="docText">If the slave ignores queries from the staging database because of a
filtering rule like the following, you'll probably
end up frustrated:</P>

<PRE>replicate-do-db = production</PRE>

<P class="docText">You might try to run a query like this one to populate one of the
production tables:</P>

<PRE>INSERT INTO production.sales SELECT * FROM staging.sales</PRE>

<P class="docText">This query works fine on the master, but the slaves will all fail
because they don't have copies of the staging
database. In fact, there's no easy way to make it
work. Any attempt to reference the staging database is doomed to
fail.</P>

<P class="docText">The only real solution in a case like this is to export all the data
from the staging database and import it into the production database.
You can do this programmatically if you want fine control over the
process, or you can simply use <I>mysqldump</I> to dump
the data to a text file and reimport it using
<span class="docEmphasis">mysql</span>.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-6.6"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.6 Missing Temporary Tables</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1698"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1699"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1700"></A>This is really a special case of the
previous example, but it warrants special attention because the real
cause is a bit different. Instead of a filtering problem, this is a
problem of restarting the slave at the wrong time.</P>

<P class="docText">Temporary tables replicate just fine, but if a series of queries that
create and use a temporary table are interrupted on a slave by a
restart or by stopping and starting replication, replication will
fail.</P>

<P class="docText">Temporary tables are, by definition, temporary. When the server is
restarted, they vanish. When the thread vanishes (such as with a
<TT>SLAVE</TT> <TT>STOP</TT> or
<TT>SLAVE</TT> <TT>STOP</TT>
<TT>SQL_THREAD</TT> command), any temporary tables created
by that thread vanish.</P>

<P class="docText">There is no good solution for this problem. On the application side,
it's best if temporary tables are created as late as
possible, which helps minimize the time between the creation of the
table and when it is actually needed. But even this solution only
decreases the likelihood of the problem occurring.</P>

<P class="docText">You can avoid temporary tables completely, but that may involve
time-consuming application changes. You'd have to
ensure that the nontemporary tables created by your application
always have unique names and that they are dropped when appropriate.</P>

<P class="docText">Because they are transient, this problem also affects Heap tables.
They are always dropped explicitly, however so they vanish only when
a slave is restarted. Stopping and restarting replication on the
slave doesn't affect Heap tables.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-6.7"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.7 Binary Log Out of Sync with Transaction Log</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1701"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1702"></A>We know that MySQL records queries in the
binary log after it executes them. We also know that MySQL writes
transactions to the binary log after they have been committed. What
happens if MySQL crashes, or someone pulls the plug in the
microseconds after a transaction has been committed but before it
writes the transaction to the binary log?</P>

<P class="docText">The result is that the master will contain the results of having
completed the transaction, but the slaves will never see it. Ever.
The transaction may have been a simple insert, or it could have been
something as dramatic as a <TT>DROP</TT>
<TT>TABLE</TT> command.</P>

<P class="docText">There is currently no workaround for this problem. Luckily MySQL
crashes are rare. Make sure the power cables are plugged in tightly!</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-6.8"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.8 Slave Wants to Connect to the Wrong Master</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1703"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1704"></A>If you change the hostname of your master,
it's important to tell slaves using the
<TT>CHANGE</TT> <TT>MASTER</TT> command:</P>

<PRE>mysql&gt; <B>CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='newmaster.example.com';</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">You can't simply shut down the slave, edit the
<I>my.cnf</I> file, and start it back up. MySQL always
uses the <I>master.info</I> file if it exists, despite
the settings contained in the <I>my.cnf</I>
file.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-7-FNOTE-8">[8]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-FNOTE-8">[8]</A></sup> This is, in my opinion, an easy-to-fix bug, but
the MySQL maintainers don't agree. The workaround is
to always use the <TT>CHANGE MASTER TO</TT> command for
configuring slaves.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Alternatively, you can manually edit the
<I>master.info</I> file, replacing the old hostname
with the new one. The danger in relying on this method is that the
<I>master.info</I> file can be deprecated, replaced, or
radically changed in a future version of MySQL. It's
best to stick to the documented way of doing things.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-7-ITERM-1705"></A></P>
