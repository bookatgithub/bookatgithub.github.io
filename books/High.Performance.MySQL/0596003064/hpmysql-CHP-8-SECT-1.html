<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1713"></A>The
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1714"></A>basic
idea behind load balancing is quite simple. You have a farm or
cluster of two or more servers, and you'd like them
to share the workload as evenly as possible. In addition to the
backend servers, a load balancer (often a specialized piece of
hardware) handles the work of routing incoming connections to the
least busy of the available servers. <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-8-FIG-1">Figure 8-1</A>
shows a typical load-balancing implementation for a large web site.
Note that one load balancer is used for HTTP traffic and another for
MySQL traffic.</P>

<P class="docText">There are four common goals or objectives in load balancing:</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1715"></A>In
an ideal configuration, increasing capacity is as simple as adding
more servers to the farm. By doing this properly, you can achieve
linear scalability (for read-intensive applications) with relatively
inexpensive equipment and guarantee good performance for your
clients. Of course, not all applications scale this way, and those
that do may require a more complex setup. We discuss those later in
this chapter.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1716"></A>Load
balancing helps to use server resources more efficiently because you
get a fair amount of control over how requests are routed. This is
particularly important when your cluster is composed of machines that
aren't equally powerful. You can ensure that the
less powerful machines aren't asked to do more than
their fair share of the work.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1717"></A>With
a cluster of MySQL slaves in place, the loss of any one server
doesn't need to affect clients. They all have
identical copies of the data, so the remaining servers can shoulder
the increased load. This level of redundancy is similar to using RAID
1 across multiple hard disks.</P>

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1718"></A>Transparency
means that clients don't need to know about the
load-balancing setup. They shouldn't care how many
machines are in your cluster or what their names are. As far as
they're concerned, there's one big
virtual server that handles their requests.</P>

interested in a hardware solution for load balancing, you might
consider a language-specific load-balancing API. In the Java world,
for example, Clustered JDBC (<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1720"></A>C-JDBC) provides a transparent layer on
top of JDBC that handles load-balancing SELECT queries behind the
scenes. For more information, see the C-JDBC web site (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://c-jdbc.objectweb.org/)">http://c-jdbc.objectweb.org/)</A> Some Java

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1723"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1724"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1725"></A>If you're
already familiar with HTTP load balancing, you may be tempted to run
ahead and set up something similar for MySQL. After all, MySQL is
just another TCP-based network service that happens to run on port
3306 rather that port 80, right? While that's true,
there are some important differences between HTTP and
MySQL's protocol as well as differences between the
ways that database servers and web servers tend to be used.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-SECT-1.1.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.1.1.1 Requests</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1726"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1727"></A>To begin
with, the connect-request-response cycle for MySQL is different. Most
web servers and web application servers accept all connections,
process a request, respond, and then disconnect almost
immediately.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-8-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup>
They don't perform any fancy authentication. In
fact, most don't even bother with a reverse lookup
of an inbound IP address. In other words, the process of establishing
the connection is very lightweight.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> With the increased adoption of HTTP/1.1,
the disconnect may not occur right away, but the delay is still quite
short in comparison to a typical MySQL server.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">The actual request and response process is typically lightweight too.
In many cases, the request is for a static HTML file or an image. In
that case, the web server simply reads the file from disk, responds
to the client with the data, and logs the request. If the content is
dynamic, the PHP, Java, or Perl code that generates it is likely to
execute very quickly. The real bottlenecks tend to be the result of
waiting on other backend services, such as MySQL or an LDAP server.
Sure, there can be poorly designed algorithms that cause the code to
execute more slowly, but the bulk of web-based applications tend to
have relatively thin business-logic layers. They also tend to push
nearly all the data storage and retrieval off to MySQL.</P>

<P class="docText">Even when there are major differences from request to request, the
differences tend to be in the amount of code executed. But
that's exactly where you want the extra work to be
done. The CPU is far and away the fastest part of the computer. Said
another way, when you're dealing with HTTP, all
requests are created equal—at least compared to a database
server.</P>

<P class="docText">As you saw early on in this book, the biggest bottleneck on a
database server usually isn't CPU;
it's the disk. Disk I/O is an order of magnitude
slower than the CPU, so even occasionally waiting for disk I/O can
make a huge difference in performance. A query that uses an index
that happens to be cached in memory may take 0.08 seconds to run,
while a slightly different query that requires more disk I/O may take
3 seconds to complete.</P>

<P class="docText">On the database side, not all requests are created equal. Some are
far more expensive than others, and the load balancer has no way of
knowing which ones are expensive. That means that the load balancer
may not be <span class="docEmphasis">balancing</span> the load as much as it is
crudely <span class="docEmphasis">distributing</span> the load.</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-SECT-1.1.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.1.1.2 Partitioning</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1728"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1729"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1730"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1731"></A>Another
feature that's common in load-balanced web
application architectures is a caching system. When users first visit
a web site, the web server may assign a session ID to the user, then
pull quite a bit of information from a database to construct the
user's preferences and profile. Since that can be an
expensive operation to perform on every request, the application code
caches the data locally on the web server—either on disk or in
memory—and reuse it for subsequent visits until the cache
expires.</P>

<P class="docText">To take advantage of the locally cached data, the load balancer is
configured to inspect that user's session ID
(visible either in the URL or in a site-wide cookie) and use it to
decide which backend web server should handle the request. In this
way, the load balancer works to send the same user to the same
backend server, minimizing the number of times the
user's profile must be looked up and cached. Of
course, if the server goes offline, the load balancer will select an
alternative server for the user.</P>

<P class="docText">Such a partitioning system eliminates the redundant caching that
occurs if the load balancer sent each request to a random backend
server each time. Rather than having an effective cache size equal to
that of a single server, you end up with an effective cache size
equal to the sum of all the backend servers.</P>

<P class="docText">MySQL's query cache can benefit from such a scheme.
If you've dedicated 512 MB of memory on each slave
for its query cache, and you have 8 slaves, you can cache up to 4 GB
of different data across the cluster. Unfortunately,
it's not that easy. MySQL's network
protocol doesn't have a way to expose any hints to
the load balancer. There are no URL parameters or cookies in which to
store a session ID.</P>

<P class="docText">A solution to this problem is to handle the partitioning of queries
at the application level. You can split the 8 servers into 4 clusters
of 2 servers each. Then you'd decide, in your
application, whether a given query should go to cluster 1, 2, 3, or
4. You'll see more of this shortly.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.1.1.3 Connection pooling</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1732"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1733"></A>Many applications use
connection-pooling techniques; these techniques seem especially
popular in the Java world and in PHP using persistent connections via
<span class="docEmphasis">mysql_pconnect</span><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1734"></A><TT>( )</TT>. While connection
pooling works rather well under normal conditions, it
doesn't always scale well under load because it
breaks one of the basic assumptions behind load balancing. With
connection pooling, each client maintains a fixed or variable number
of connections to one or more database servers. Rather than
disconnecting and discarding the connection when a session is
complete, the connection is placed back into a share pool so that it
can be reused later.</P>

<P class="docText">Load balancing works best when clients connect and disconnect
frequently. That gives the load balancer the best chance of spreading
the load evenly; otherwise the transparency is lost. Imagine you have
a group of 16 web servers and 4 MySQL servers. Your web site becomes
very busy, and the MySQL servers begin to get bogged down, so you add
2 more servers to the cluster. But your application uses connection
pooling, so the requests continue to go to the 4 overworked servers
while the 2 new ones sit idle.</P>

<P class="docText">In effect, connection pooling (or persistent connections) work
against load balancing. It's possible to compromise
between the two if you have a connection-pooling system that allows
the size of the pool to change as the demand increases and decreases.
Also, by setting timeouts relatively low (say, five minutes instead
of six hours), you can still achieve a level of load balancing while
taking advantage of persistent database connections.</P>

<P class="docText">You can also enforce this on the MySQL side by setting each
server's <TT>wait_timeout</TT> to a
relatively low number. (This value tells MySQL how long a connection
may remain idle before it is disconnected.) Doing so encourages
sessions to be reestablished when needed, but the negative affects on
the application side are minimal. Most MySQL APIs allow for automatic
reconnection to the server any time you attempt to reuse a closed
connection. If you make this change, consider also adjusting the
<TT>thread_cache</TT> as described in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-4.html#hpmysql-CHP-6-SECT-4.4">Section 6.4.4</A> in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-6.html#hpmysql-CHP-6">Chapter 6</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">We don't mean to paint connection pooling in a
negative light. It certainly has its uses. Every worthwhile Java
application server provides some form of connection pooling. As
mentioned earlier, some provide their own load-balancing or
clustering mechanisms as well. In such systems, connection pooling
<span class="docEmphasis">combined with</span> load balancing is a fine solution
because there's a single authority mediating the
traffic to the database servers. In the PHP and
<span class="docEmphasis">mysql_pconnect</span><I>( )</I> world,
there often is not.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1735"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1736"></A>While the main focus of this
chapter is on the load balancing of MySQL slaves,
it's entirely possible to use a load balancer to
spread the workload among several masters. Assuming you followed the
advice in the<A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7-SECT-7.3">Section 7.7.3</A>
of <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A>, there's little
difference in the setup required.</P>

<P class="docText">There are different reasons for using slaves and for using multiple
masters. When you use multiple masters, you'll still
get transparency and redundancy; however, scalability and efficiency
don't really apply because in a multi-master setup,
every master must still execute every write query sooner or later.</P>

<P class="docText">By having several masters behind a load balancer, you can better
handle brief surges in traffic that can otherwise overwhelm a single
server. During that time, each master fall farther and farther behind
on the updates it receives from the other(s), but when the traffic
returns to a normal level, the masters will catch up with each other
and return to a state of equilibrium.</P>

<P class="docText">It's very important to realize that this model
doesn't work well for all applications. In this type
of setup, there is no "one true
source" of definitely correct information. That can
cause subtle "bugs" in your
application(s); for example, if you need to know if a record exists,
you need to ask both servers.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1737"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1738"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1739"></A></P>
