<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1755"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1756"></A>As noted earlier, <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-8-SECT-1.html#hpmysql-CHP-8-FIG-1">Figure 8-1</A> is a common setup for many web sites. While
that architecture provides a good starting point, the time may come
when you want to squeeze more performance out of your replication
setup. Partitioning is often the next evolutionary step as the system
grows. In this section, we'll look at several
related partitioning schemes that can be applied to most
load-balanced MySQL clusters.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-SECT-3.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.3.1 Role-Based Partitioning</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1757"></A>Many applications using a MySQL
backend do so in different roles. Let's consider a
large community web site for which users register and then exchange
messages and participate in discussions online. From the data storage
angle, several features must be implemented for the site to function.
For example, the system must store and retrieve records for
individual users (their profiles) as well as messages and
message-related metadata.</P>

<P class="docText">At some point, you decide to add a search capability to the site.
Over the past year, you've accumulated a ton of
interesting data, and your users want to search it. So you add
full-text indexes to the content and offer some basic search
facilities. What you soon realize is that the search queries behave
quite a bit differently from most of the other queries you run.
They're really a whole new class of queries. Rather
than retrieving a very small amount of data in a very specific way
(fetching a message based on its ID or looking up a user based on
username), search queries are more intensive; they take more CPU time
to execute. And the full-text indexes are quite a bit larger than
your typical MyISAM indexes.</P>

<P class="docText">In a situation like this, it may make sense to split up the
responsibility for the various classes of queries
you're executing. Users often expect a search to
take a second or two to execute, but pulling up a post or a user page
should always happen instantly. To keep the longer-running search
queries from interfering with the "must be
fast" queries, you can break the slaves into logical
subgroups. They'll all still be fed by the same
master (for now), but they will be serving in more narrowly focused
roles.</P>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-8-FIG-2">Figure 8-2</A> shows a simple example of this with the
top half of the diagram omitted. There need not be two physically
different load balancers involved. Instead, think of those as logical
boxes rather than physical. Most load-balancing hardware can handle
dozens of backend clusters simultaneously.</P>

<P class="docText">With this separation in place, it's much easier to
match the hardware to the task at hand. Queries sent to the user
cluster are likely to be I/O bound rather taxing the CPU.
They're mainly fetching a few random rows off disk
over and over. So maybe it makes sense to spend less money on the
CPUs and invest a bit more in the disks and memory (for caching).
Perhaps RAID 0 is a good choice on these machines.</P>

<P class="docText">The search cluster, on the other hand, spends far more CPU time
looking through the full-text indexes to match search terms and
ranking results based on their score. The machines in this group
probably need faster (or dual) CPUs and a fair amount of memory.</P>

<P class="docText">This architecture is versatile enough to handle workload splitting
for a variety of applications. Anytime you notice an imbalance among
the types of queries, consider whether it might be worthwhile to
split your large cluster into a cluster made up of smaller groups
based on a division of labor.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.3.2 Data-Based Partitioning</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1758"></A>Some high-volume applications
have surprisingly little variety in the types of queries they use.
Partitioning across roles isn't effective in these
cases, so the alternative is to partition the data itself and put a
bit of additional logic into the application code. <A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-8-FIG-3">Figure 8-3</A> illustrates this.</P>

<P class="docText">In an application that deals with fetching user data from MySQL, a
simple partitioning scheme is to use the first character of the
username. Those beginning with letters A-M reside in the first
partition. The other partition handles the second half of the
alphabet. The additional application logic is simply a matter of
checking the username before deciding which database connection to
use when fetching the data.</P>

<P class="docText">The choice of splitting based on an alphabetic range is purely
arbitrary. You can just as easily use a numeric representation of
each username, sending all users with even numbers to one cluster and
all odd numbers to the other. Volumes have been written on efficient
and uniform hashing functions that can be used to group arbitrarily
large volumes of data into a fixed number of buckets. Our goal
isn't to recommend a particular method but to
suggest that you look at the wealth of existing information and
techniques before inventing something of your own.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.3.3 Filtering and Multicluster Partitioning</H4>

<P class="docText">Assuming that the majority of activity is read-only (that is, on the
slaves), the previous partitioning solutions scale well as the demand
on a high-volume application increases. But what happens when a
bottleneck develops on the master? The obvious solution is to upgrade
the master. If it is CPU-bound, add more CPU power. If
it's I/O bound, add faster disks and more of them.</P>

<P class="docText">There's a flaw in that logic, however. If the master
is having trouble keeping up with the load, the slaves will be under
at least as much stress. Remember that MySQL's
replication is query based. The volume of write queries handled by
the slaves is usually identical to that handled by the master. If the
master can no longer keep up, odds are that the slaves are struggling
just as much.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-SECT-3.3.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.3.3.1 Filtering</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1759"></A>An
easy solution to the problem is filtering. As described in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A>, MySQL provides the ability to filter the
replication stream selectively on both the master and the slave. The
problem is that you can filter based only on database or table names.
Filtering is therefore not an option if you use data-based
partitioning. MySQL has no facility to filter based on the queries
themselves, only the names of the databases and tables involved.</P>

<P class="docText">Filtering may work well in a role-based partitioning setup in which
the various slave clusters don't need full copies of
the master's data (for instance, where a search
cluster needs two particular tables, and the user cluster needs the
other four). If you use role-based partitioning,
it's probably worthwhile to set up each cluster to
replicate only the tables or databases the cluster needs to do its
job. The filtering must be on the slaves themselves, as opposed to
the master, so the slaves' IO thread will still copy
all the master's write queries. However, the SQL
thread will read right past queries the slaves
aren't interested in (those that are filtered out).</P>



<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-SECT-3.3.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.3.3.2 Separate clusters</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-8-ITERM-1760"></A>Aside from
Moore's Law, the only real solution to scaling the
write side with this model is to use truly separate clusters. By
going from a single master with many slaves to several independent
masters with their own slaves, you eliminate the bottlenecks
associated with a higher volume of write activity, and you can get
away with using less expensive hardware.</P>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-8-FIG-4">Figure 8-4</A> illustrates this logical progression. As
before, there are two groups of slaves, one for search and one for
user lookups, but this time each group is served by its own master.</P>
