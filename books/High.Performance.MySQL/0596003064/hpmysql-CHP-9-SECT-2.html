<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1785"></A>We
considered calling this section "Things You Really
Need To Think About" because backing up a running
database is more complex than it may first appear to be. This
isn't because backups are inherently difficult;
it's because MySQL is a bit more complex that you
might think.</P>

<P class="docText">When it comes to actually performing the backups, you can script the
process yourself, use one of the prebuilt tools, or both. It all
depends on your needs. In this section, we'll
examine the major decisions you'll need to make and
how they influence the backup techniques you can use. Then in the
next section we'll look at the most popular tools.</P>

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-2.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.2.1 Dump or Raw Backup?</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1786"></A>One of the first decisions
to make is the format of the backups you'd like to
create. The result of a database
<I>dump</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1787"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1788"></A>
is one or more files that contain the SQL statements (mostly
<TT>INSERT</TT> and <TT>CREATE</TT>
<TT>TABLE</TT>) necessary to re-create the data. Dumps are
produced using
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1789"></A>,
described in more detail in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-3.html#hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-3">Section 9.3</A>, later in this chapter. You
can perform dumps over the network so that your backups are created
on a host other than your database server. It's
possible to produce dumps of any MySQL table type.</P>

<P class="docText">Having the contents of the tables as SQL files provides a lot of
flexibility. If you simply need to look for a few records, you can
load the file in your favorite editor or use a tool such as
<span class="docEmphasis">grep</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">less</span> to locate the
data. The dumped data is quite readable.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1790"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1791"></A>Restoring a dump is easy.
Because the dump file contains all the necessary information to
re-create the table, you simply need to feed that file back into the
<span class="docEmphasis">mysql</span> command-line tool. And if you need to
restore only some of the records, you can directly edit the file
directly or write a script to prefilter out the records you
don't need. Raw backups don't
provide this flexibility. You can't easily filter
out records from a table when using a raw backup; you can operate
only on whole tables.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1792"></A>There
are some downsides to using dumps. A dump file consumes far more disk
space than the table or database it represents. Not only are there a
lot of <TT>INSERT</TT> statements in the file, all numeric
data (which MySQL stores quite efficiently) becomes ASCII, using
quite a bit more space. Dumps are more CPU-intensive to produce, so
they'll take longer than other methods. Dump files
compress rather well using tools such as <span class="docEmphasis">gzip</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">bzip2</span>. Also, reloading a dump requires that
MySQL spend considerable CPU time to rebuild all the indexes.</P>

<P class="docText">Because there's often a fair amount of unused space
and overhead in InnoDB's data files,
you'll find that InnoDB tables often take far less
space that you might expect when backed up.</P>

<P class="docText">While dumps have a lot of advantages, the extra space, time, and CPU
power they require are often not worth expending—especially as
your databases get larger and larger. It's more
efficient to use a <I>raw
backup</I><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1793"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1794"></A> technique rather than using dumps. A
raw backup is a direct copy of MySQL's data files as
they exist on disk. Because the records aren't
converted from their native format to ASCII, raw backups are much
faster and more efficient than dumps. For ISAM and MyISAM tables,
this means copying the data, index, and table definition files. For
BDB and InnoDB tables, it also involves preserving the transaction
logs and the data.</P>

<P class="docText">Both
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlhotcopy</span><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1795"></A>
and
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlsnapshot</span><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1796"></A>,
which we describe in some detail later, can be used to produce raw
backups of ISAM and MyISAM tables. They do so by locking and flushing
the tables before copying the underlying files. The tables may not be
written to during the backup process. The InnoDB Hot Backup tool,
also discussed later in this chapter, provides a raw backup of your
InnoDB data without the need for downtime or locking. There is no
equivalent tool for BDB tables.</P>

<P class="docText">Raw backups are most often used to back up a live server. To get a
consistent backup, ISAM and MyISAM tables need to be locked so that
no changes can occur until the backup completes. InnoDB tables have
no such restriction.</P>

<P class="docText">Restoring a raw backup is relatively easy. For ISAM and MyISAM
tables, you simply put the data files in MySQL's
data directory. Unless you're using
InnoDB's multiple-tablespace support in Version 4.1
or newer, InnoDB tables can't be restored
individually from a raw backup because they are stored in shared
tablespace files rather than individually. Instead,
you'll need to shut down MySQL and restore the
tablespace files.</P>

<P class="docText">If you have the luxury of shutting down MySQL to perform backups, the
backup and restore processes can be greatly simplified. In fact,
that's the next decision to consider.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-2.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.2.2 Online or Offline?</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1797"></A>Being able to shut down MySQL during
backups means not having to worry about consistency problems
(discussed in the next section), locking out changes from live
applications, or degrading server performance. A nonrunning MySQL
instance can be backed up using standard backup software.
There's no danger of files changing. If MySQL
isn't running, the backup process will likely be
faster too; it won't be competing with MySQL for I/O
and CPU cycles.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're planning to shut down MySQL during
backups, make sure that your backup software is configured to back up
all of the MySQL-related data. Ideally, you'd back
up the entire system, but there may be cases when that
isn't feasible. Large MySQL installations often span
several filesystems. The binaries may be in one place, config files
in another, and the data files elsewhere. Having them on different
backup schedules could leave you with a difficult problem if you need
to restore just after a major upgrade. The config files may not match
the data file locations, for example.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-2.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.2.3 Table Types and Consistency</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1798"></A>Maintaining consistency is one of
the most tricky and often overlooked issues in database backups. You
need to ensure that you're getting a consistent
snapshot of your data. Doing so requires an understanding of the
types of tables you need to back up and how MySQL handles them.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're using MyISAM tables, simply making copies
of the various data files isn't sufficient. You must
guarantee that all changes have been flushed to disk and that MySQL
won't be making changes to any of the tables during
the backup process. The obvious solution is to obtain a read lock on
each table before it is backed up. That will prevent anyone from
making changes to the table while still allowing them to read from
it.</P>

<P class="docText">That technique works well for a single table, but in a relational
database, tables are often related to each other. Records inserted
into one table depend on those in another. If that's
not accounted for, you can end up with an inconsistent
backup—records may exist in one table but have no counterparts
in another. It all depends on the order in which the tables were
copied and the likelihood that changes were made to one while the
other was backed up.</P>

<P class="docText">So a good backup program needs to lock groups of related tables
before they are copied. Rather than deal with that complexity, the
popular solutions for MySQL give you the option of either locking all
tables and keeping them locked until the backup is done, or locking
and backing up tables one at a time.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-9-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> If neither option appeals to you,
there's a good chance that you need to script your
own solution. See <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-4.html#hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-4">Section 9.4</A>,
later in this chapter, for details.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> Ideally,
we'd have the option to unlock each table
selectively after it is copied, but MySQL doesn't
allow that yet.</p></blockquote>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-2.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.2.4 Storage Requirements</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1799"></A>The amount of space required to store
backups must factor into the decision-making process. How much room
does your backup media have? Tape, CD, DVD, and hard disks all have
capacity limits, costs, and lifetimes.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-9-FNOTE-4">[4]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-FNOTE-4">[4]</A></sup> But hard disks
seem to be growing in capacity without bound. It
shouldn't be long before you can buy a tera-byte
hard disk.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">After you've determined how much space you can
afford and manage effectively, you need to consider how frequently
you really need to perform backups. Do you need to back up all your
data every day? Can you get by with backing up only your most active
tables or databases daily and performing a full backup on the
weekend? That will save a lot of space if much of your data changes
infrequently.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1800"></A>When dealing with backups,
it's a good idea to consider compression. If
you're backing up to a tape drive with hardware
compression, it's handled for you automatically.
Otherwise, you can choose any compression scheme
you'd like. Most dump files and raw backups compress
rather well. However, if a lot of your data is already compressed
(either compressed MyISAM tables or tables with
<TT>BLOB</TT> fields that contain compressed data), there
will be little benefit in further compression attempts.</P>

<P class="docText">If you have more than a few compressed MyISAM tables, not only should
you avoid trying to compress them further, but you should also
consider backing them up less frequently. Compressed MyISAM tables
are read-only; by definition, they don't change
often. You'd have to uncompress the table, make
changes, and recompress it. That's rare.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1801"></A>The final issue to think about is
retention. How long do you need to keep backups around? Rather than
simply throwing out backups when you begin to run out of space,
it's best to plan ahead. By taking into account the
amount of data you must back up, the amount of space you need, and
how long you want to keep data around, you won't run
into surprises.</P>

<P class="docText">If you find yourself running out of space, consider staggering the
backups that you do save. Rather than always deleting the oldest
backups, you can use an alternative approach such as removing backups
that fall on odd-numbered days. That would allow you to double the
age of your oldest backup.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-2.5"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.2.5 Replication</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1802"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1803"></A>If you're using
MySQL's replication features (described in <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A>), you can be a lot more flexible in your
approach to backups. In fact, you may want to set up a slave just to
simplify backups.</P>

<P class="docText">By performing backups on a slave, you eliminate the need ever to
interrupt systems that may need to make changes on the master. In a
24 x 7 x 365 operation, this is an excellent
way to ensure that you always have a copy of your data on another
machine (this method is commonly used at Yahoo!). And since you can
switch to the slave if the master dies, it significantly reduces the
downtime when something does go wrong.</P>

<P class="docText">When backing up a slave, it's important always to
save the replication files as well. That includes the
<I>master.info</I> file, relay logs, relay index, and
so on. Without them, you can't easily restore a
slave that has suffered a failure. The files contain information
about where the slave left off in the replication process. See <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-7.html#hpmysql-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A> for more information.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1804"></A></P>
