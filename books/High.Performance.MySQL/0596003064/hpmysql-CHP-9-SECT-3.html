<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1805"></A>With
an understanding of the various backup-related issues you need to
consider, let's move on to examining the tools
available. If you have a complex configuration or unusual needs,
there's a chance that none of these alone will do
the job for you. Instead, you'll need to build a
custom solution—possibly using one or more of the tools
described here.</P>

<P class="docText">This section isn't intended to be a comprehensive
reference for each tool. Instead, it focuses on presenting the
relevant features of each one so that you better understand your
choices. Once you've selected a tool, be sure to
consult the documentation for it. There's a good
chance that the tool has options that didn't exist
when this book was written. We will post news about available tools
at our web site: <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://highperformancemysql.com">http://highperformancemysql.com</A> (see the

<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-SECT-3.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.3.1 mysqldump</H4>

<P class="docText">For a long time, <span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1806"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1807"></A> was
the only backup tool available for MySQL. It is a command-line
utility for dumping tables of any type into SQL flat files. It even
handles foreign-key constraints properly.
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span> comes with MySQL, so
you're guaranteed to have it installed already.</P>

<P class="docText">Using <span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span> to perform dumps is ideally
suited to backing up small databases. The resulting files are large
compared to the data being dumped, and it's not a
very efficient process.</P>

<P class="docText">To back up all the databases on a server, execute the following
command:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqldump -u root -pPassword -x --all-databases &gt; dump.sql</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">The <TT>-x</TT> flag tells <span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span>
to lock all tables during the backup to ensure consistency.</P>

<P class="docText">There are a few drawbacks to that method. Most importantly, the
entire dump will go to a single file, which can result in a very
large file if you have a lot of data to back up.
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span> doesn't have an
option to split the output into separate files based on database or
table name.</P>

<P class="docText">If you need to back up a subset of all the databases, you can provide
a list of database names on the command line:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqldump -u root -pPassword -x --databases db1 db2 db3 &gt; dump.sql</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">This creates a dump file with the information necessary to recreate
the <TT>db1</TT>, <TT>db2</TT>, and
<TT>db3</TT> databases.</P>

<P class="docText">If you need to back up only a few tables from a single database, you
can provide the database and table names:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqldump -u root -pPassword -x db1 table1 table2 table3 &gt; dump.sql</B></PRE>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span> works well over the network, too. By
adding a <TT>-h</TT> argument, you tell it to connect to a
remote MySQL host instead:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqldump -h db.example.com -u root -pPassword -x --all-databases &gt; dump.sql</B></PRE>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">9.3.1.1 Restoring</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1808"></A>No
matter which options you use, restoring a dump is always
straightforward. Simply feed the dump file back through the
<span class="docEmphasis">mysql</span> command-line tool:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysql -u root -pPassword &lt; dump.sql</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">If you find yourself restoring dump files frequently (perhaps on a
test server), consider using
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span>'s
<TT>--extended-insert</TT> option. It tells
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span> to bundle many insert statements
together using MySQL's bulk insert syntax:</P>

<PRE>INSERT INTO mytable (col1, col2, col3)
VALUES (val1, val2, val3) (val1, val2, val3) ...</PRE>

<P class="docText">This makes the restore run far faster than the default method, which
uses one insert statement per row. It also results in much smaller
dump files.</P>

<P class="docText">Normally, <span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span> requests all the rows for
the table it is dumping, buffers them in memory, and writes the data
to disk. It does this to minimize the amount of time tables are
locked on the server. However, when dumping large tables, you need to
use the <TT>--quick</TT> option; it prevents the buffering,
instead telling <span class="docEmphasis">mysqldump</span> to fetch rows from the
server one at a time. While it's a bit
slower<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-CHP-9-FNOTE-5">[5]</A></sup> than the default method,
it's the only option when your tables are too big to
fit in memory on the host that's running the dump.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-FNOTE-5">[5]</A></sup> That's not a typo. The
<TT>--quick</TT> option causes the dump process to take a
bit more time.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">In fact, you might consider using the <TT>--opt</TT>
option. It enables several useful options at once, including
<TT>--quick</TT> and <TT>--extended-insert</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Windows users should use the <TT>--result-file</TT> option
to specify an output file:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqldump -u root -pPassword --all-databases --result-file=dump.sql</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Otherwise, Windows converts all newline characters
(<TT>\n</TT>) to a carriage return plus newline
(<TT>\r\n</TT>). The silent conversion will cause endless
frustration when you need to restore a table in a hurry.<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1809"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1810"></A></P>

purpose is to automate the process of backing up a database
consisting of ISAM and MyISAM tables while the server is running.
It's the most popular tool available for performing
online raw backups and is best suited to backing up single databases
on a live server. It operates by getting a read lock on all the
tables to be copied, copying them, and then releasing the lock. This
means it doesn't scale very well as traffic or size
increase.</P>

<P class="docText">As you can see, <span class="docEmphasis">mysqlhotcopy</span> copies the data
(.<span class="docEmphasis">MYD</span>), index (.<span class="docEmphasis">MYI</span>), and
table definition (.<span class="docEmphasis">frm</span>) files for each table in
the test database. To conserve space, you may choose to back up only
the .<span class="docEmphasis">frm</span> and .<span class="docEmphasis">MYD</span> files in
their entirety. Given the <TT>--noindices</TT> option,
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlhotcopy</span> copies only the first 2,048 bytes

MySQL needs to reconstruct the indexes at a later date.</P>

<PRE>$ <B>mysqlhotcopy -u root -p Password --noindices test /tmp</B></PRE>

it would be a much smaller and easier to maintain than
<span class="docEmphasis">mysqlhotcopy</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">He hasn't yet submitted <span class="docEmphasis">mysqlsnapshot</span>

large amount of data in InnoDB and would like online backups, the
InnoDB Hot Backup tool is the best choice. Unlike MySQL,
it's not free. Rather, it's a
relatively inexpensive commercial tool developed by the makers of
InnoDB. See <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html">http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html</A> for

Then run it like this:</P>

<PRE>$ <B>ibbackup /etc/my.cnf /etc/ibbackup.cnf</B></PRE>

its own configuration. Recent versions of

<P class="docText">It's important to note that
<span class="docEmphasis">ibbackup</span> doesn't back up the

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1822"></A>As discussed earlier, there are
numerous benefits to shutting down MySQL before performing a backup.
To recap:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">There will be no consistency problems.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">You can use existing backup software.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Backups can be very fast.</P></LI></UL>

this:</P>

<PRE># Now, shut down MySQL before the backup begins.
mysqladmin -u root -pPassword shutdown

# And start the backup
...

# Then bring MySQL back up
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe &amp;</PRE>

<P class="docText">If you use a prepackaged backup system, you need to ensure that MySQL
is down before it starts. If the backup software is run locally on
the MySQL server, that's easy. Rather than running
the software directly, create a small shell script or batch file that
handles the stopping and starting of MySQL around the backup
process—much like the previous example.</P>

<P class="docText">In larger environments, it is common to run client/server backup
software. The backup server contacts a daemon running on a remote
server when it is time for the backup process to begin. That daemon
(running on your MySQL server) then feeds data to the backup server
over the network. It is also common in such environments to let the
backup software control the exact starting time of the backup.</P>

<P class="docText">In a case like that, you may need to find an alternative approach for
backing up MySQL, or you'll need to do some digging
in the backup software's manual.
There's a good chance that you can find a way to
make the backup software start and stop MySQL when it needs to. If
not, you may be able to use one of the other backup strategies. If
you have sufficient disk space, you can perform the backup directly
on the MySQL server and let your normal backup process back up those
files.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.3.6 Filesystem Snapshots</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1825"></A>Taking a snapshot of
MySQL's data is the fastest and least intrusive
method of backing up an online server. While the implementation
details vary, a snapshot is an online copy of your data—usually
stored on the same filesystem or volume. In fact, most systems use a
copy-on-write scheme to minimize the free space required to take a
snapshot.</P>

<P class="docText">MySQL itself provides no support for taking snapshots, but various
free and commercial filesystems and storage solutions do. In the
Linux world, <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1826"></A><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1827"></A>LVM (the
Linux volume manager) has snapshot capabilities.
<A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1828"></A>Veritas sells a filesystem product for
most versions of Unix (and Linux) that can take snapshots. FreeBSD
5.x may offer snapshot capabilities too.</P>

<P class="docText">In the hardware space, <A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1829"></A>Network Appliance's
popular "filers" can be used to
take filesystem snapshots. EMC has two ways of doing this: snapshots,
which are just like the snapshots described above, and BCVs (business
continuance volumes). They are, in effect, additional mirrors of a
volume that can be broken off and mounted on other systems. They
require double the amount of storage and are therefore expensive.</P>

<P class="docText">Snapshots are best used with a more traditional backup solution. By
itself, a snapshot doesn't do much to guard against
hardware failures. Sure, you can use a snapshot to quickly restore an
accidentally dropped table, but all the snapshots in the world
won't help if the disk controller catches fire.</P>

<P class="docText">Be sure that you have sufficient space reserved on your volume for
the number of snapshots you plan to keep online. Most
snapshot-capable filesystems require that you reserve a minimum
amount of disk space for snapshot data. If your server processes a
lot of write queries, you can easily exceed the reserved space. Check
your filesystem documentation for complete details.</P>

<P class="docText">Just as with the other approach to online backups, you must be
careful to flush and obtain a read lock on all ISAM and MyISAM tables
before initiating a snapshot. The easiest way to do this is to use
MySQL's
<TT>FLUSH</TT><A NAME="hpmysql-CHP-9-ITERM-1830"></A> <TT>TABLES</TT>
<TT>WITH</TT> <TT>READ</TT>
<TT>LOCK</TT> command. It will hold the lock until you
disconnect from MySQL or issue an <TT>UNLOCK</TT>
<TT>TABLES</TT> command. We'll discuss
this in the next section.</P>
