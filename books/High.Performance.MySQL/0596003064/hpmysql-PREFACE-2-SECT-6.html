<P class="docText">A book like this doesn't come into being without
help from literally dozens of people. Without their assistance, the
book you hold in your hands would probably still be a bunch of sticky
notes on the side of our monitors. This is the part of the book where
we get to say whatever we like about the folks who helped us out, and
we don't have to worry about music playing in the
background telling us to shut up and go away, as you might see on TV
during an awards show.</P>

<P class="docText">We couldn't have completed this project without the
constant prodding, begging, pleading, and support from our editor,
Andy Oram.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#hpmysql-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> If there is one
person most responsible for the book in your hands,
it's Andy. We really do appreciate the weekly nag
sessions.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="hpmysql-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> Then again, if there's a
second edition on the horizon, one might argue that this project is
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> complete.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Andy isn't alone, though. At
O'Reilly there are a bunch of other folks who had
some part in getting those sticky notes converted to a cohesive book
that you'd be willing to read, so we also have to
thank the production, illustration, and marketing folks for helping
to pull this book together. And, of course, thanks to Tim
O'Reilly for his continued commitment to producing
some of the industry's finest documentation for
popular open source software.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, we'd both like to give a big thanks to the
folks who agreed to look over the various drafts of the book and tell
us all the things we were doing wrong: our reviewers. They spent part
of their 2003 holiday break looking over roughly formatted versions
of this text, full of typos, misleading statements, and outright
mathematical errors. In no particular order, thanks to Brian
"Krow" Aker, Mark
"JDBC" Matthews, Jeremy
"the other Jeremy" Cole, Mike
"VBMySQL.com" Hillyer, Raymond
"Rainman" De Roo, Jeffrey
"Regex Master" Friedl, Jason
DeHaan, Dan Nelson, Steve "Unix
Wiz" Friedl, and last but not least, Kasia
"Unix Girl" Trapszo.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">From Jeremy</H4>

<P class="docText">I would again like to thank Andy for agreeing to take on this project
and for continually beating on us for more chapter material.
Derek's help was essential for getting the last
20-30% of the book completed so that we wouldn't
miss yet another target date. Thanks for agreeing to come on board
late in the process and deal with my sporadic bursts of productivity,
and for handling XML grunt work, <A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-CHP-10.html#hpmysql-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>
<A class="docLink" HREF="hpmysql-APP-C.html#hpmysql-APP-C">Appendix C</A>, and all the other stuff I threw your
way.</P>

<P class="docText">I also need to thank my parents for getting me that first Commodore
64 computer so many years ago. They not only tolerated the first 10
years of what seems to be a life-long obsession with electronics and
computer technology, but quickly became supporters of my never-ending
quest to learn and do more.</P>

<P class="docText">Next I'd like to thank a group of people
I've had the distinct pleasure of working with while
spreading MySQL religion at Yahoo during the last few years. Jeffrey
Friedl and Ray Goldberger provided encouragement and feedback from
the earliest stages of this undertaking. Along with them, Steve
Morris, James Harvey, and Sergey Kolychev put up with my seemingly
constant experimentation on the Yahoo! Finance MySQL servers, even
when it interrupted their important work. Thanks also to the
countless other Yahoos who have helped me find interesting MySQL
problems and solutions. And, most importantly, thanks for having the
trust and faith in me needed to put MySQL into some of the most
important and visible parts of Yahoo's business.</P>

<P class="docText">Adam Goodman, the publisher and owner of <span class="docEmphasis">Linux
Magazine</span>, helped me ease into the world of writing for a
technical audience by publishing my first feature-length MySQL
articles back in 2001. Since then, he's taught me
more than he realizes about editing and publishing and has encouraged
me to continue on this road with my own monthly column in the
magazine. Thanks, Adam.</P>

<P class="docText">Thanks to Monty and David for sharing MySQL with the world. Speaking
of MySQL AB, thanks to all the other great folks there who have
encouraged me in writing this: Kerry, Larry, Joe, Marten, Brian,
Paul, Jeremy, Mark, Harrison, Matt, and the rest of the team there.
You guys rock.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, thanks to all my weblog readers for encouraging me to write
informally about MySQL and other technical topics on a daily basis.
And, last but not least, thanks to the Goon Squad.</P>


<A NAME="hpmysql-PREFACE-2-SECT-6.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">From Derek</H4>

<P class="docText">Like Jeremy, I've got to thank my family, for much
the same reasons. I want to thank my parents for their constant
goading that I should write a book, even if this
isn't anywhere near what they had in mind. My
grandparents helped me learn two valuable lessons, the meaning of the
dollar and how much I would fall in love with computers, as she
loaned me the money to buy my first Commodore VIC-20.</P>

<P class="docText">I can't thank Jeremy enough for inviting me to join
him on the whirlwind book-writing roller coaster.
It's been a great experience and I look forward to
working with him again in the future.</P>

<P class="docText">A special thanks goes out to Raymond De Roo, Brian Wohlgemuth, David
Calafrancesco, Tera Doty, Jay Rubin, Bill Catlan, Anthony Howe, Mark
O'Neal, George Montgomery, George Barber, and the
myriad other people who patiently listened to me gripe about things,
let me bounce ideas off them to see whether an outsider could
understand what I was trying to say, or just managed to bring a smile
to my face when I needed it most. Without you, this book might still
have been written, but I almost certainly would have gone crazy in
the process.</P>
