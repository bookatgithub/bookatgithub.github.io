<h2 class="sect2-title">Introduction</h2>
<p class="first-para">This part will get you started in thinking about designing and analyzing algorithms. It is intended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms, some of the design strategies we will use throughout this book, and many of the fundamental ideas used in algorithm analysis. Later parts of this book will build upon this base.</p>
<p class="para">
<a href="DDU0011.html#28" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 1</a> is an overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems. This chapter defines what an algorithm is and lists some examples. It also makes a case that algorithms are a technology, just as are fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and networks.</p>
<p class="para">In <a href="DDU0014.html#57" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 2</a>, we see our first algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting a sequence of <i class="emphasis">n</i> numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, although not directly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the structure of the algorithm clearly enough that a competent programmer can implement it in the language of his choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort, which uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive technique known as "divide and conquer." Although the time each requires increases with the value of <i class="emphasis">n</i>, the rate of increase differs between the two algorithms. We determine these running times in <a href="DDU0014.html#57" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 2</a>, and we develop a useful notation to express them.</p>
<p class="para">
<a href="DDU0018.html#122" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 3</a> precisely defines this notation, which we call asymptotic notation. It starts by defining several asymptotic notations, which we use for bounding algorithm running times from above and/or below. The rest of <a href="DDU0018.html#122" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 3</a> is primarily a presentation of mathematical notation. Its purpose is more to ensure that your use of notation matches that in this book than to teach you new mathematical concepts.<a name="27"></a><a name="IDX-4"></a>
</p>
<p class="para">
<a href="DDU0022.html#203" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 4</a> delves further into the divide-and-conquer method introduced in <a href="DDU0014.html#57" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 2</a>. In particular, <a href="DDU0022.html#203" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 4</a> contains methods for solving recurrences, which are useful for describing the running times of recursive algorithms. One powerful technique is the "master method," which can be used to solve recurrences that arise from divide-and-conquer algorithms. Much of <a href="DDU0022.html#203" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 4</a> is devoted to proving the correctness of the master method, though this proof may be skipped without harm.</p>
<p class="para">
<a href="DDU0029.html#296" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 5</a> introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. We typically use probabilistic analysis to determine the running time of an algorithm in cases in which, due to the presence of an inherent probability distribution, the running time may differ on different inputs of the same size. In some cases, we assume that the inputs conform to a known probability distribution, so that we are averaging the running time over all possible inputs. In other cases, the probability distribution comes not from the inputs but from random choices made during the course of the algorithm. An algorithm whose behavior is determined not only by its input but by the values produced by a random-number generator is a randomized algorithm. We can use randomized algorithms to enforce a probability distribution on the inputs<span class="unicode">-</span>thereby ensuring that no particular input always causes poor performance<span class="unicode">-</span>or even to bound the error rate of algorithms that are allowed to produce incorrect results on a limited basis.</p>
<p class="last-para">Appendices A<span class="unicode">-</span>C contain other mathematical material that you will find helpful as you read this book. You are likely to have seen much of the material in the appendix chapters before having read this book (although the specific notational conventions we use may differ in some cases from what you have seen in the past), and so you should think of the Appendices as reference material. On the other hand, you probably have not already seen most of the material in <a class="internaljump" href="#pt01">Part I</a>. All the chapters in <a class="internaljump" href="#pt01">Part I</a> and the Appendices are written with a tutorial flavor.</p>
