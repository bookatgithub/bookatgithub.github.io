If you are unfamiliar with the basics of probability theory, you should read <a href="DDU0253.html#3407" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Appendix C</a>, which reviews this material. Probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms will be revisited several times throughout this book.</p>

<p class="first-para">Suppose that you need to hire a new office assistant. Your previous attempts at hiring have been unsuccessful, and you decide to use an employment agency. The employment agency will send you one candidate each day. You will interview that person and then decide to either hire that person or not. You must pay the employment agency a small fee to interview an applicant. To actually hire an applicant is more costly, however, since you must fire your current office assistant and pay a large hiring fee to the employment agency. You are committed to having, at all times, the best possible person for the job. Therefore, you decide that, after interviewing each applicant, if that applicant is better qualified than the current office assistant, you will fire the current office assistant and hire the new applicant. You are willing to pay the resulting price of this strategy, but you wish to estimate what that price will be.</p>
<p class="para">The procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT, given below, expresses this strategy for hiring in pseudocode. It assumes that the candidates for the office assistant job are numbered 1 through <i class="emphasis">n</i>. The procedure assumes that you are able to, after interviewing candidate <i class="emphasis">i</i>, determine if candidate <i class="emphasis">i</i> is the best candidate you have seen so far. To initialize, the procedure creates a dummy candidate, numbered 0, who is less qualified than each of the other candidates.<a name="299"></a><a name="IDX-92"></a>

<p class="para">The cost model for this problem differs from the model described in <a href="DDU0014.html#57" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 2</a>. We are not concerned with the running time of HIRE-ASSISTANT, but instead with the cost incurred by interviewing and hiring. On the surface, analyzing the cost of this algorithm may seem very different from analyzing the running time of, say, merge sort. The analytical techniques used, however, are identical whether we are analyzing cost or running time. In either case, we are counting the number of times certain basic operations are executed.</p>
<p class="para">Interviewing has a low cost, say <i class="emphasis">c<sub>i</sub></i>, whereas hiring is expensive, costing <i class="emphasis">c<sub>h</sub></i>. Let <i class="emphasis">m</i> be the number of people hired. Then the total cost associated with this algorithm is <i class="emphasis">O</i>(<i class="emphasis">nc<sub>i</sub></i> + <i class="emphasis">mc<sub>h</sub></i>). No matter how many people we hire, we always interview <i class="emphasis">n</i> candidates and thus always incur the cost <i class="emphasis">nc<sub>i</sub></i> associated with interviewing. We therefore concentrate on analyzing <i class="emphasis">mc<sub>h</sub></i>, the hiring cost. This quantity varies with each run of the algorithm.</p>
<p class="para">This scenario serves as a model for a common computational paradigm. It is often the case that we need to find the maximum or minimum value in a sequence by examining each element of the sequence and maintaining a current "winner." The hiring problem models how often we update our notion of which element is currently winning.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4 class="sect4-title">
<a name="300"></a><a name="ch05lev3sec1"></a>Worst-case analysis</h4>
<p class="first-para">In the worst case, we actually hire every candidate that we interview. This situation occurs if the candidates come in increasing order of quality, in which case we hire <i class="emphasis">n</i> times, for a total hiring cost of <i class="emphasis">O</i>(<i class="emphasis">nc<sub>h</sub></i>).</p>
<p class="last-para">It might be reasonable to expect, however, that the candidates do not always come in increasing order of quality. In fact, we have no idea about the order in which they arrive, nor do we have any control over this order. Therefore, it is natural to ask what we expect to happen in a typical or average case.</p>

<a name="301"></a><a name="ch05lev3sec2"></a>Probabilistic analysis</h4>
<p class="first-para">
<b class="bold"><i class="emphasis">Probabilistic analysis</i></b> is the use of probability in the analysis of problems. Most commonly, we use probabilistic analysis to analyze the running time of an algorithm. Sometimes, we use it to analyze other quantities, such as the hiring cost in <a name="302"></a><a name="IDX-93"></a>procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT. In order to perform a probabilistic analysis, we must use knowledge of, or make assumptions about, the distribution of the inputs. Then we analyze our algorithm, computing an expected running time. The expectation is taken over the distribution of the possible inputs. Thus we are, in effect, averaging the running time over all possible inputs.</p>
<p class="para">We must be very careful in deciding on the distribution of inputs. For some problems, it is reasonable to assume something about the set of all possible inputs, and we can use probabilistic analysis as a technique for designing an efficient algorithm and as a means for gaining insight into a problem. For other problems, we cannot describe a reasonable input distribution, and in these cases we cannot use probabilistic analysis.</p>
<p class="para">For the hiring problem, we can assume that the applicants come in a random order. What does that mean for this problem? We assume that we can compare any two candidates and decide which one is better qualified; that is, there is a total order on the candidates. (See <a href="DDU0247.html#3329" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Appendix B</a> for the definition of a total order.) We can therefore rank each candidate with a unique number from 1 through <i class="emphasis">n</i>, using <i class="emphasis">rank(i)</i> to denote the rank of applicant <i class="emphasis">i</i>, and adopt the convention that a higher rank corresponds to a better qualified applicant. The ordered list <span class="unicode">&lt;</span><i class="emphasis">rank</i>(1), <i class="emphasis">rank</i>(2), ..., <i class="emphasis">rank</i>(<i class="emphasis">n</i>)<span class="unicode">&gt;</span> is a permutation of the list <span class="unicode">&lt;</span>1, 2, ..., <i class="emphasis">n</i><span class="unicode">&gt;</span>. Saying that the applicants come in a random order is equivalent to saying that this list of ranks is equally likely to be any one of the <i class="emphasis">n</i>! permutations of the numbers 1 through <i class="emphasis">n</i>. Alternatively, we say that the ranks form a <b class="bold"><i class="emphasis">uniform random permutation</i></b>; that is, each of the possible <i class="emphasis">n</i>! permutations appears with equal probability.</p>

<a href="DDU0030.html#308" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 5.2</a> contains a probabilistic analysis of the hiring problem.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="sect4-title">
<a name="303"></a><a name="ch05lev3sec3"></a>Randomized algorithms</h4>
<p class="first-para">In order to use probabilistic analysis, we need to know something about the distribution on the inputs. In many cases, we know very little about the input distribution. Even if we do know something about the distribution, we may not be able to model this knowledge computationally. Yet we often can use probability and randomness as a tool for algorithm design and analysis, by making the behavior of part of the algorithm random.</p>
<p class="para">In the hiring problem, it may seem as if the candidates are being presented to us in a random order, but we have no way of knowing whether or not they really are. Thus, in order to develop a randomized algorithm for the hiring problem, we must have greater control over the order in which we interview the candidates. We will, therefore, change the model slightly. We will say that the employment agency has <i class="emphasis">n</i> candidates, and they send us a list of the candidates in advance. On each day, we choose, randomly, which candidate to interview. Although we know nothing about the candidates (besides their names), we have made a significant change. <a name="304"></a><a name="IDX-94"></a>Instead of relying on a guess that the candidates will come to us in a random order, we have instead gained control of the process and enforced a random order.</p>
<p class="para">More generally, we call an algorithm <b class="bold"><i class="emphasis">randomized</i></b> if its behavior is determined not only by its input but also by values produced by a <b class="bold"><i class="emphasis">random-number generator</i></b>. We shall assume that we have at our disposal a random-number generator RANDOM. A call to RANDOM(<i class="emphasis">a</i>, <i class="emphasis">b</i>) returns an integer between <i class="emphasis">a</i> and <i class="emphasis">b</i>, inclusive, with each such integer being equally likely. For example, RANDOM(0, 1) produces 0 with probability 1/2, and it produces 1 with probability 1/2. A call to RANDOM(3, 7) returns either 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, each with probability 1/5. Each integer returned by RANDOM is independent of the integers returned on previous calls. You may imagine RANDOM as rolling a (<i class="emphasis">b</i> - <i class="emphasis">a</i> + 1)-sided die to obtain its output. (In practice, most programming environments offer a <b class="bold"><i class="emphasis">pseudorandom-number generator</i></b>: a deterministic algorithm returning numbers that "look" statistically random.)a</p>
