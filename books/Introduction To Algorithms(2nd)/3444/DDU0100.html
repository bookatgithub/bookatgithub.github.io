<p class="para">In an <b class="bold"><i class="emphasis">amortized analysis</i></b>, the time required to perform a sequence of data-structure operations is averaged over all the operations performed. Amortized analysis can be used to show that the average cost of an operation is small, if one averages over a sequence of operations, even though a single operation within the sequence might be expensive. Amortized analysis differs from average-case analysis in that probability is not involved; an amortized analysis guarantees the <i class="emphasis">average performance of each operation in the worst case</i>.</p>
<div class="highlights">
<p class="first-para">The first three sections of this chapter cover the three most common techniques used in amortized analysis. <a href="DDU0101.html#1254" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 17.1</a> starts with aggregate analysis, in which we determine an upper bound <i class="emphasis">T</i> (<i class="emphasis">n</i>) on the total cost of a sequence of <i class="emphasis">n</i> operations. The average cost per operation is then <i class="emphasis">T</i> (<i class="emphasis">n</i>)/<i class="emphasis">n</i>. We take the average cost as the amortized cost of each operation, so that all operations have the same amortized cost.</p>
<p class="para">
<a href="DDU0102.html#1266" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 17.2</a> covers the accounting method, in which we determine an amortized cost of each operation. When there is more than one type of operation, each type of operation may have a different amortized cost. The accounting method overcharges some operations early in the sequence, storing the overcharge as "prepaid credit" on specific objects in the data structure. The credit is used later in the sequence to pay for operations that are charged less than they actually cost.</p>
<p class="para">
<a href="DDU0103.html#1275" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 17.3</a> discusses the potential method, which is like the accounting method in that we determine the amortized cost of each operation and may overcharge operations early on to compensate for undercharges later. The potential method maintains the credit as the "potential energy" of the data structure as a whole instead of associating the credit with individual objects within the data structure.</p>
<p class="para">We shall use two examples to examine these three methods. One is a stack with the additional operation MULTIPOP, which pops several objects at once. The other is a binary counter that counts up from 0 by means of the single operation INCREMENT.</p>
<p class="para">While reading this chapter, bear in mind that the charges assigned during an amortized analysis are for analysis purposes only. They need not and should not <a name="1253"></a><a name="IDX-406"></a>appear in the code. If, for example, a credit is assigned to an object <i class="emphasis">x</i> when using the accounting method, there is no need to assign an appropriate amount to some attribute <i class="emphasis">credit</i>[<i class="emphasis">x</i>] in the code.</p>
<p class="last-para">The insight into a particular data structure gained by performing an amortized analysis can help in optimizing the design. In <a href="DDU0104.html#1291" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 17.4</a>, for example, we shall use the potential method to analyze a dynamically expanding and contracting table.</p>
