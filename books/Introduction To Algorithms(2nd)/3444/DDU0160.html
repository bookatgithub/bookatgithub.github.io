<p class="para">Just as we can model a road map as a directed graph in order to find the shortest path from one point to another, we can also interpret a directed graph as a "flow network" and use it to answer questions about material flows. Imagine a material coursing through a system from a source, where the material is produced, to a sink, where it is consumed. The source produces the material at some steady rate, and the sink consumes the material at the same rate. The "flow" of the material at any point in the system is intuitively the rate at which the material moves. Flow networks can be used to model liquids flowing through pipes, parts through assembly lines, current through electrical networks, information through communication networks, and so forth.</p>
<p class="para">Each directed edge in a flow network can be thought of as a conduit for the material. Each conduit has a stated capacity, given as a maximum rate at which the material can flow through the conduit, such as 200 gallons of liquid per hour through a pipe or 20 amperes of electrical current through a wire. Vertices are conduit junctions, and other than the source and sink, material flows through the vertices without collecting in them. In other words, the rate at which material enters a vertex must equal the rate at which it leaves the vertex. We call this property "flow conservation," and it is equivalent to Kirchhoff's Current Law when the material is electrical current.</p>
<div class="highlights">
<p class="first-para">In the maximum-flow problem, we wish to compute the greatest rate at which material can be shipped from the source to the sink without violating any capacity constraints. It is one of the simplest problems concerning flow networks and, as we shall see in this chapter, this problem can be solved by efficient algorithms. Moreover, the basic techniques used in maximum-flow algorithms can be adapted to solve other network-flow problems.</p>
<p class="last-para">This chapter presents two general methods for solving the maximum-flow problem. <a href="DDU0161.html#1964" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 26.1</a> formalizes the notions of flow networks and flows, formally defining the maximum-flow problem. <a href="DDU0162.html#1989" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 26.2</a> describes the classical method of Ford and Fulkerson for finding maximum flows. An application of this method, finding a maximum matching in an undirected bipartite graph, is given in <a href="DDU0163.html#2035" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 26.3</a>.<a name="1963"></a><a name="IDX-644"></a> <a href="DDU0164.html#2050" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 26.4</a> presents the push-relabel method, which underlies many of the fastest algorithms for network-flow problems. <a href="DDU0165.html#2089" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 26.5</a> covers the "relabel-to-front" algorithm, a particular implementation of the push-relabel method that runs in time <i class="emphasis">O</i>(<i class="emphasis">V</i><sup>3</sup>). Although this algorithm is not the fastest algorithm known, it illustrates some of the techniques used in the asymptotically fastest algorithms, and it is reasonably efficient in practice.</p>
