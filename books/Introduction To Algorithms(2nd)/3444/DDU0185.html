<p class="first-para">Linear programming has a large number of applications. Any textbook on operations research is filled with examples of linear programming, and it is now a standard tool taught to students in most business schools. The election scenario is one typical example. Two more examples of linear programming are the following:</p>
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="first-para">An airline wishes to schedule its flight crews. The Federal Aviation Administration imposes many constraints, such as limiting the number of consecutive hours that each crew member can work and insisting that a particular crew work only on one model of aircraft during each month. The airline wants to schedule crews on all of its flights using as few crew members as possible.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">An oil company wants to decide where to drill for oil. Siting a drill at a particular location has an associated cost and, based on geological surveys, an expected payoff of some number of barrels of oil. The company has a limited budget for locating new drills and wants to maximize the amount of oil it expects to find, given this budget.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="last-para">Linear programs also are useful for modeling and solving graph and combinatorial problems, such as ones that appear in this textbook. We have already seen a special case of linear programming used to solve systems of difference constraints in <a href="DDU0151.html#1809" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 24.4</a>. In <a href="DDU0188.html#2410" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 29.2</a>, we shall study how to formulate several graph and network-flow problems as linear programs. In <a href="DDU0239.html#3224" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Section 35.4</a>, we shall use linear programming as a tool to find an approximate solution to another graph problem.</p>
