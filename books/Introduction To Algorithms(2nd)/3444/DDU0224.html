<p class="first-para">Throughout this chapter, we shall refer to three classes of problems: P, NP, and NPC, the latter class being the NP-complete problems. We describe them informally here, and we shall define them more formally later on.</p>
<p class="para">The class P consists of those problems that are solvable in polynomial time. More specifically, they are problems that can be solved in time <i class="emphasis">O</i>(<i class="emphasis">n</i><sup>k</sup>) for some constant <i class="emphasis">k</i>, where <i class="emphasis">n</i> is the size of the input to the problem. Most of the problems examined in previous chapters are in P.</p>
<p class="para">The class NP consists of those problems that are "verifiable" in polynomial time. What we mean here is that if we were somehow given a "certificate" of a solution, then we could verify that the certificate is correct in time polynomial in the size of the input to the problem. For example, in the hamiltonian-cycle problem, given a directed graph <i class="emphasis">G</i> = (<i class="emphasis">V</i>, <i class="emphasis">E</i>), a certificate would be a sequence <span class="unicode">&#12296;</span><i class="emphasis">v</i><sub>1</sub>, <i class="emphasis">v</i><sub>2</sub>, <i class="emphasis">v</i><sub>3</sub>, ..., <i class="emphasis">v</i><sub>|<i class="emphasis">V</i>|</sub><span class="unicode">&#12297;</span> of |<i class="emphasis">V</i>| vertices. It is easy to check in polynomial time that (<i class="emphasis">v</i><sub>i</sub>, <i class="emphasis">v</i><sub>i+1</sub>) <span class="unicode">&isin;</span> <i class="emphasis">E</i> for <i class="emphasis">i</i> = 1, 2, 3, ..., |<i class="emphasis">V</i>| - 1 and that (<i class="emphasis">v</i><sub>|<i class="emphasis">V</i>|</sub>, <i class="emphasis">v</i><sub>1</sub>) <span class="unicode">&isin;</span> <i class="emphasis">E</i> as well. As another example, for 3-CNF satisfiability, a certificate would be an assignment of values to variables. We can easily check in polynomial time that this assignment satisfies the boolean formula.</p>
<p class="para">Any problem in P is also in NP, since if a problem is in P then we can solve it in polynomial time without even being given a certificate. We will formalize this notion later in this chapter, but for now we can believe that P <span class="unicode">&sube;</span> NP. The open question is whether or not P is a proper subset of NP.<a name="3006"></a><a name="IDX-968"></a>
</p>
<p class="para">Informally, a problem is in the class NPC<span class="unicode">-</span>and we refer to it as being <b class="bold"><i class="emphasis">NP-complete</i></b><span class="unicode">-</span>if it is in NP and is as "hard" as any problem in NP. We shall formally define what it means to be as hard as any problem in NP later in this chapter. In the meantime, we will state without proof that if <i class="emphasis">any</i> NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then <i class="emphasis">every</i> NP-complete problem has a polynomial-time algorithm. Most theoretical computer scientists believe that the NP-complete problems are intractable, since given the wide range of NP-complete problems that have been studied to date<span class="unicode">-</span>without anyone having discovered a polynomial-time solution to any of them<span class="unicode">-</span>it would be truly astounding if all of them could be solved in polynomial time. Yet, given the effort devoted thus far to proving that NP-complete problems are intractable<span class="unicode">-</span>without a conclusive outcome<span class="unicode">-</span>we cannot rule out the possibility that the NP-complete problems are in fact solvable in polynomial time.</p>
<p class="last-para">To become a good algorithm designer, you must understand the rudiments of the theory of NP-completeness. If you can establish a problem as NP-complete, you provide good evidence for its intractability. As an engineer, you would then do better spending your time developing an approximation algorithm (see <a href="DDU0234.html#3166" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Chapter 35</a>) or solving a tractable special case, rather than searching for a fast algorithm that solves the problem exactly. Moreover, many natural and interesting problems that on the surface seem no harder than sorting, graph searching, or network flow are in fact NP-complete. Thus, it is important to become familiar with this remarkable class of problems.</p>
