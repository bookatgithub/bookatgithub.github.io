<P class="docText">There are no perfect programs. GNU Emacs is very thoroughly debugged,
but it is certainly possible to find things that
don't work correctly.</P>

<P class="docText">The Free Software Foundation (FSF) welcomes problem reports. However,
they need to be real problem <A NAME="gnu3-APP-C-ITERM-3011"></A><A NAME="gnu3-APP-C-ITERM-3012"></A><A NAME="gnu3-APP-C-ITERM-3013"></A><A NAME="gnu3-APP-C-ITERM-3014"></A>reports; simple differences of opinion
about how something should work are not bugs. If you think that a
certain command should work differently, remember that Emacs has been
around for a long time and has many users; it can't
be changed to satisfy a single user. (On the other hand, in most
cases, you could write some Lisp to change it yourself.) In the
<span class="docEmphasis">GNU Emacs Manual</span>, the FSF publishes some
excellent guidelines for reporting bugs, which we'll
summarize very quickly:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Before you report a bug, see if it's on the list of
known problems. You can view this list by typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-h C-e</span>.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">You most certainly have a bug if you run into some kind of system
error (Emacs dumps core, terminates with a segmentation fault,
crashes, hangs, or does something else antisocial).</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">When reporting bugs, be as specific as possible. A few commands will
help you report exactly what was happening when things went awry.
<span class="docEmphBold">C-h l</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">view-lossage</span>) reports the last 100 or so
keystrokes you made; <span class="docEmphBold">M-x</span> <span class="docEmphBold">open-dribble-file</span>
<span class="docEmphasis">filename</span> saves every keystroke you type in the
specified <span class="docEmphasis">filename</span>.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">The FSF discourages you from trying to interpret bugs in the bug
report. "I did thus-and-such and this
happened" is useful, particularly if the problem is
repeatable; "I think there's a
problem with font handling" doesn't
give any useful information at all.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Always report which version of Emacs you are using. The command
<span class="docEmphBold">M-x emacs-version</span> gives you the
relevant information.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Always report the contents of the file you were editing (if it makes
a difference), the contents of your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file,
which mode you were in, and any Lisp libraries (custom or otherwise)
that you have to load in order to create the problem.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">We will add one very important guideline:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Although we have taken every effort to write a book that is accurate,
we are far from perfect. With that in mind, please <span class="docEmphasis">do
not</span> cite this book as an authority when reporting a bug.
Although we haven't asked, the Free Software
Foundation would be completely justified in rejecting any bug reports
based on a third-party publication. If you suspect a bug, use the
<span class="docEmphasis">GNU Emacs Manual</span> or the help facility to find
out what the command that's giving you trouble is
really supposed to do. In doing so, you may find out that this book
is incorrect; if you do, please report the problem to
<A class="docLink" HREF="mailto:booktech@oreilly.com">booktech@oreilly.com</A>.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">If you do have a bug to report, type <span class="docEmphBold">M-x
report-emacs-bug</span> to send it from within Emacs.
You'll be prompted for a subject line and dropped
into Emacs' interface for sending mail. If mail from
Emacs isn't set up properly, you can email
<A class="docLink" HREF="mailto:emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org">emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org</A>
using your preferred mail client. Be sure to include an
informative subject line that summarizes the problem.</P>
