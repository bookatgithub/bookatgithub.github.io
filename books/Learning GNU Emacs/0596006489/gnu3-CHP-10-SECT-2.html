<P class="docText">It's possible to customize Emacs in just about any
way you can imagine. Almost everything you see on the screen, every
command, keystroke, message, and so on, can be changed. As you may
imagine, most customizations involve the Emacs startup file
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">The previous section <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2677"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2678"></A>discussed the interactive customization
tool, Custom, but left out some of the details on what happens any
time you "save for future
sessions." Custom places the configuration
information in your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file. Some things
simply cannot be done through Custom (yet). Once you get familiar
with the types of statements that go into your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file, you may also just find it easier to
add a line or two directly.</P>

<P class="docText">We should emphasize that using Custom or editing
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> by hand is not an either-or proposition.
When you save options via Custom, it adds its settings to the end of
your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file and warns you not to edit them
by hand. Despite this prohibition, you can easily add your own
customizations to the beginning of that file. To illustrate this,

<P class="docText">You might have a bit of trouble finding the right
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file to work with when
you're first starting out. Emacs actually looks for
a variety of startup files. In order, they are:</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">.emacs.elc</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The byte-compiled Lisp version or your startup file. This is not
editable, but can make startup quicker if you have a big, complex
startup file.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">.emacs.el</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The more formal name for your startup file. You can use Lisp commands
to customize and initialize your entire Emacs environment.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The common name for the startup file. Exactly like the
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs.el</span> file, just without the
<span class="docEmphasis">.el</span> extension. Both are editable.</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">As soon as Emacs finds one of these files, that's
it; then it's on to the next step in startup. You
can't have a <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs.elc</span> for the
big customizations and then a separate <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span>
for the last few. Sorry!</P>

<P class="docText">For all you Emacs users on Microsoft Windows-based systems, you might
bump into a variation of this file that begins with an underscore ( _
) rather than a dot (. ). In the past, the Windows filesystem
required something before the first dot, so
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> was an invalid filename. Consequently,
<span class="docEmphasis">_emacs</span> was adopted. The same order and notes
about the <span class="docEmphasis">.elc</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">.el</span>
variants applies. In modern versions of Windows,
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> is a valid filename and the dot
variations take precedence over the underscore versions.</P>

<P class="docText">Some changes require a <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2679"></A>
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2680"></A>knowledge
of Emacs Lisp programming (see <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-11.html#gnu3-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A>);
others are simple enough without such knowledge. In this chapter, we
cover a variety of useful customizations that require no programming

<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-SECT-2.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.2.2.1 Caveat editor</H5>

<P class="docText">Two important comments concerning <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> files
are in order. First, if you are inserting code into your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file, you may end up putting in something
that causes Emacs to fail or behave strangely. If this happens, you
can invoke Emacs without running your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span>
file: simply invoke Emacs with the command-line option <span class="docEmphBold">-q</span>, and Emacs will not run your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file. (<A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-13.html#gnu3-CHP-13">Chapter 13</A>
gives instructions for starting Emacs from the command-line on
Windows and Mac OS X.) You can then examine the file to figure out
what went wrong.</P>

<P class="docText">The other comment is perhaps the most important piece of advice we
can give you concerning customizing your Emacs environment:
<span class="docEmphasis">steal mercilessly from other users</span>. In
particular, if you are dealing with a messy situation involving a
configuration problem or a subtle point about some specialized mode,
it is possible that some other user has solved the problem(s)
already. This is not dishonest or subversive in any way; rather, it
is <span class="docEmphasis">encouraged</span> by the makers of GNU Emacs, who
would rather software be shared than kept to oneself. Emacs even
provides an easy way to try out other users'
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> files: invoke Emacs with the option
<span class="docEmphBold">-u</span> <span class="docEmphasis">username</span>,
and <span class="docEmphasis">username</span>'s
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file will run instead of yours. (Of
course, this works only with users on multiuser systems.)</P>

<P class="docText">In fact, numerous example <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> files are
available on the Web. (Check out "the very
unofficial" <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> site,
<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.dotemacs.de/">http://www.dotemacs.de/</A>.)</P>



<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-SECT-2.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.2.3 A Sample .emacs File</H4>

<P class="docText">Here's a quick example of a (very) simple
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file:</P>

<PRE>;; Turn on font-lock mode to color text in certain modes 
(global-font-lock-mode t)

;; Make sure spaces are used when indenting code
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The lines beginning with two
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2683"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2684"></A>semicolons
are comments. They're meant to help you understand
what is being configured. Sometimes they also list possible values or
the previous value. You can say anything you want in a
comment—as long as it fits on one line. If you need to spill
over onto a second or third line, just begin each successive line
with ;;.</P>

<P class="docText">Blank lines are ignored. Every other line (that's
not blank or a comment) is considered part of a Lisp program that is
executed to configure your Emacs session. In this example, we first
call the <span class="docEmphBold">global-font-lock-mode</span>
function with an argument of <span class="docEmphBold">t</span>
(true, or "on"). Next we make sure
that using the <span class="docEmphBold">Tab</span> key when writing
code doesn't actually insert a tab character but
uses spaces instead. (This is a good thing to do when writing
code—otherwise your code can come out very messy on systems
that use a different tab width.) We use the <span class="docEmphBold">setq-default</span> function to assign the <span class="docEmphBold">indent-tabs-mode</span> a <span class="docEmphBold">nil</span> (false or
"off") value. Using <span class="docEmphBold">setq-default</span> has the advantage of setting the
default value only—modes that choose to override this value may
still do so.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're a seasoned Lisp programmer, you can do
anything you would normally have access to in Lisp. There are
certainly particular functions and variables you need to know about
to be effective, but it is just a Lisp program.</P>

<P class="docText">For the rest of us, this file mostly consists of blocks of Lisp found
on the Internet or on a colleague's computer. You
edit in your personal values and hope it all works. Really. If you
use Custom to manage all of your configuration changes, you
don't even have to look at
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> unless you want to add your own lines at
the beginning of the file or look at what Custom has done.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.2.3.1 Editing .emacs</H5>

<P class="docText">The great thing about <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2685"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2686"></A>configuring a text editor is that you can
use the editor itself to make the changes. You can visit the
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file just as you would any other file.
The only thing to watch out for is where you are. Some folks put
backup copies of this file in strange places. You want to edit the
file that came from your home directory. If you're
unsure of where you are, you can use the full name
<span class="docEmphasis">~/.emacs</span> which Emacs translates to the proper
directory.</P>

<P class="docText">Note also that <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> is not required. If you
haven't had any reason to customize Emacs, it might
not exist. But you should feel free to create it when
you're ready to start tailoring your environment.
(Making your first change via Custom will also create
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> if it doesn't exist.)</P>

<P class="docText">The best way to deal with this file really is to find an example file
and make small changes to it. Use those <span class="docEmphBold">;;</span> comments liberally. If
you're going to change a line in your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file, make a copy of it first:</P>

<PRE>;; Turn off font-lock
;;(global-font-lock-mode t)
(global-font-lock-mode nil)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">That way you can easily get back to a known, working version of your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file. If things get really bad, just
start over. Rename your current <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file and
then copy and paste small chunks of it at a time.</P>

<P class="docText">For changes required by modules and other packages, the documentation
for those modules usually includes example lines for insertion into
your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span>. For example, the JDEE site includes
a sample <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file that can be used as-is or
appended to an existing file. (And if you want to get fancy, you can
leave the JDEE sample in a separate file and simply include a
<span class="docEmphBold">load-file</span> call from your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file. More on <span class="docEmphBold">load-file</span> can be found in the Elisp
documentation.)</P>
