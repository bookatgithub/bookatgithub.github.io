<P class="docText">You may have heard of Lisp as a
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2736"></A>language
for artificial intelligence (AI). If you aren't into
AI, don't worry. Lisp may have an unusual syntax,
but many of its basic features are just like those of more
conventional languages you may have seen, such as Java or Perl. We
emphasize such features in this chapter. After introducing the basic
Lisp concepts, we proceed by building up various example functions
that you can actually use in Emacs. In order to try out the examples,
you should be familiar with Emacs Lisp mode and Lisp interaction
mode, which were discussed in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-9.html#gnu3-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">The basic elements
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2737"></A>
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2738"></A>in
Lisp you need to be familiar with are functions, variables, and
atoms. Functions are the only <span class="docEmphasis">program units</span> in
Lisp; they cover the notions of procedures, subroutines, programs,
and even operators in other languages.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Functions</span> are defined as lists of the above
entities, usually as lists of calls to other, existing functions. All
functions
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2739"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2740"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2741"></A>have <span class="docEmphasis">return
values</span> (as with Perl functions and non-void Java methods);
a function's return value is simply the value of the
last item in the list, usually the value returned by the last
function called. A function call within another function is
equivalent to a <span class="docEmphasis">statement</span> in other languages,
and we use statement interchangeably with function call in this
chapter. Here is the syntax for function:</P>

<PRE>(<TT><I>function-name</I></TT> <TT><I>argument1</I></TT> <TT><I>argument2</I></TT> ...)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">which is equivalent to this:</P>

<PRE><TT><I>method_name </I></TT>(<TT><I>argument1, argument2,</I></TT> ...);</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">in Java. This syntax is used for
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2742"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2743"></A>all
functions, including those equivalent to arithmetic or comparison
operators in other languages. For example, in order to add 2 and 4 in
Java or Perl, you would use the expression 2 + 4, whereas in Lisp you
would use the following:</P>

<PRE>(+ 2 4)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Similarly, where you would use 4 &gt;= 2 (greater than or equal to),
the Lisp equivalent is:</P>

<PRE>(&gt;= 4 2)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Variables</span> in Lisp are
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2744"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2745"></A>similar
to those in any other language, except that they do not have
<span class="docEmphasis">types</span>. A Lisp variable can assume any type of
value (values themselves do have types, but variables
don't impose restrictions on what they can hold).</P>

<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2754"></A>double quotes;
quote marks and backslashes within strings need to be preceded by a
backslash. For example, "<TT>Jane said, \"See</TT>
<TT>Dick run.\"</TT>" is a legal string.
Strings can be split across multiple lines without any special
syntax. Everything until the closing quote, including all the line
breaks, is part of the string value.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphBold">Booleans</span> use <TT>t</TT>
for true and <TT>nil</TT> for false,
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2755"></A>though
most of the time, if a Boolean value is expected, any
non-<TT>nil</TT> value is assumed to mean true.
<TT>nil</TT> is also used as a null or nonvalue in various
situations, as we will see.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphBold">Symbols</span> are names of things in Lisp,
for <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2756"></A>example, names of variables or

<span class="docEmphasis">name</span> of something instead of its value, and this
is done by preceding the name with a single quote
('). For example, the <span class="docEmphBold">define-key</span> function, described in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-10.html#gnu3-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>, uses the <span class="docEmphasis">name</span> of the
command (as a symbol) rather than the command itself.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">A simple example that ties many of these basic Lisp concepts together
is the function <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span>.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-4">[4]</A></sup> As you may have figured out from previous
chapters, <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span> is a way of assigning

rather than a <span class="docEmphasis">form</span>, which it technically
is.</p></blockquote>

<PRE>(setq auto-save-interval 800)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Notice that <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span> is a function,
unlike in other languages in which special syntax such as
<TT>=</TT> or <TT>:=</TT> is used for assignment.
<span class="docEmphBold">setq</span> takes two arguments: a variable
name and a value. In this example, the variable <span class="docEmphBold">auto-save-interval</span> (the number of keystrokes
between auto-saves) is set to the value <TT>800</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">setq</span> can actually be used to assign

<TT><I>     theothervar theothervalue</I></TT><span class="docEmphBold">)</span></PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The return value of <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span> is simply
the last value assigned, in this case
<TT><I>theothervalue</I></TT>. You can set the values of
variables in other ways, as we'll see, but <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span> is the most widely applicable.</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-SECT-1.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">11.1.2 Defining Functions</H4>

<P class="docText">Now it's time for <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2757"></A>
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2758"></A>an
example of a simple function definition. Start Emacs without any
arguments; this puts you into the <TT>*scratch*</TT>
buffer, an empty buffer in Lisp interaction mode (see <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-9.html#gnu3-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>), so that you can actually try this and
subsequent examples.</P>

<P class="docText">Before we get to the example, however, some more comments on Lisp
syntax are necessary. First, you will notice that the dash
(<TT>-</TT>) is used as a
"break" character to separate words
in names of variables, functions, and so on. This practice is simply
a widely used Lisp programming convention; thus the dash takes the
place of the underscore (<TT>_</TT>) in languages like C
and Ada. A more important issue has to do with all of the parentheses
in Lisp code. Lisp is an <span class="docEmphasis">old</span> language that was
designed before anyone gave much thought to language syntax (it was
still considered amazing that you could use any language other than
the native processor's binary instruction set), so
its syntax is not exactly programmer-friendly. Yet
Lisp's heavy use of lists—and thus its heavy
use of parentheses—has its advantages, as
we'll see toward the end of this chapter.</P>

<P class="docText">The main problem a programmer faces is how to keep all the
parentheses balanced properly. Compounding this problem is the usual
programming convention of putting multiple right parentheses at the
end of a line, rather than the more readable technique of placing
each right parenthesis directly below its matching left parenthesis.
Your best defense against this is the support the Emacs Lisp modes
give you, particularly the <span class="docEmphBold">Tab</span> key
for proper indentation and the flash-matching-parenthesis feature.</P>

<P class="docText">Now we're ready for our example function. Suppose
you are a student or journalist who needs to keep track of the number
of words in a paper or story you are writing. Emacs has no built-in
way of counting the number of words in a buffer, so
we'll write a Lisp function that does the job:</P>

<PRE>
1  (defun count-words-buffer ( )
2    (let ((count 0))
3      (save-excursion
4        (goto-char (point-min))
5        (while (&lt; (point) (point-max))
6          (forward-word 1)
7          (setq count (1+ count)))
8        (message "buffer contains %d words." count))))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Let's go through this function line by line and see
what it does. (Of course, if you are trying this in Emacs,
don't type the line numbers in.)</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">defun</span> on line 1 defines the
function by its name and arguments. Notice that <span class="docEmphBold">defun</span> is itself a function—one that,
when called, defines a new function. (<span class="docEmphBold">defun</span> returns the name of the function
defined, as a symbol.) The function's arguments
appear as a list of names inside parentheses; in this case, the
function has no arguments. Arguments can be made
<span class="docEmphasis">optional</span> by preceding them with the keyword
<span class="docEmphBold">&amp;optional</span>. If an argument is
optional and not supplied when the function is called, its value is
assumed to be <TT>nil</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Line 2 contains a <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> construct,
whose general form is:</P>

<PRE>(let ((<TT><I>var1 value</I></TT>1) (var2 value2) ... )
  <TT><I>statement-block</I></TT>)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The first thing <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> does is define
the variables <TT>var1</TT>, <TT>var2</TT>, etc.,
and set them to the initial values <TT>value1</TT>,
<TT>value2</TT>, etc. Then <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> executes the <span class="docEmphasis">statement
block</span>, which is a sequence of function calls or values,
just like the body of a function.</P>

<P class="docText">It is useful to think of <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> as
doing three things:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Defining (or declaring) a list of variables</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Setting the variables to initial values, as if with <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span></P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Creating a block in which the variables are known; the <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> block is known as the
<span class="docEmphasis">scope</span> of the variables</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">If a <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> is used to define a
variable, its value can be reset later within the <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> block with <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span>. Furthermore, a variable defined with
<span class="docEmphBold">let</span> can have the same name as a
global variable; all <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span>s on that
variable within the <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> block act on
the local variable, leaving the global variable undisturbed. However,
a <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span> on a variable that is not
defined with a <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> affects the
global environment. It is advisable to avoid using global variables
as much as possible because their names might conflict with those of
existing global variables and therefore your changes might have
unexpected and inexplicable side effects later on.</P>

<P class="docText">So, in our example function, we use <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> to define the local variable <span class="docEmphBold">count</span> and initialize it to 0. As we will see,
this variable is used as a loop counter.</P>

<P class="docText">Lines 3 through 8 are the statements within the <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> block. The first of these calls the
built-in Emacs function <span class="docEmphBold">save-excursion</span>, which is a way of being
polite. The function is going to move the cursor around the buffer,
so we don't want to disorient the user by jumping
them to a strange place in their file just because they asked for a
word count. Calling <span class="docEmphBold">save-excursion</span>
tells Emacs to remember the location of cursor at the beginning of
the function, and go back there after executing any statements in its
body. Notice how <span class="docEmphBold">save-excursion</span> is
providing us with capability similar to <span class="docEmphBold">let</span>; you can think of it as a way of making
the cursor location itself a local variable.</P>

<P class="docText">Line 4 calls <span class="docEmphBold">goto-char</span>. The argument
to <span class="docEmphBold">goto-char</span> is a (nested) function
call to the built-in function <span class="docEmphBold">point-min</span>. As we have mentioned before,
<span class="docEmphasis">point</span> is Emacs's internal name
for the position of the cursor, and we'll refer to
the cursor as point throughout the remainder of this chapter.
<span class="docEmphBold">point-min</span> returns the value of the
first character position in the current buffer, which is almost
always 1; then, <span class="docEmphBold">goto-char</span> is called
with the value 1, which has the effect of moving point to the
beginning of the buffer.</P>

<P class="docText">The next line sets up a <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> loop;
Java and Perl have a similar construct. The <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> construct has the general form</P>

<PRE>   (while <TT><I>condition</I></TT>     <TT><I>statement-block</I></TT>)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Like <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">save-excursion</span>, <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> sets up another statement block.
<span class="docEmphBold">condition</span> is a value (an atom, a
variable, or a function returning a value). This value is tested; if
it is <TT>nil</TT>, the condition is considered to be
false, and the <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> loop
terminates. If the value is other than <TT>nil</TT>, the
condition is considered to be true, the statement block gets
executed, the condition is tested again, and the process repeats.</P>

<P class="docText">Of course, it is possible to write an infinite loop. If you write a
Lisp function with a <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> loop and
try running it, and your Emacs session hangs, chances are that you
have made this all-too-common mistake; just type <span class="docEmphBold">C-g</span> to abort it.</P>

<P class="docText">In our sample function, the condition is the function
<TT>&lt;</TT>, which is a less-than function with two
arguments, analogous to the &lt; operator in Java or Perl. The first
argument is another function that returns the current character
position of point; the second argument returns the maximum character
position in the buffer, that is, the length of the buffer. The
function <TT>&lt;</TT> (and other relational functions)
return a Boolean value, <TT>t</TT> or
<TT>nil</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">The loop's statement block consists of two
statements. Line 6 moves point forward one word (i.e., as if you had
typed <span class="docEmphBold">M-f</span>). Line 7 increments the
loop counter by 1; the function <TT>1+</TT> is shorthand
for <TT>(+ 1 variable-name)</TT>. Notice that the third
right parenthesis on line 7 matches the left parenthesis preceding
<span class="docEmphBold">while</span>. So, the <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> loop causes Emacs to go through the
current buffer a word at a time while counting the words.</P>

<P class="docText">The final statement in the function uses the built-in function
<span class="docEmphBold">message</span> to print a message in the
minibuffer saying how many words the buffer contains. The form of the
<span class="docEmphBold">message</span> function will be familiar to
C programmers. The first argument to <span class="docEmphBold">message</span> is a format string, which contains
text and special formatting instructions of the form
<TT>%</TT><TT><I>x</I></TT>, where
<TT><I>x</I></TT> is one of a few possible letters. For
each of these instructions, in the order in which they appear in the
format string, <TT>message</TT> reads the next argument and
tries to interpret it according to the letter after the percent sign.

message, double check that your function looks exactly like the
example and that you haven't typed in the line
numbers, and try again.)</P>

<P class="docText">Once the function is defined, you can execute it by typing <span class="docEmphBold">(count-words-buffer)</span> on its own line in your
Lisp interaction window, and once again typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-j</span> after the closing parenthesis.</P>

<P class="docText">Now that you can execute the function correctly from a Lisp
interaction window, try executing the function with <span class="docEmphBold">M-x</span>, as with any other Emacs command. Try
typing <span class="docEmphBold">M-x count-words-buffer Enter</span>:
you will get the error message <TT>[No match]</TT>. (You
can type <span class="docEmphBold">C-g</span> to cancel this failed
attempt.) You get this error message because you need to
"register" a function with Emacs to
make it available for interactive use. The function to do this is
<span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span>, which has the form:</P>

<P class="docText">This statement should be the first in a function, that is, right
after the line containing the <span class="docEmphBold">defun</span>

<span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span> causes Emacs to register
the function as a command and to prompt the user for the arguments
declared in the <span class="docEmphBold">defun</span> statement. The
prompt string is optional.</P>

<P class="docText">The prompt string has a special format: for each argument you want to

<P class="docText">With the <span class="docEmphBold">b</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">f</span> options, Emacs signals an error if the
buffer or file given does not already exist. Another useful option to
<span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span> is <span class="docEmphBold">r</span>, which we will see later. There are many
other option letters; consult the documentation for function
<span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span> for the details. The
rest of each section is the actual prompt that appears in the
minibuffer.</P>

<P class="docText">The way <span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span> is used to fill
in function arguments is somewhat complicated and best explained
through an example. A simple example is in the function <span class="docEmphBold">goto-percent</span>, which we will see shortly. It
contains the statement</P>

<PRE>(interactive "nPercent: ")</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <TT>n</TT> in the prompt string tells Emacs to prompt
for an integer; the string <TT>Percent</TT>: appears in the
minibuffer.</P>

<P class="docText">As a slightly more complicated example, let's say we
want to write our own version of the <span class="docEmphBold">replace-string</span> command.
Here's how we would do the prompting:</P>

<PRE>(defun replace-string (from to)
  (interactive "sReplace string: \nsReplace string %s with: ")
  ...)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The prompt string consists of two sections, <TT>sReplace
string</TT>: and <TT>sReplace string</TT> <TT>%s
with</TT>:, separated by a Newline. The initial
<TT>s</TT> in each means that a string is expected; the
<TT>%s</TT> is a formatting operator (as in the previous
<span class="docEmphBold">message</span> function) that Emacs
replaces with the user's response to the first
prompt. When applying formatting operators in a prompt, it is as if
<span class="docEmphBold">message</span> has been called with a list
of all responses read so far, so the first formatting operator is
applied to the first response, and so on.</P>

<P class="docText">When this command is invoked, first the prompt <TT>Replace
string</TT>: appears in the minibuffer. Assume the user types
<TT><B>fred</B></TT> in response. After the user presses
<span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span>, the prompt <TT>Replace
fred with</TT>: appears. The user types the replacement string
and presses <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span> again.</P>

<P class="docText">The two strings the user types are used as values of the function
arguments <span class="docEmphBold">from</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">to</span> (in that order), and the command runs to
completion. Thus, <span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span>
supplies values to the function's arguments in the
order of the sections of the prompt string.</P>

<P class="docText">The use of <span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span> does not
preclude calling the function from other Lisp code; in this case, the
calling function needs to supply values for all arguments. For
example, if we were interested in calling our version of <span class="docEmphBold">replace-string</span> from another Lisp function that
needs to replace all occurrences of
"Bill" with
"Deb" in a file, we would use</P>

<PRE>(replace-string "Bill" "Deb")</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The function is not being called interactively in this case, so the
<span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span> statement has no effect;
the argument <span class="docEmphBold">from</span> is set to
"Bill," and <span class="docEmphBold">to</span> is set to
"Deb."</P>

<P class="docText">Getting back to our <span class="docEmphBold">count-words-buffer</span> command: it has no
arguments, so its <span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span>
command does not need a prompt string. The final modification we want
to make to our command is to add a <span class="docEmphasis">documentation
string</span> (or <span class="docEmphasis">doc string</span> for short),
which is shown by online help facilities such as <span class="docEmphBold">describe-function</span> (<span class="docEmphBold">C-h
f</span>). Doc strings are normal Lisp strings; they are optional
and can be arbitrarily many lines long, although, by convention, the
first line is a terse, complete sentence summarizing the
command's functionality. Remember that any double
quotes inside a string need to be preceded by backslashes.</P>

<P class="docText">With all of the fixes taken into <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2767"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2768"></A>account, the complete function looks
like this:</P>

<PRE>(defun count-words-buffer ( )
  "Count the number of words in the current buffer; 
print a message in the minibuffer with the result."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((count 0))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (&lt; (point) (point-max))
        (forward-word 1)
        (setq count (1+ count)))
      (message "buffer contains %d words." count))))</PRE><BR>
