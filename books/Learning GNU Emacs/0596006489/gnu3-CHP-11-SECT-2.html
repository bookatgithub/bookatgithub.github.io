<P class="docText">It may seem inefficient or syntactically ugly to use functions for
everything. However, one of the main merits of Lisp is that the core
of the language is small and easy to interpret efficiently. In
addition, the syntax is not as much of a problem if you have support
tools such as Emacs's Lisp modes to help you.</P>

<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-SECT-2.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">11.2.1 Statement Blocks</H4>

<P class="docText">We have seen that a
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2772"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2773"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2774"></A>statement block can be defined
using the <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> function. We also saw
that <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">save-excursion</span> include statement blocks. Other
important constructs also define statement blocks: <span class="docEmphBold">progn</span> and other forms of <span class="docEmphBold">let</span>.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">progn</span>, the most basic, has the form:</P>

<PRE>   (progn
     <TT><I>statement-block</I></TT>)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">progn</span> is a simple way of making a
block of statements look like a single one, somewhat like the curly
braces of Java or the <TT>begin</TT> and
<TT>end</TT> of Pascal. The value returned by <span class="docEmphBold">progn</span> is the value returned by the last
statement in the block. <span class="docEmphBold">progn</span> is
especially useful with control structures like <span class="docEmphBold">if</span> (see the following discussion) that, unlike
<span class="docEmphBold">while</span>, do not include statement
blocks.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> function has other forms as
well. The simplest is:</P>

<PRE>   (let (<TT><I>var1 var2</I></TT> <span class="docEmphBold">..</span>.)
     <TT><I>statement-block</I></TT>)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">In this case, instead of a list of
<TT>(</TT><TT><I>var
value</I></TT><TT>)</TT> pairs, there is simply a list
of variable names. As with the other form of let, these become local
variables accessible in the statement block. However, instead of
initializing them to given values, they are all just initialized to
<TT><B>nil</B></TT>. You can actually mix both forms within
the same <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> statement, for example:</P>

<PRE>   (let (<TT><I>var1</I></TT> (var2 value2) var3 ...)
     <TT><I>statement-block</I></TT>)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">In the form of <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> we saw first, the
initial values for the local variables can be function calls
(remember that all functions return values). All such functions are
evaluated before any values are assigned to variables. However, there
may be cases in which you want the values of some local variables to
be available for computing the values of others. This is where
<span class="docEmphBold">let*</span>, the final version of <span class="docEmphBold">let</span>, comes in. <span class="docEmphBold">let*</span> steps through its assignments in order,
assigning each local variable a value before moving on to the next.</P>

<P class="docText">For example, let's say we want to write a function
<span class="docEmphBold">goto-percent</span> that allows you to go
to a place in the current buffer expressed as a percentage of the
text in the buffer. Here is one way to write this function:</P>

<PRE>(defun goto-percent (pct)
  (interactive "nGoto percent: ")
  (let* ((size (point-max))
        (charpos (/ (* size pct) 100)))
    (goto-char charpos)))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">As we saw earlier, the <span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span>
function is used to prompt users for values of arguments. In this
case, it prompts for the integer value of the argument <span class="docEmphBold">pct</span>. Then the <span class="docEmphBold">let*</span> function initializes <span class="docEmphBold">size</span> to the size of the buffer in characters,
then uses that value to compute the character position <span class="docEmphBold">charpos</span> that is <span class="docEmphBold">pct</span> (percent) of the buffer's
size. Finally, the call of <span class="docEmphBold">goto-char</span>
causes point to be moved to that character position in the current
window.</P>

<P class="docText">The important thing to notice is that if we had used <span class="docEmphBold">let</span> instead of <span class="docEmphBold">let*</span>, the value of <span class="docEmphBold">size</span> would not be available when computing the
value of <span class="docEmphBold">charpos</span>. <span class="docEmphBold">let*</span> can also be used in the
<TT>(</TT><TT><I>var1 var2
...</I></TT><TT>)</TT> format, just like <span class="docEmphBold">let</span>, but there wouldn't be
any point in doing so.</P>

<P class="docText">We should also note that a more efficient way to write <span class="docEmphBold">goto-percent</span> is this:</P>

<PRE>(defun goto-percent (pct)
  (interactive "nPercent: ")
  (goto-char (/ (* pct (point-max)) 100)))</PRE><BR>



<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-SECT-2.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">11.2.2 Control Structures</H4>

<P class="docText">We already saw that the <span class="docEmphBold">while</span>
function
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2775"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2776"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2777"></A>acts as a control
structure like similar statements in other languages. There are two
other important control structures in Lisp: <span class="docEmphBold">if</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">cond</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">if</span> function has the form:</P>

<PRE>   (if <TT><I>condition</I></TT> <TT><I>true-case</I></TT> <TT><I>false-block</I></TT>)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Here, the condition is evaluated; if it is non-<span class="docEmphBold">nil</span>, <TT><I>true-case</I></TT> is
evaluated; if <span class="docEmphBold">nil</span>,
<TT><I>false-block</I></TT> is evaluated. Note that
<TT><I>true-case</I></TT> is a single statement whereas
<TT><I>false-block</I></TT> is a statement block;
<TT><I>false-block</I></TT> is optional.</P>

<P class="docText">As an example, let's suppose we're
writing a function that performs some complicated series of edits to
a buffer and then reports how many changes it made.
We're perfectionists, so we want the status report
to be properly pluralized, that is to say "made 53
changes" or "made 1
change." This is a common enough programming need
that we decide to write a general-purpose function to do it so that
we can use it in other projects too.</P>

<P class="docText">The function takes two arguments: the word to be pluralized (if
necessary) and the count to be displayed (which determines whether
it's necessary).</P>

<PRE>(defun pluralize (word count)
  (if (= count 1)
      word
    (concat word "s")))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The condition in the <span class="docEmphBold">if</span> clause tests
to see if <span class="docEmphBold">count</span> is equal to 1. If
so, the first statement gets executed. Remember that the
"true" part of the <span class="docEmphBold">if</span> function is only one statement, so
<span class="docEmphBold">progn</span> would be necessary to make a
statement block if we wanted to do more than one thing. In this case,
we have the opposite extreme; our
"true" part is a single variable,
<span class="docEmphBold">word</span>. Although this looks strange,
it is actually a very common Lisp idiom and worth getting used to.
When the condition block is true, the value of <span class="docEmphBold">word</span> is evaluated, and this value becomes the
value of the entire <span class="docEmphBold">if</span> statement.
Because that's the last statement in our function,
it is the value returned by <span class="docEmphBold">pluralize</span>. Note that this is exactly the
result we want when <span class="docEmphBold">count</span> is 1: the
value of <span class="docEmphBold">word</span> is returned unchanged.</P>

<P class="docText">The remaining portion of the <span class="docEmphBold">if</span>
statement is evaluated when the condition is false, which is to say,
when <span class="docEmphBold">count</span> has a value other than 1.
This results in a call to the built-in <span class="docEmphBold">concat</span> function, which concatenates all its
arguments into a single string. In this case it adds an
"s" at the end of the word
we've passed in. Again, the result of this
concatenation becomes the result of the <span class="docEmphBold">if</span> statement and the result of our <span class="docEmphBold">pluralize</span> function.</P>

<P class="docText">If you type it in and try it out, you'll see results
like this:</P>

<PRE><B>(pluralize "goat" 5)</B>
"goats"

<B>(pluralize "change" 1)</B>
"change"</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Of course, this function can be tripped up easily enough. You may
have tried something like this already:</P>

<PRE><B>(pluralize "mouse" 5)</B>
"mouses"</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">To fix this, we'd need to be able to tell the
function to use an alternate plural form for tricky words. But it
would be nice if the simple cases could remain as simple as they are
now. This is a good opportunity to use an optional parameter. If
necessary, we supply the plural form to use; if we
don't supply one, the function acts as it did in its
first incarnation. Here's how we'd
achieve that:</P>

<PRE>(defun pluralize (word count &amp;optional plural)
  (if (= count 1)
      word
    (if (null plural)
        (concat word "s")
      plural)))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The "else" part of our code has
become another <span class="docEmphBold">if</span> statement. It uses
the <span class="docEmphBold">null</span> function to check whether
we were given the <span class="docEmphBold">plural</span> parameter
or not. If <span class="docEmphBold">plural</span> was omitted, it
has the value <span class="docEmphBold">nil</span> and the <span class="docEmphBold">null</span> function returns <span class="docEmphBold">t</span> if its argument is <span class="docEmphBold">nil</span>. So this logic reads "if
<span class="docEmphBold">b</span> was missing, just add an <span class="docEmphBold">s</span> to <span class="docEmphBold">word</span>;
otherwise return the special <span class="docEmphBold">plural</span>
value we were given."</P>

<P class="docText">This gives us results like this:</P>

<PRE><B>(pluralize "mouse" 5)</B>
"mouses"
<B>(pluralize "mouse" 5 "mice")</B>
"mice"
<B>(pluralize "mouse" 1 "mice")</B>
"mouse"</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">A more general conditional control structure is the <span class="docEmphBold">cond</span> function, which has the following form:</P>

<PRE>   (cond
    (<TT><I>condition1</I></TT>     <TT><I>statement-block1</I></TT>)
    (<TT><I>condition2</I></TT>     <TT><I>statement-block2</I></TT>)
    <span class="docEmphBold">..</span>.)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Java and Perl programmers can think of this as a sequence of
<span class="docEmphasis">if then else if then else if</span> . . . , or as a
kind of generalized switch statement. The conditions are evaluated in
order, and when one of them evaluates to non-<TT>nil</TT>,
the corresponding statement block is executed; the <span class="docEmphBold">cond</span> function terminates and returns the last
value in that statement block.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-5">[5]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-5">[5]</A></sup> Statement blocks are
actually optional; some programmers like to omit the final statement
block, leaving the final
"condition" as an
"otherwise" clause to be executed
if all of the preceding conditions evaluate to
<TT>nil</TT>. If the statement block is omitted, the value
returned by <TT>cond</TT> is simply the value of the
condition.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">We can use <span class="docEmphBold">cond</span> to give a more
folksy feel to our hypothetical status reporter now that
it's pluralizing nicely. Instead of reporting an
actual numeric value for the number of changes, we could have it say
<span class="docEmphasis">no</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">one</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">two</span>, or <span class="docEmphasis">many</span> as
appropriate. Again we'll write a general function to
do this:</P>

<PRE>(defun how-many (count)

<P class="docText">The first conditional
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2778"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2779"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2780"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2781"></A>expression introduces a new
primitive Lisp function, <span class="docEmphBold">zerop</span>. It
checks whether its argument is zero, and returns <TT>t</TT>
(true) when it is. So when <span class="docEmphBold">count</span> is
zero, the <span class="docEmphBold">cond</span> statement takes this
first branch, and our function returns the value <span class="docEmphBold">no</span>. This strange function name bears a little
explanation. It is pronounced
"zero-pee" and is short for
"zero predicate." In the realm of
mathematical logic from which Lisp evolved, a predicate is a function
that returns true or false based on some attribute of its argument.
Lisp has a wide variety of similar predicate functions, with
structurally related names. When you run into the next one,
you'll understand it. (Of course, you might now
expect the <span class="docEmphBold">null</span> function we
introduced in the previous example to be called
"<span class="docEmphBold">nilp</span>" instead.
Nobody's perfectly consistent.)</P>

written the first one using the same structure, but then
we'd have missed out on an opportunity for a
digression into Lisp trivia!</P>
