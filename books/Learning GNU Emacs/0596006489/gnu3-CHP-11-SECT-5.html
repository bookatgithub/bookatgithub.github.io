<P class="docText">After you get comfortable <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2826"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2827"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2828"></A>with
Emacs Lisp programming, you may find that that
"little extra something" you want
Emacs to do takes the form of a major mode. In previous chapters, we
covered major modes for text entry, word processor input, and
programming languages. Many of these modes are quite complicated to
program, so we'll provide a simple example of a
major mode, from which you can learn the concepts needed to program
your own. Then, in the following section, you will learn how you can
customize existing major modes without changing any of the Lisp code
that implements them.</P>

<P class="docText">We'll develop Calculator mode, a major mode for a
calculator whose functionality will be familiar to you if you have
used the Unix <span class="docEmphasis">dc</span> (desk calculator) command. It
is a Reverse Polish (stack-based) calculator of the type made popular
by Hewlett-Packard. After explaining some of the principal components
of major modes and some interesting features of the calculator mode,
we will give the mode's complete Lisp code.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">11.5.1 Components of a Major Mode</H4>

<P class="docText">A major mode has various
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2829"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2830"></A>components
that integrate it into Emacs. Some are:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">symbol</span> that is the name of
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2831"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2832"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2833"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2834"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2835"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2836"></A>the function that implements the mode</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">name</span> of the mode that appears in the mode
line in parentheses</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">local</span> <I>keymap</I> that
defines key bindings for commands in the mode</P></LI><LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Variables</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">constants</span>
known only within the Lisp code for the mode</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">The special <span class="docEmphasis">buffer</span> the mode may use</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Let's deal with these in order. The mode symbol is
set by assigning the name of the function that implements the mode to
the global variable <span class="docEmphBold">major-mode</span>, as
in:</P>

<PRE>(setq major-mode 'calc-mode)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Similarly, the mode name is set by assigning an appropriate string to
the global variable <TT>mode-name</TT>, as in:</P>

<PRE>(setq mode-name "Calculator")</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The local keymap is defined using functions discussed in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-10.html#gnu3-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>. In the case of the calculator mode, there
is only one key sequence to bind (<span class="docEmphBold">C-j</span>), so we use a special form of the
<span class="docEmphBold">make-keymap</span> command called <span class="docEmphBold">make-sparse-keymap</span> that is more efficient with
a small number of key bindings. To use a keymap as the local map of a
mode, we call the function <span class="docEmphBold">use-local-map</span>, as in:</P>

<PRE>(use-local-map calc-mode-map)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">As we just saw, variables can be defined by using
<TT>setq</TT> to assign a value to them, or by using
<span class="docEmphBold">let</span> to define local variables within
a function. The more "official" way
to define variables is the <span class="docEmphBold">defvar</span>
function, which allows documentation for the variable to be
integrated into online help facilities such as <span class="docEmphBold">C-h v</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">describe-variable</span>). The format is the
following:</P>

<PRE>(defvar <TT><I>varname initial-value</I></TT> "<TT><I>description of the variable</I></TT>")</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">A variation on this is <TT>defconst</TT>, with which you
can define constant values (that never change). For example:</P>

<PRE>(defconst calc-operator-regexp "[-+*/%]"
  "Regular expression for recognizing operators.")</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">defines the regular expression to be used in searching for arithmetic
operators. As you will see, we use the <span class="docEmphBold">calc-</span> as a prefix for the names of all
functions, variables, and constants that we define for the calculator
mode. Other modes use this convention; for example, all names in C++
mode begin with <TT>c++-</TT>. Using this convention is a
good idea because it helps avoid potential name clashes with the
thousands of other functions, variables, and so on in Emacs.</P>

<P class="docText">Making variables local to the mode is also desirable so that they are
known only within a buffer that is running the mode.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-8">[8]</A></sup> To do this,
use the <span class="docEmphBold">make-local-variable</span>
function, as in:</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-8">[8]</A></sup> Unfortunately, because such variables are defined before they
are made local to the mode, there is still a problem with name
clashes with global variables. Therefore, it is still important to
use names that aren't already used for global
variables. A good strategy for avoiding this is to use variable names
that start with the name of the mode.</p></blockquote>

<PRE>(make-local-variable 'calc-stack)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Notice that the name of the variable, not its value, is needed;
therefore a single quote precedes the variable name, turning it into
a symbol.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, various major modes use special buffers that are not
attached to files. For example, the <span class="docEmphBold">C-x
C-b</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">list-buffers</span>)
command creates a buffer called <TT>*Buffer</TT>
<TT>List*</TT>. To create a buffer in a new window, use the
<span class="docEmphBold">pop-to-buffer</span> function, as in:</P>

<PRE>(pop-to-buffer "*Calc*")</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">There are a couple of useful variations on <span class="docEmphBold">pop-to-buffer</span>. We won't use
them in our mode example, but they are handy in other circumstances.</P>

<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2837"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2838"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2839"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2840"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2841"></A>calculator uses a
data structure called a <span class="docEmphasis">stack</span>. Think of a stack
as being similar to a spring-loaded dish stack in a cafeteria. When
you enter a number into a RPN calculator, you
<span class="docEmphasis">push</span> it onto the stack. When you apply an
operator such as plus or minus, you <span class="docEmphasis">pop</span> the top
two numbers off the stack, add or subtract them, and push the result
back on the stack.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">list</span>, a fundamental concept of Lisp, is a
natural for implementing stacks. The list is the main concept that
sets Lisp apart from other programming languages. It is a data
structure that has two parts: the <span class="docEmphasis">head</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">tail</span>. These are known in Lisp jargon, for purely
historical reasons, as <span class="docEmphBold">car</span> and
<span class="docEmphBold">cdr</span> respectively. Think of these
terms as "the first thing in the
list" and "the rest of the
list." The functions <span class="docEmphBold">car</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">cdr</span>,
when given a list argument, return the head and tail of it,
respectively.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-9">[9]</A></sup> Two functions are often used for making lists. <span class="docEmphBold">cons</span> (construct) takes two arguments, which
become the head and tail of the list respectively. <span class="docEmphBold">list</span> takes a list of elements and makes them
into a list. For example, this:</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-9">[9]</A></sup> Experienced Lisp programmers should
note that Emacs Lisp does not supply standard contractions like
<TT>cadr</TT>, <TT>cdar</TT>, and so on.</p></blockquote>

<PRE>(list 2 3 4 5)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">makes a list of the numbers from 2 to 5, and this:</P>

<PRE>(cons 1 (list 2 3 4 5))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">makes a list of the numbers from 1 to 5. <span class="docEmphBold">car</span> applied to that list would return
<TT>1</TT>, while <span class="docEmphBold">cdr</span>
would return the list <TT>(2 3 4 5)</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">These concepts are important because stacks, such as that used in the
calculator mode, are easily implemented as lists. To push the value
of <TT>x</TT> onto the stack <span class="docEmphBold">calc-stack</span>, we can just say this:</P>

<PRE>(setq calc-stack (cons x calc-stack))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If we want to get at the value at the top of the stack, the following
returns that value:</P>

<PRE>(car calc-stack)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">To pop the top value off the stack, we say this:</P>

<PRE>(setq calc-stack (cdr calc-stack))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Bear in mind that the elements of a list can be anything, including
other lists. (This is why a list is called a
<span class="docEmphasis">recursive</span> data structure.) In fact (ready to be
confused?) just about everything in Lisp that is not an atom is a
list. This includes functions, which are basically lists of function
name, arguments, and expressions to be evaluated. The idea of
functions as lists will come in handy very soon.</P>

<P class="docText">followed by <span class="docEmphBold">C-j</span>, evaluates (4 * 17)

<P class="docText">The heart of the code for the calculator mode is the functions
<span class="docEmphBold">calc-eval</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">calc-next-token</span>. (See the code at the end of
this section for these.) <span class="docEmphBold">calc-eval</span>
is bound to <span class="docEmphBold">C-j</span> in Calculator mode.
Starting at the beginning of the line preceding <span class="docEmphBold">C-j</span>, it calls <span class="docEmphBold">calc-next-token</span> to grab each
<span class="docEmphasis">token</span> (number, operator, or command letter) in
the line and evaluate it.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">calc-next-token</span> uses a <span class="docEmphBold">cond</span> construct to see if there is a number,
operator, or command letter at point by using the regular expressions
<span class="docEmphBold">calc-number-regexp</span>, <span class="docEmphBold">calc-operator-regexp</span>, and <span class="docEmphBold">calc-command-regexp</span>. According to which
regular expression was matched, it sets the variable <span class="docEmphBold">calc-proc-fun</span> to the name (symbol) of the
function that should be run (either <span class="docEmphBold">calc-push-number</span>, <span class="docEmphBold">calc-operate</span>, or <span class="docEmphBold">calc-command</span>), and it sets
<TT>tok</TT> to the result of the regular expression match.</P>

<P class="docText">In <span class="docEmphBold">calc-eval</span>, we see where the idea
of a function as a list comes in. The <span class="docEmphBold">funcall</span> function reflects the fact that there
is little difference between code and data in Lisp. We can put
together a list consisting of a symbol and a bunch of expressions and
evaluate it as a function, using the symbol as the function name and
the expressions as arguments; this is what <span class="docEmphBold">funcall</span> does. In this case, the following:</P>

<PRE>(funcall calc-proc-fun tok)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">treats the symbol value of <span class="docEmphBold">calc-proc-fun</span> as the name of the function to
be called and calls it with the argument <TT>tok</TT>. Then
the function does one of three things:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">If the token is a number, <span class="docEmphBold">calc-push-number</span> pushes the number onto the
stack.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">If the token is an operator, <span class="docEmphBold">calc-operate</span> performs the operation on the top
two numbers on the stack (see below).</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">If the token is a command, <span class="docEmphBold">calc-command</span> performs the appropriate command.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">The function <span class="docEmphBold">calc-operate</span> takes the
idea of functions as lists of data a step further by converting the
token from the user directly into a function (an arithmetic
operator). This step is accomplished by the function <span class="docEmphBold">read</span>, which takes a character string and
converts it into a symbol. Thus, <span class="docEmphBold">calc-operate</span> uses <span class="docEmphBold">funcall</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">read</span> in combination as follows:</P>

<PRE>(defun calc-operate (tok)
  (let ((op1 (calc-pop))
        (op2 (calc-pop)))
    (calc-push (funcall (read tok) op2 op1))))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This function takes the name of an arithmetic operator (as a string)
as its argument. As we saw earlier, the string <TT>tok</TT>
is a token extracted from the <TT>*Calc*</TT> buffer, in
this case, an arithmetic operator such as <TT>+</TT> or
<TT>*</TT>. The <span class="docEmphBold">calc-operate</span> function pops the top two
arguments off the stack by using the <span class="docEmphBold">pop</span> function, which is similar to the use of
<TT>cdr</TT> earlier. <span class="docEmphBold">read</span>
converts the token to a symbol, and thus to the name of an arithmetic
function. So, if the operator is <TT>+</TT>, then <span class="docEmphBold">funcall</span> is called as here:</P>

<PRE>(funcall '+ op2 op1)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Thus, the function <span class="docEmphBold">+</span> is called with
the two arguments, which is exactly equivalent to simply <span class="docEmphBold">(+ op2 op1)</span>. Finally, the result of the
function is pushed back onto the stack.</P>

<P class="docText">All this voodoo is necessary so that, for example, the user can type
a plus sign and Lisp automatically converts it into a plus function.
We could have done the same thing less elegantly—and less
efficiently—by writing <span class="docEmphBold">calc-operate</span> with a <span class="docEmphBold">cond</span> construct (as in <span class="docEmphBold">calc-next-token</span>), which would look like this:</P>

<PRE>(defun calc-operate (tok)
  (let ((op1 (calc-pop))
        (op2 (calc-pop)))
    (cond ((equal tok "+")
           (+ op2 op1))
          ((equal tok "-")
           (- op2 op1))
          ((equal tok "*")
           (* op2 op1))
          ((equal tok "/")
           (/ op2 op1))
          (t      
           (% op2 op1)))))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The final thing to notice in the calculator mode code is the function
<span class="docEmphBold">calc-mode</span>, which starts the mode. It
creates (and pops to) the <TT>*Calc*</TT> buffer. Then it
kills all existing local variables in the buffer, initializes the
stack to <TT>nil</TT> (empty), and creates the local
variable <span class="docEmphBold">calc-proc-fun</span> (see the
earlier discussion). Finally it sets Calculator mode as the major
mode, sets the mode name, and activates the local keymap.</P>
