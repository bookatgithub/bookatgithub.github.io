<H3 class="docSection1Title">11.6. Customizing Existing Modes</H3>

<P class="docText">Now that you understand <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2849"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2850"></A>some
of what goes into programming a major mode, you may decide you want
to customize an existing one. Luckily, in most cases, you
don't have to worry about changing any
mode's existing Lisp code to do this; you may not
even have to look at the code. All Emacs major modes have
"hooks" for letting you add your
own code to them. Appropriately, these are called
<span class="docEmphasis">mode-hooks</span>. Every built-in major mode in Emacs
has a mode hook called <TT><I>mode-name</I></TT><span class="docEmphBold">-hook</span>, where
<TT><I>mode-name</I></TT> is the name of the mode or the
function that invokes it. For example, C mode has <span class="docEmphBold">c-mode-hook</span>, shell mode has <span class="docEmphBold">shell-mode-hook</span>, etc.</P>

<P class="docText">What exactly is a hook? It is a variable whose value is some Lisp
code to run when the mode is invoked. When you invoke a mode, you run
a Lisp function that typically does many things (e.g., sets up key
bindings for special commands, creates buffers and local variables,
etc.); the last thing a mode-invoking function usually does is run
the mode's hook if it exists. Thus, hooks are
"positioned" to give you a chance
to override anything the mode's code may have set
up. For example, any key bindings you define override the
mode's default bindings.</P>

<P class="docText">We saw earlier that Lisp code can be used as the value of a Lisp
variable; this use comes in handy when you create hooks. Before we
show you exactly how to create a hook, we need to introduce yet
another Lisp primitive function: <span class="docEmphBold">lambda</span>. <span class="docEmphBold">lambda</span> is very much like <span class="docEmphBold">defun</span> in that it is used to define functions;
the difference is that <span class="docEmphBold">lambda</span>
defines functions that don't have names (or, in Lisp
parlance, "anonymous functions").
The format of <span class="docEmphBold">lambda</span> is:</P>

<PRE>(lambda (<TT><I>args</I></TT>) 
  <TT><I>code</I></TT>)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">where <TT><I>args</I></TT> are arguments to the function
and <TT><I>code</I></TT> is the body of the function. To
assign a lambda function as the value of a variable, you need to
"quote" it to prevent it from being
evaluated (run). That is, you use the form:</P>

<PRE>(setq <TT><I>var-name</I></TT> 
      '(lambda ( )
         <TT><I>code</I></TT>))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Therefore, to create code for a mode hook, you could use the form:</P>

<PRE>(setq <TT><I>mode-name</I></TT>-hook
      '(lambda ( )
         <TT><I>code for mode hook</I></TT>))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">However, it's quite possible that the mode you want
to customize already has hooks defined. If you use the
<TT>setq</TT> form, you override whatever hooks already
exist. To avoid this, you can use the function
<TT>add-hook</TT> instead:</P>

<PRE>(add-hook <TT><I>'mode-name</I></TT>-hook
      '(lambda ( )
  <TT><I>code for mode hook</I></TT>))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The most common thing done with mode hooks is to change one or more
of the key bindings for a mode's special commands.
Here is an example: in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-7.html#gnu3-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A> we saw that
picture mode is a useful tool for creating simple line drawings.
Several commands in picture mode set the default drawing direction.
The command to set the direction to
"down," <span class="docEmphBold">picture-movement-down</span>, is bound to <span class="docEmphBold">C-c </span>. (<span class="docEmphBold">C-c</span>
followed by a period). This is not as mnemonic a binding as <span class="docEmphBold">C-c &lt;</span> for <span class="docEmphBold">picture-movement-left</span> or <span class="docEmphBold">C-c ^</span> for <span class="docEmphBold">picture-movement-up</span>, so let's
say you want to make <span class="docEmphBold">C-c v</span> the
binding for <span class="docEmphBold">picture-movement-down</span>
instead. The keymap for picture mode is, not surprisingly, called
<span class="docEmphBold">picture-mode-map</span>, so the code you
need to set this key binding is this:</P>

<PRE>(define-key picture-mode-map "\C-cv" 'picture-movement-down)</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The hook for picture mode is called <span class="docEmphBold">edit-picture-hook</span> (because <span class="docEmphBold">edit-picture</span> is the command that invokes
picture mode). So, to put this code into the hook for picture mode,
the following should go into your <I>.emacs </I>file:</P>

<PRE>(add-hook 'edit-picture-hook
      '(lambda ( )
         (define-key picture-mode-map "\C-cv" 'picture-movement-down)))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This instruction creates a <span class="docEmphBold">lambda</span>
function with the one key binding command as its body. Then, whenever
you enter picture mode (starting with the next time you invoke
Emacs), this binding will be in effect.</P>

<P class="docText">As a slightly more complex example, let's say you
create a lot of HTML pages. You use HTML mode (see <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-8.html#gnu3-CHP-8">Chapter 8</A>), but you find that there are no Emacs
commands that enter standard <TT>head</TT> and
<TT>title</TT> tags, despite the fact that the help text
reminds you of their importance. You want to write your own functions
to insert these strings, and you want to bind them to keystrokes in
HTML mode.</P>

<P class="docText">To do this, you first need to write the functions that insert the tag
strings. The simplest approach would just be to insert the text:</P>

<PRE>(defun html-head ( )
  (interactive)
  (insert "&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;"))

(defun html-title( )
  (interactive)
  (insert "&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;"))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Remember that the calls to <TT>(interactive)</TT> are
necessary so that Emacs can use these functions as user commands.</P>

<P class="docText">The next step is to write code that binds these functions to
keystrokes in HTML mode's keymap, which is called
<span class="docEmphBold">html-mode-map</span>, using the techniques
described in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-10.html#gnu3-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>. Assume you want to bind
these functions to <span class="docEmphBold">C-c C-h</span> (head)
and <span class="docEmphBold">C-c C-t</span> (title). <span class="docEmphBold">C-c</span> is used as a prefix key in many Emacs
modes, such as the language modes we saw in the last chapter. Again,
this is no problem:</P>

<PRE>(define-key html-mode-map"\C-c\C-h" 'html-head)
(define-key html-mode-map"\C-c\C-t" 'html-title))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Finally, you need to convert these lines of Lisp into a value for
<span class="docEmphBold">html-mode-hook</span>. Here is the code to
do this:</P>

<PRE>(add-hook 'html-mode-hook 
      '(lambda ( )
         (define-key html-mode-map"\C-c\C-h" 'html-head)
         (define-key html-mode-map"\C-c\C-t" 'html-title)))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you put this code in your <I>.emacs </I>file,
together with the earlier function definitions, you get the desired
functionality whenever you use HTML mode.</P>

<P class="docText">If you try using these functions, though, you'll
find they have some noticeable drawbacks compared to the other tag
insertion commands in HTML mode. For one thing, while the other
helper commands leave your cursor in between the opening and closing
tags, our insertions leave the cursor after the closing tag, which is
not only inconsistent, but it's much less helpful.
Also, while the other tags you insert can be customized in terms of
your preferred capitalization, or wrapped around existing content in
the document, our simple-minded <span class="docEmphBold">insert</span> calls give us no such capabilities.</P>

<P class="docText">Luckily, it's not hard to add the smarts we want. It
turns out that HTML mode is defined in the file
<span class="docEmphasis">sgml-mode.el</span> (we learned this by applying
help's handy <span class="docEmphBold">describe-function</span> command, <span class="docEmphBold">C-h f</span>, to the mode-defining function HTML
mode. Armed with this knowledge, it was an easy matter to pull up and
study the Lisp code that makes it work using the <span class="docEmphBold">find-library-file</span> utility shown in
"A Treasure Trove of Examples"
earlier in this chapter. A little quick hunting to find a parallel
example revealed that the tag support is implemented using a skeletal
function generator. Without going into too much detail, it turns out
that the code we want to use is this:</P>

<PRE>(define-skeleton html-head
  "HTML document header section."
  nil
  "&lt;head&gt;" _ "&lt;/head&gt;")

(define-skeleton html-title
  "HTML document title."
  nil
  "&lt;title&gt;" _ "&lt;/title&gt;")</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The define-skeleton function sets up the skeletal HTML code to be
inserted, and it does this by writing a Lisp function based on the
template you pass it. Its first argument is the name of the Lisp
function to define, and the next is a documentation string for that
function explaining what it inserts. After that comes an optional
prompt that can be used to customize the content to be inserted. We
don't need any customization, so we leave it as
<TT>nil</TT> to skip the prompt. Finally comes the list of
strings to be inserted, and we mark where we want the cursor to end
up with "<TT>_</TT>". (To
learn more about the way this skeleton system works, invoke <span class="docEmphBold">describe-function</span> on <span class="docEmphBold">insert-skeleton</span>.)</P>

<P class="docText">With these changes, our new commands work just like the other
insertion tools in HTML mode. Even more than the specific Lisp code
that came out of this example, the <span class="docEmphasis">technique</span> we
used to create it is worth learning. If you can develop the skills
and habits involved in tracking down an example from the built-in
libraries that is close to what you want, and digging into how it
works just enough to come up with a variant that solves your problem,
you'll be well on your way to becoming the friendly
Emacs Lisp guru your friends rely on when they need a cool new trick.</P>

<P class="docText">Here is a third example. Let's say you program in C,
and you want a Lisp function that counts the number of C function
definitions in a file. The following function does the trick; it is
somewhat similar to the <span class="docEmphBold">count-lines-buffer</span> example earlier in the
chapter. The function goes through the current buffer looking for
(and counting) C function definitions by searching for
<TT>{</TT> at the beginning of a line (admittedly, this
simplistic approach assumes a particular and rigid C coding style):</P>

<PRE>(defun count-functions-buffer ( )
"Count the number of C function definitions in the buffer."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((count 0))
      (while (re-search-forward "^{" nil t)
        (setq count (1+ count)))
      (message "%d functions defined." count))))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">re-search-forward</span> call in this
function has two extra arguments; the third (last) of these means
"if not found, just return <TT>nil</TT>,
don't signal an error." The second
argument must be set to <TT>nil</TT>, its default, so that
the third argument can be supplied.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-11">[11]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-11">[11]</A></sup> The second
argument to <span class="docEmphBold">re-search-forward</span>—and other search
functions—gives a bound to the search: if given an integer
value <TT><I>n</I></TT> don't search past
character position <TT><I>n</I></TT>. A value of
<TT>nil</TT>, the default, means don't
give the search a bound.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Now assume we want to bind this function to <span class="docEmphBold">C-c
f</span> in C mode. Here is how we would set the value of
<span class="docEmphBold">c-mode-hook</span>:</P>

<PRE>(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 
      '(lambda ( )
         (define-key c-mode-map "\C-cf" 'count-functions-buffer)))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Put this code and the function definition given earlier in your
<I>.emacs</I> file, and this functionality will be
available to you in C mode.</P>

<P class="docText">As a final example of mode hooks, we'll make good on
a promise from the previous chapter. When discussing C++ mode, we
noted that the commands <span class="docEmphBold">c-forward-into-nomenclature</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">c-backward-into-nomenclature</span> are included as
alternatives to <span class="docEmphBold">forward-word</span> and
<span class="docEmphBold">backward-word</span> that treat
<I>WordsLikeThis</I> as three words instead of one, and
that this feature is useful for C++ programmers. The question is how
to make the keystrokes that normally invoke <span class="docEmphBold">forward-word</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">backward-word</span> invoke the new commands instead.</P>

<P class="docText">At first, you might think the answer is simply to create a hook for
C++ mode that rebinds <span class="docEmphBold">M-f</span> and
<span class="docEmphBold">M-b</span>, the default bindings for
<span class="docEmphBold">forward-word</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">backward-word</span>, to the new commands, like this:</P>

<PRE>(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 
      '(lambda ( )
         (define-key c++-mode-map "\ef" 
           'c-forward-into-nomenclature)
         (define-key c++-mode-map "\eb" 
           'c-backward-into-nomenclature)))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">(Notice that we are using <span class="docEmphBold">c++-mode-map</span>, the local keymap for C++ mode,
for our key bindings.) But what if those keys have already been
rebound, or what if <span class="docEmphBold">forward-word</span> and
<span class="docEmphBold">backward-word</span> are also bound to
other keystroke sequences (which they usually are anyway)? We need a
way to find out what keystrokes are bound to these functions, so that
we can reset <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> of them to the new functions.</P>

<P class="docText">Luckily, an obscure function gives us this information, <span class="docEmphBold">where-is-internal</span>. This function implements
the "guts" of the <span class="docEmphBold">where-is</span> help command, which we will see in
<A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-14.html#gnu3-CHP-14">Chapter 14</A>. <span class="docEmphBold">where-is-internal</span> returns a list of keystroke
atoms that are bound to the function given as an argument. We can use
this list in a <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> loop to do all
of the rebinding necessary. Here is the code:</P>

<PRE>(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook
      '(lambda ( )
         (let ((fbinds (where-is-internal 'forward-word))
               (bbinds (where-is-internal 'backward-word)))
           (while fbinds
             (define-key c++-mode-map (car fbinds)
               'c-forward-into-nomenclature)
             (setq fbinds (cdr fbinds)))
           (while bbinds
             (define-key c++-mode-map (car bbinds)
               'c-backward-into-nomenclature)
             (setq bbinds (cdr bbinds))))))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The two lines in the top of the <span class="docEmphBold">let</span>
statement get all of the key bindings of the commands <span class="docEmphBold">forward-word</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">backward-word</span> into the local variables
<span class="docEmphBold">fbinds</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">bbinds</span>, respectively.</P>

<P class="docText">After that, there are two <span class="docEmphBold">while</span>
loops that work like the <span class="docEmphBold">print-stack</span>
function of the calculator mode shown earlier in this chapter. This
use of <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> is a very common Lisp
programming construct: it iterates through the elements of a list by
taking the first element (the <span class="docEmphBold">car</span>),
using it in some way, and deleting it from the list
(<TT>(setq</TT> <TT><I>list</I></TT>
<TT>(cdr</TT>
<TT><I>list</I></TT><TT>)</TT>). The
loop finishes when the list becomes empty (<TT>nil</TT>),
causing the <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> test to fail.</P>

<P class="docText">In this case, the first <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> loop
takes each of the bindings that <span class="docEmphBold">where-is-internal</span> found for <span class="docEmphBold">forward-word</span> and creates a binding in C++
mode's local keymap, <span class="docEmphBold">c++-mode-map</span>, for the new command <span class="docEmphBold">c-forward-into-nomenclature</span>. The second
<span class="docEmphBold">while</span> loop does the same for
<span class="docEmphBold">backward-word</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">c-backward-into-nomenclature</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">The surrounding code installs these loops as a hook to C++ mode, so
that the rebinding takes place only when C++ mode is invoked and is
active only in buffers that are in that mode.</P>

<P class="docText">One final word about hooks: you may have noticed that some of the
mode customizations we have shown in previous chapters include hooks
and others do not. For example, the code in the previous chapter to
set your preferred C or C++ indentation style included a hook:</P>

<PRE>(add-hook 'c-mode-hook
      '(lambda ( )
         (c-set-style "<TT><I>stylename</I></TT>")
         (c-toggle-auto-state)))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">whereas the code that sets an alternative C preprocessor command name
for the <span class="docEmphBold">c-macro-expand</span> command did
not:</P>

<PRE>(setq c-macro-preprocessor "/usr/local/lib/cpp -C")</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">Why is this? Actually, the correct way to customize any mode is
through its hook—for example, the preceding example should
really be:</P>

<PRE>(add-hook 'c-mode-hook
      '(lambda ( )
         (setq c-macro-preprocessor "/usr/local/lib/cpp -C")))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">If you merely want to set values of variables, you can get away
without a hook, but a hook is strictly required if you want to run
functions like <span class="docEmphBold">c-set-style</span> or those
used to bind keystrokes. The precise reason for this dichotomy takes
us into the murky depths of Lisp language design, but
it's essentially as follows.</P>

<P class="docText">Variables that are local to modes, like <span class="docEmphBold">c-macro-preprocessor</span>, do not exist if you
don't invoke the mode in which they are defined. So,
if you aren't editing C or C++ code, then <span class="docEmphBold">c-macro-preprocessor</span> doesn't
exist in your running Emacs, because you haven't
loaded C mode (see below). Yet if your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span>
file contains a <span class="docEmphBold">setq</span> to
set this variable's value, then you call the
variable into existence whether or not you ever use C mode. Emacs can
deal with this: when it loads C mode, it notices that you have
already set the variable's value and does not
override it.</P>

<P class="docText">However, the situation is different for functions. If you put a call
to a mode-local function like <span class="docEmphBold">c-set-style</span> in your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span>
file, then (in most cases) Emacs complains, with the
message <TT>Error in init file</TT>, because it does not
know about this function and thus cannot assume anything about what
it does. Therefore you must attach this function to a hook for C
mode: by the time Emacs runs your hook, it has already loaded the
mode and therefore knows what the function does.</P>

<P class="docText">These examples of hooks are only the briefest indication of how far
you can go in customizing Emacs's major modes. The
best part is that, with hooks, you can do an incredible amount of
customization without touching the code that implements the modes. In
exchange, you should remember, when you do write your own modes, to
think about useful places to put hooks so others can <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2851"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2852"></A>take advantage of
them.</P>
