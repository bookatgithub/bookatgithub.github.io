<H3 class="docSection1Title">11.7. Building Your Own Lisp Library</H3>

<P class="docText">After you have become
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2853"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2854"></A>proficient at Emacs Lisp programming,
you will want a library of Lisp functions and packages that you can
call up from Emacs at will. Of course, you can define a few small
functions in your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file, but if you are
writing bigger pieces of code for more specialized purposes, you will
not want to clutter up your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span>
file—nor will you want Emacs to spend all that time evaluating
the code each time you start it up. The answer is to build your own
Lisp library, analogous to the Lisp directories that come with Emacs
and contain all of its built-in Lisp code. After you have created a
library, you can load whatever Lisp packages you need at a given time
and not bother with the others.</P>

<P class="docText">Creating a library requires two simple steps. First, create a
directory in which your Lisp code will reside. Most people create a
<span class="docEmphasis">elisp</span> subdirectory of their home directory. Lisp
files are expected to have names ending in <span class="docEmphasis">.el</span>
(your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file is an exception). The second
step is to make your directory known to Emacs so that when you try to
load a Lisp package, Emacs knows where to find it. Emacs keeps track
of such directories in the global variable <span class="docEmphBold">load-path</span>, which is a list of strings that are
directory names.</P>

<P class="docText">The initial value for <span class="docEmphBold">load-path</span> is
populated with the names of the Lisp directories that come with
Emacs, e.g., <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/emacs/lisp</span>. You will
need to add the name of your own Lisp directory to <span class="docEmphBold">load-path</span>. One way to make this addition is to
use the Lisp function <span class="docEmphBold">append</span>, which
concatenates any number of list arguments together. For example, if
your Lisp directory is <span class="docEmphasis">~&lt;yourname&gt;/lisp</span>,
you would put the following in your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file:</P>

<PRE>(setq load-path (append load-path (list "~<TT><I>yourname</I></TT>/lisp")))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">The function <span class="docEmphBold">list</span> is necessary
because all of the arguments to <span class="docEmphBold">append</span> must be lists. This line of code must
precede any commands in your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file that
load packages from your Lisp directory.</P>

<P class="docText">When you load a library, Emacs searches directories in the order in
which they appear in <span class="docEmphBold">load-path</span>;
therefore, in this case, Emacs searches its default Lisp directory
first. If you want your directory to be searched first, you should
use the <span class="docEmphBold">cons</span> function described
earlier instead of <span class="docEmphBold">append</span>, as
follows:</P>

<PRE>(setq load-path (cons "~<TT><I>yourname</I></TT>/lisp" load-path))</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">This form is useful if you want to replace one of the standard Emacs
packages with one of your own. For example, you'd
use this form if you've written your own version of
C mode and want to use it instead of the standard package. Notice
that the directory name here is not surrounded by a call to <span class="docEmphBold">list</span> because <span class="docEmphBold">cons</span>'s first argument can be
an atom (a string in this case). This situation is similar to the use
of <span class="docEmphBold">cons</span> for pushing values onto
stacks, as in the calculator mode described earlier.</P>

<P class="docText">If you want Emacs to search the directory you happen to be in at any
given time, simply add <TT>nil</TT> to <span class="docEmphBold">load-path</span>, either by prepending it via
<span class="docEmphBold">cons</span> or by appending it via
<span class="docEmphBold">append</span>. Taking this step is
analogous to putting . in your Unix PATH
environment variable.</P>

<P class="docText">After you have created a private Lisp library and told Emacs where to
find it, you're ready to load and use the Lisp
packages that you've created. There are several ways
of loading Lisp packages into Emacs. The first of these should be
familiar from <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-10.html#gnu3-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Type <span class="docEmphBold">M-x load-library Enter</span> as a
user command; see <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-10.html#gnu3-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Put the line <TT>(load
</TT>"<TT><I>package-name</I></TT>"<TT>)</TT>
within Lisp code. Putting a line like this into your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span><I> </I>file makes Emacs
load the package whenever you start it.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Invoke Emacs with the command-line option <TT><B>"-l</B></TT>
<TT><I>package-name</I></TT><TT><B>"</B></TT>. This
action loads the package <TT><I>package-name</I></TT>.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Put the line <TT>(autoload</TT>
'<TT><I>function</I></TT>
"<TT><I>filename</I></TT>"<TT>)</TT>
within Lisp code (typically in your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span><I> </I>file), as described
in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-10.html#gnu3-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>. This action causes Emacs to load
the package when you execute the given

the option <TT><B>"-f</B></TT>
<TT><I>function-name</I></TT><TT><B>"</B></TT>
which causes Emacs to run the function

<H4 class="docSection2Title">11.7.1 Byte-Compiling Lisp Files</H4>

<P class="docText">After you have created
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2855"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2856"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2857"></A>your Lisp directory, you can make
loading and running your Lisp files more efficient by
<span class="docEmphasis">byte-compiling</span> them, or translating their code
into <span class="docEmphasis">byte code</span>, a more compact, machine-readable
form. Byte-compiling the Lisp file <span class="docEmphasis">filename.el</span>
creates the byte code file <span class="docEmphasis">filename.elc</span>. Byte
code files are typically 40 to 75 percent of the size of their
non-byte-compiled counterparts.</P>

<P class="docText">Although byte-compiled files are more efficient, they are not
strictly necessary. The <span class="docEmphBold">load-library</span>
command, when given the argument <TT><I>filename</I></TT>,
first looks for a file called
<span class="docEmphasis">&lt;filename&gt;.elc</span>. If that
doesn't exist, it tries
<span class="docEmphasis">&lt;filename&gt;.el</span>, that is, the
non-byte-compiled version. If that doesn't exist, it
finally tries just <span class="docEmphasis">&lt;filename&gt;</span>. Thus, you
can byte-compile your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file, which may
result in faster startup if your
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span><I> </I>is large.</P>

<P class="docText">You can byte-compile a single function in a buffer of Lisp code by
placing your cursor anywhere in the function and typing <span class="docEmphBold">M-x compile-defun</span>. You can byte-compile an
entire file of Lisp by invoking <span class="docEmphBold">M-x
byte-compile-file Enter</span> and supplying the filename. If you
omit the <span class="docEmphasis">.el</span> suffix, Emacs appends it and asks
for confirmation. If you have changed the file but have not saved it,
Emacs offers to save it first.</P>

<P class="docText">Then you will see an entertaining little display in the minibuffer as
the byte-compiler does its work: the names of functions being
compiled flash by. The byte-compiler creates a file with the same
name as the original Lisp file but with <TT>c</TT>
appended; thus, <span class="docEmphasis">&lt;filename&gt;.el</span> becomes
<span class="docEmphasis">&lt;filename&gt;.elc</span>, and
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> becomes <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs.elc</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, if you develop a directory with several Lisp files, and you
make changes to some of them, you can use the <span class="docEmphBold">byte-recompile-directory</span> command to recompile
only those Lisp files that have been changed since being
byte-compiled (analogously to the Unix <span class="docEmphBold">make</span> utility). Just type <span class="docEmphBold">M-x byte-recompile-directory</span> <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span> and supply the name of the Lisp
directory or just press <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span> for
the default, which is the current directory.</P>
