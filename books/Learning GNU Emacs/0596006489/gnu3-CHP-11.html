<H2 class="docChapterTitle">Chapter 11. Emacs Lisp Programming</H2>


<P class="docText">If you have been using Emacs for a <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2734"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2735"></A>while and have been taking advantage of
some of its more advanced features, chances are that you have thought
of something useful that Emacs doesn't do. Although
Emacs has hundreds of built-in commands, dozens of packages and
modes, and so on, everyone eventually runs into some functionality
that Emacs doesn't have. Whatever feature you find
missing, you can program using Emacs Lisp.</P>

<P class="docText">Before you dive in, however, note that this chapter is not for
everyone. It is intended for people who have already become
comfortable using Emacs and who have a fair bit of programming
experience, though not necessarily with Lisp <span class="docEmphasis">per
se</span>. If you have no such experience, you may want to skip
this chapter; if there is something specific you would like Emacs to
do, you might try to find a friendly Emacs Lisp hacker to help you
write the necessary code. Or, if you're a little
adventurous, you could skim enough to find the file-template example
and learn how to install it—it gives you some useful features.</P>

<P class="docText">Readers who are building their Lisp skills but don't
necessarily want to read the whole chapter might also want to look
for the "Treasure Trove of
Examples" section in the middle for a useful tool
that can help jumpstart their exploration of the Emacs libraries.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that we do not cover Lisp in its entirety in this chapter. That
would require another large, dense book. Instead, we cover the basics
of the language and other features that are often useful in writing
Emacs code. If you wish to go beyond this chapter, refer to the
<span class="docEmphasis">GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</span>, distributed
with Emacs (choose Help<img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> More Manuals<img src=images/ent/U2192.GIF border=0> Introduction
to Lisp and Emacs Lisp Reference) for details about the specific Lisp
features in Emacs. You may also turn to any of the various Lisp
textbooks<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> available for a solid grounding in the
language itself.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> We recommend <span class="docEmphasis">Lisp</span> by
Patrick Henry Winston and Berthold Klaus Paul Horn (Addison
Wesley).</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Emacs Lisp is a full-blown Lisp implementation;<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-2">[2]</A></sup> thus it is
more than the usual macro or script language found in many text
editors. (One of the authors has written a small expert system
entirely in Emacs Lisp.) In fact, you could even think of Emacs
itself as a Lisp system with lots of built-in functions, many of
which happen to pertain to text manipulation, window management, file
I/O, and other features useful to text editing. The source code for
Emacs, written in C, implements the Lisp interpreter, Lisp
primitives, and only the most basic commands for text editing; a
large layer of built-in Lisp code and libraries on top of that
implements the rest of Emacs's functionality. A
current version of Emacs comes with close to 250,000 lines of Lisp.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-2">[2]</A></sup> Experienced Lisp programmers should note that Emacs Lisp most
closely resembles MacLisp, with a few Common Lisp features added.
More complete Common Lisp emulation can be had by loading the package
<TT>cl</TT> (see Appendix B).</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">This chapter starts with an introduction to the aspects of Lisp that
resemble common programming languages like Java and Perl. These
features are enough to enable you to write many Emacs commands. Then
we deal with how to interface Lisp code with Emacs so that the
functions you write can become Emacs commands. We will see various
built-in Lisp functions that are useful for writing your own Emacs
commands, including those that use regular expressions; we give an
explanation of regular expressions that extends the introduction in
<A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-3.html#gnu3-CHP-3">Chapter 3</A> and is oriented toward Lisp
programming. We then return to the basics of Lisp for a little while,
covering the unique features of the language that have to do with
lists, and show how this chapter's concepts fit
together by presenting a file template system you can install and use
in your own programming or writing projects.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally we show you how to program a simple major mode, illustrating
that this "summit" of Emacs Lisp
programming isn't so hard to scale. After that, you
will see how easy it is to customize Emacs's
built-in major modes without having to change (or even look at) the
code that implements them. We finish the chapter by describing how to
build your own library of Lisp packages.</P>
