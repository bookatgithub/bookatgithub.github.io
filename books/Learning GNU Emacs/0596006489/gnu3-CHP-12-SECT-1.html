<H3 class="docSection1Title">12.1. The Uses of Version Control</H3>

<P class="docText">If you write either large programs or long documents, you have
probably been caught at least once in a situation where
you've made changes that turned out to be a bad
thing, only to be confused and stymied because you
weren't sure exactly how to reverse them and get
back to a <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2858"></A>known good
state. Or, perhaps you've released a program or
document to someone else, then gotten a bug fix or a comment that you
couldn't integrate properly because you
couldn't recover the old version that person was
working with. Perhaps you're a member of a
development or documentation team and have felt the need for some way
to keep change histories, indicating who was responsible for each
change.</P>

<P class="docText">These common kinds of problems can be addressed with a
<span class="docEmphasis">version control system</span>. A version control system
gives you automated help at keeping a change history for a file or
group of files. It allows you to recover any stage in that history,
and it makes getting reports on the differences between versions
easy.</P>

<P class="docText">Today a variety of version control systems are widely available on
machines that run Emacs. Some are commercial, but there are a wealth
of free, open, and powerful choices, and it seems appropriate for our
discussion to focus on these. Historically, Emacs evolved largely in
a Unix environment alongside the SCCS and RCS systems, and its
built-in support for version control reflects their approach and
terminology. Today the most popular by far is CVS (which builds on
RCS, giving it more flexibility and power), and there is a new system
called Subversion that is starting to catch on. Preliminary support
for working with Subversion shipped with Emacs 21.3.5; its
documentation suggests you check the Subversion site, <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</A>, for updates.</P>

<P class="docText">Given that when you need version control, you generally need it very
badly (and you have enough other challenges to occupy your mind),
it's not surprising that most integrated development
environments today offer automated support for these tools. And if
any other IDE does it, by now you can certainly predict that Emacs
does too!</P>

<P class="docText">In this chapter, we'll introduce you to the Emacs
facility called VC, an Emacs Lisp minor mode that makes using version
control systems very easy. VC runs all version control commands for
you (using Emacs' subprocess facilities in the same
way that compiler modes do). VC hides almost all the details of their
interfaces from you; instead, you can trigger most basic version
control operations with a single command, with Emacs correctly
deducing what needs to be done next.</P>

<P class="docText">As noted above, the VC architecture was designed with the behavior of
RCS in mind. So as we explain VC, we'll explain the
RCS terminology and behavior as Emacs presents it. Where needed,
we'll point out key differences in the way CVS
behaves. Subversion, in turn, is being designed as a more modern
version of CVS, and acts like CVS with respect to its interactions
with Emacs.</P>
