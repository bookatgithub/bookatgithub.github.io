<H3 class="docSection1Title">12.8. Individual VC Commands</H3>

<P class="docText">We've already explained what the main command,
<span class="docEmphBold">vc-next-action</span>, does. Now
we'll describe each of VC's other
commands in detail. We have chosen the order of these descriptions to
take you from frequently used and simpler commands to rarer and more
complex ones.</P>

<P class="docText">You can, accordingly, read to the end of chapter or bail out at any
point if you think you've learned all you need to.
But try to persevere because you may find that the descriptions of
the less common commands give you some new ideas about how to track
and organize your project files.</P>

<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.1 Working with Groups and Subtrees of Files</H4>

<P class="docText">Usually, the projects you <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2880"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2881"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2882"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2883"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2884"></A>want to put
under version control have more than one file; it's
normal for them to contain all the files under a specific directory
and subdirectory. Therefore, seeing a list of all version-controlled
files beneath the current working directory is often useful. Being
able to perform an operation on all of them <span class="docEmphasis">en
masse</span> is even more useful.</P>

<P class="docText">VC mode supports this directly. The command <span class="docEmphBold">C-x
v d</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-directory</span>)
puts you in a buffer running a customized Dired (directory editing)
mode, which lists all registered files under the current directory,
indicating which, if any, are checked out and who has locked them.
The status field in this listing is automatically kept up to date by
check-in and check-out operations.</P>

<P class="docText">If you mark several files in this Dired buffer (with the ordinary
Dired mark command described in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-5.html#gnu3-CHP-5">Chapter 5</A>) and
then perform either a <span class="docEmphBold">vc-next-action</span>
or <span class="docEmphBold">vc-revert-buffer</span>, VC performs
that operation on all the marked files. The most common case in which
you'll perform this procedure is when you want to
check in changes to several files simultaneously. VC helps you out:
it pops up a buffer for only one change comment, which it then
applies to every revision the check-in creates.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">vc-revert-buffer</span> design is a bit
more conservative; normally, it prompts you once for each file to
make sure you really want to discard its changes.</P>

<P class="docText">Some Dired commands are rebound in VC Dired to run version-control
commands. The <span class="docEmphBold">=</span> keystroke, for
example, runs <span class="docEmphBold">vc-diff</span> on the current
file rather than a Dired <span class="docEmphBold">diff</span>. And
<span class="docEmphBold">g</span> refreshes all the VC status fields
in the directory.</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.2 Difference Reports</H4>

<P class="docText">Earlier, we mentioned <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2885"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2886"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2887"></A>that version control systems help you
generate difference reports between versions. VC's
command for this is <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v =</span> (for
<span class="docEmphBold">vc-diff</span>). This command normally
shows you the difference between your work file and the last revision
you checked in so that you can see exactly what changes
you'll be committing if you check in again.</P>

<P class="docText">If you give this command a prefix argument, <span class="docEmphBold">C-u
C-x v =</span>, it prompts you for a file name and two revision
numbers and reports the difference between those revisions of the
file. If the older revision number is empty (that is, you simply
press <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span> at that prompt), it
defaults to the last checked-in revision. If the newer revision is
empty, it defaults to the work file. So pressing <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span> twice compares the work file with what
was last checked in to the repository, a very common task.</P>

<P class="docText">It's also possible to get a difference report for a
whole tree of project files. If the filename you give <span class="docEmphBold">C-u C-x v =</span> is actually a directory,
you'll see the differences between your specified
versions for every registered file underneath that directory.</P>

<P class="docText">By design, such a difference report can be shipped and mechanically
applied as a patch using Larry Wall's <span class="docEmphBold">patch</span> utility (available on all modern
Unixes). This is a tremendous help when you're
cooperating on a software project by email; you can download sources,
register them, make modifications—and then, with one command,
generate a complete patch set of your changes to mail to your
collaborators.</P>

<P class="docText">The exact format of these reports varies somewhat between version
control systems because VC uses each system's native
difference reporter.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-12-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> Generally, the
output resembles that of the Unix
<span class="docEmphBold">diff</span> command. We'll see how to customize
the report later in this chapter. Finally, the last section of the
chapter introduces Ediff, an alternate and powerful way to compare
and resolve differences between multiple files or versions.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> This is a slight
oversimplification. VC actually has its own script as a wrapper
around SCCS's <span class="docEmphBold">sccsdiff</span>, in order to give it a calling
sequence more like RCS's <span class="docEmphBold">rcsdiff</span>.</p></blockquote>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.3 Retrieving Old Revisions</H4>

<P class="docText">You can use the <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2888"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2889"></A>command <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v ~</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-version-other-window</span>) to retrieve any saved
revision of a file. The revision is retrieved into a work file with
the same name as your file, except for a suffix that identifies its
revision number (the suffix is actually a dot, followed by a tilde,
followed by the revision number, followed by another tilde). So you
can retrieve several revisions, and they won't step
on each other. This command is useful when you want to eyeball the
entire old version of a file, as opposed to just its changes from
previous versions or its differences from later ones.</P>

<P class="docText">The version suffix format is very close to what Emacs generates for
saved versions if you set the global Emacs Lisp variable <span class="docEmphBold">version-control</span> (which VC has made pretty much
obsolete). For example, if you're visiting a file
named <TT><I>foo.html</I></TT> and you retrieve version
1.3 by typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v ~ 1 . 3 Enter</span>,
you will now be visiting a file named
<TT><I>foo.html.~1.3~</I></TT> (and because it ends with a
tilde, Dired's command to flag backup files will
mark it, as discussed in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-5.html#gnu3-CHP-5">Chapter 5</A>).</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.4 Viewing Change Histories</H4>

<P class="docText">If you use <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v l</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-print-log</span>) on a <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2890"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2891"></A>registered file, VC pops up a buffer
containing that file's change history. This command
is most useful for viewing the change comments associated with each
revision.</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.5"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.5 Registering a File</H4>

<P class="docText">Normally, registering a file for <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2892"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2893"></A>version control with <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v v</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-next-action</span>) with a nonconcurrent version
control system also checks out an editable copy. Occasionally
it's useful to be able to just register a file
without checking it out. The command <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v
i</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-register</span>) does
this. With modern concurrent version control systems, this
distinction is fading away.</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.6"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.6 Inserting Version Control Headers</H4>

<P class="docText">Most version control systems <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2894"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2895"></A>encourage you to embed in your file
one or more magic strings that get automatically updated at check-in,
check-out, and revert time. The purpose of these strings is to carry
automatically inserted information about the current revision number
of the file, who last modified it, and when it was last checked in.</P>

<P class="docText">These header strings largely duplicate within the file the version
information that VC puts on the mode line—and the rest of that
information you can get with <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v l</span>
(for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-print-log</span>). This feature
might not seem very useful, but (in particular) embedding a version
string can make it possible to mine version-control information out
of a compiled binary program.</P>

<P class="docText">Further, you may frequently view version-controlled files through
something other than Emacs. If so, you won't have an
Emacs mode line displaying version control information, and there is
some value in having the magic headers visible in the file.
Accordingly, VC provides you with a command to insert them. (Note
that what VC inserts are correctly formatted placeholders for the
headers; the actual values get filled in by the underlying version
control system each time you commit the file.)</P>

<P class="docText">If you type <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v h</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-insert-headers</span>) while visiting a registered
and editable file, VC tries to determine from the syntax of the file
how to insert the version control header(s) as a comment and then do
so. VC knows about C and Java code, and <span class="docEmphBold">nroff</span>/<span class="docEmphBold">troff</span>/<span class="docEmphBold">groff</span>
code especially, and can usually deduce the right thing from
Emacs' <span class="docEmphBold">comment-start</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">comment-end</span> global variables (set by each
major mode) so it can insert HTML comments, for example. It falls
back to <span class="docEmphBold">#-to-\n</span> comments (like those
used by shell, awk, Perl, tcl, and many other Unix languages) if it
can't figure out anything better to do. This command
is also smart enough to notice if you already seem to have version
control headers present in the file and will ask you for confirmation
before inserting a redundant set.</P>

<P class="docText">One special behavior with respect to C code is worth mentioning. C
files don't actually get version headers put in
comments by default. Instead, Emacs generates a string initialization
for a static dummy variable called <span class="docEmphBold">vcid</span>. This action is taken so the header will
actually be generated into the corresponding object file as a string,
and you can use the <span class="docEmphasis">strings</span> command (if
you've got a Unix-like environment) to see which
versions of its sources a binary was generated from.</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.7"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.7 Making and Retrieving Snapshots</H4>

<P class="docText">A <span class="docEmphasis">snapshot</span> of a project is a set of
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2896"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2897"></A>revisions
of the project files treated as a unit. Typically, releases are
associated with points at which the project's
product goes to a customer or other outside evaluator.</P>

<P class="docText">When you're working with a subtree of project files
and want to define a release of a document or program, you may find
it tedious to have to do it by remembering or storing long lists of
file revision numbers. Accordingly, most version control systems give
you the ability to associate a symbolic release name with all the
revisions that make up a release, and then to use that symbolic name
later on when naming revisions for retrieval or difference reports.</P>

<P class="docText">Bare RCS and CVS both provide this capability. Bare SCCS does not,
but VC includes code to simulate it under SCCS. In practice, the
difference between native symbolic names and VC's is
next to invisible. The only drawback of VC's
simulation is that the SCCS tools won't know about
symbolic names when you call them outside VC. (Note that this concept
doesn't really apply to Subversion, because in that
environment <span class="docEmphasis">every</span> revision is a snapshot of the
files and directories comprising the entire module.)</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v s</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-create-snapshot</span>) prompts you for a symbolic
name. VC then associates this name with the current revision level of
every registered file under the current directory.</P>

<P class="docText">The symbolic names you create with <span class="docEmphBold">vc-create-snapshot</span> are also valid arguments to
any other VC command that wants a revision number. Symbolic names are
especially useful with <span class="docEmphBold">vc-diff</span>; it
means you can compare named releases with each other or with your
checked-out work files. The <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v r</span>
(for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-retrieve-snapshot</span>) command
takes a symbolic name and checks out every registered file underneath
the current working directory at the revision level associated with
the name.</P>

<P class="docText">Both the snapshot commands will fail, returning an error and not
marking or retrieving any files, if any registered file under the
current directory is checked out by anyone. The <span class="docEmphBold">vc-create-snapshot</span> command fails in order to
avoid making a snapshot that, when retrieved later,
won't restore the current state completely. It also
fails in order to avoid stepping on your work file changes before
you've had the chance to check them in or revert
them out.</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.8"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.8 Updating ChangeLog Files</H4>

<P class="docText">The command <span class="docEmphBold">C-x v a</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">vc-update-change-log</span>) helps VC work with some
project-management <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2898"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2899"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2900"></A>conventions used by the Free
Software Foundation. FSF projects generally have in each directory a
file called <span class="docEmphasis">ChangeLog</span> that is supposed to
contain timestamped modification comments for every file in that
directory. The <span class="docEmphasis">ChangeLog</span>, historically, provided
the change history, or audit trail, for which VC uses change
comments.</P>

<P class="docText">Rather than make you enter every change comment twice (!), VC
provides a hook that copies recent change comments out of masters
beneath the current directory and appends them to a
<span class="docEmphasis">ChangeLog</span> in the approved format.</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.9"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.9 Renaming Version-Controlled Files</H4>

<P class="docText">Renaming version-controlled files <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2901"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2902"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2903"></A>can be tricky. In RCS or SCCS, you
have to rename not just the work file but its associated master.
Under CVS, for reasons too arcane to go into here,
it's hard to do at all without breaking something.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">vc-rename-file</span> tries to insulate
you from the details and to catch and inform you about various error
conditions that can arise. It simply prompts for old and new
filenames, tries to do the right thing, and tells you if it cannot.</P>

<P class="docText">Renaming interacts badly with the simulated symbolic-name feature
under SCCS. This is one of the better reasons to use RCS or CVS. And,
actually, if you think you might need to rename or move files,
you're best off investigating Subversion since one
of its major design goals was to be the first version control system
in which this task is straightforward.</P>

<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-SECT-8.10"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.8.10 When VC Gets Confused</H4>

<P class="docText">The filesystem operations required to <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2904"></A>determine a file's
version control state can be expensive and slow, especially in an NFS
or other networked environment. VC goes to some pains to compensate
(unless, as we'll see later on, you tell it not to).</P>

<P class="docText">It has two major methods: (1) caching per-file information (such as
the locking user and current revision number) in memory rather than
running version control utilities to parse it out of the relevant
master every time, and (2) assuming that it can deduce a registered
file's version control state from its write
permissions. Specifically, VC assumes that a registered file that is
writable is in the checked-out-and-locked state and that a registered
file that is <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> writable is
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> a checked-out version being edited.</P>

<P class="docText">Multiuser environments being what they are, VC's
cached information and assumptions about permissions occasionally
lead it down the wrong path. This situation almost always occurs
because someone has manually changed a file's
permissions behind VC's back.</P>

<P class="docText">If you think that this situation has occurred, call <span class="docEmphBold">vc-clear-context</span>. This command forces VC to
throw away all its cached-in-memory assumptions about the version
control state of the files you are working with.</P>

<P class="docText">It is also theoretically possible for VC to get confused by a race
condition between two or more VCs, or between VC and someone running
the bare SCCS, RCS, or CVS utilities. This is not just a VC problem;
the same sort of race is possible (though less likely) between two or
more people running the bare utilities. However, this kind of race is
very rare even in VC; the authors haven't heard of
any instance in hundreds of thousands of programmer-hours in which
it's known to have happened.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're concerned about this issue, the VC source
code (<span class="docEmphasis">vc.el</span> in your Emacs Lisp source directory)
includes a comment giving a careful and extensive analysis of
potential multiuser conflict and race situations. VC is exactly as
safe from them as the underlying utilities can be.</P>
