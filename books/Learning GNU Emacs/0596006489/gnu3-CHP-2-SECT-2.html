<P class="docText">Before you start practicing deletion
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1697"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1698"></A>commands,
you might want to know the undo command, which is discussed fully
later in this chapter. Typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-_</span> or
<span class="docEmphBold">C-x u</span> undoes your last edit; typing
<span class="docEmphBold">undo</span> again undoes the edit before
that one, and so on.</P>

<P class="docText">Emacs provides many ways to delete text. The simplest way to delete
text is to press the <span class="docEmphBold">Del</span> key, which
deletes the character immediately to the left of the cursor. See
<A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-2-SECT-1.html#gnu3-CHP-2-FIG-4">Figure 2-4</A> for possible locations of the <span class="docEmphBold">Del</span> key on your keyboard. It is sometimes
referred to as the <span class="docEmphBold">Backspace</span> key.
<span class="docEmphBold">Del</span> is easiest to define by what it
does: it deletes the previous character. If you're
typing and you decide to erase the last character you typed, what key
do you reach for? That's the key Emacs refers to as
<span class="docEmphBold">Del</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">Emacs provides a number of other deletion commands—perhaps too
many for your taste, although you'll eventually find
a reason to use most of them. For example, <span class="docEmphBold">C-d</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">delete-character</span>) deletes the character under
the cursor. The command for deleting the next word is <span class="docEmphBold">M-d</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">kill-word</span>). Once again, note how the <span class="docEmphBold">Meta</span> key augments the command: <span class="docEmphBold">C-d</span> operates on a character, and <span class="docEmphBold">M-d</span> operates on a word.</P>

<P class="docText">Emacs has commands to delete
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1699"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1700"></A>the next or previous word, sentence, and
paragraph. By their names, you can guess what they do when
you're between words, sentences, or paragraphs. If
you're in the middle of an entity, however, they do
something a little surprising: they delete a portion of the current
word, sentence, or paragraph, backward or forward depending on
whether the command deletes previous or next. For example,
here's how <span class="docEmphBold">M-d</span> acts
differently depending on where the cursor is.</P>

<P class="docText">Similarly, if you are in the
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1701"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1702"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1703"></A>middle of a word and ask Emacs to
delete the previous word (<span class="docEmphBold">M-Del</span>, for
<span class="docEmphBold">backward-kill-word</span>), it deletes from
the cursor position back to the beginning of the current word.</P>

<P class="docText">If you want to delete an entire line or part of a line, use the
command <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">kill-line</span>). This command deletes everything
from the cursor to the end of the line. Typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span> on a blank line deletes the line itself.
So, it usually takes two <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span>'s to delete a line: one
to delete the text and one to delete the resulting blank line. If you
want to delete everything from the beginning of the line up to the
cursor, try the more complex incantation <span class="docEmphBold">Meta -
C-k</span> (i.e., hold down <span class="docEmphBold">Meta</span>, followed by a hyphen, and then <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span>).</P>

<P class="docText">You can also use <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span> to join two
lines. If you're at the end of a line, <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span> deletes the newline character, effectively
making two lines into one long line.</P>

<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-SECT-2.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.2.1 The Kill Ring</H4>

<P class="docText">By now you may have noticed that <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1704"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1705"></A>some deletion commands in Emacs are
called <span class="docEmphasis">kill</span> commands, such as <span class="docEmphBold">kill-region</span>, <span class="docEmphBold">kill-word</span>, and the like. In Emacs, killing is
not fatal, but in fact, quite the opposite. Text that has been killed
is not gone forever but is hidden in an area called the
<span class="docEmphasis">kill ring</span>. The kill ring, though it sounds
somewhat like a violent gang, is an internal storage area where Emacs
puts things you've copied or deleted. Do not confuse
the kill ring with the system clipboard, which allows for copying and
pasting between applications. We'll cover how Emacs
relates to the system clipboard later in this chapter.</P>

<P class="docText">You can get back what you've deleted by typing
<span class="docEmphBold">C-y</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">yank</span>).<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-2-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> Conveniently, if you kill several lines in succession,
Emacs collects them into a single item and places the whole unit into
the kill ring; a single <span class="docEmphBold">C-y</span> command
will bring everything back. In the following example,
we'll use <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span> four
times to delete the first two lines of <span class="docEmphasis">A Tale of Two
Cities</span>. (Remember: the first <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span> deletes the text; the second <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span> deletes the remaining blank line.) Then
we'll use a single <span class="docEmphBold">C-y</span> to bring everything back.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> You may be used to
pressing <span class="docEmphBold">C-v</span> to paste in all
applications if you are a Linux or Windows user. Emacs has options to
change its default paste, cut, and copy commands to the familiar C-v,
C-x, and C-c. See "Making Emacs Work the Way You
Want" for details. Also, a quick warning to
<span class="docEmphBold">vi</span> users who are learning Emacs:
<span class="docEmphBold">vi</span> also uses the term
<span class="docEmphasis">yank</span>, but its meaning is almost the exact
opposite. Don't let this confuse you.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">What exactly goes <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1706"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1707"></A>into the kill ring? Everything you
delete with <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span> in addition to
everything you delete with <span class="docEmphBold">C-w</span> and
everything you copy with <span class="docEmphBold">M-w</span> (two
commands that you'll learn shortly) go into the kill
ring. Words, sentences, and paragraphs that you delete with <span class="docEmphBold">M-d</span>, <span class="docEmphBold">M-Del</span>,
and their relatives also go into the kill ring. In addition, text
that you delete with <span class="docEmphBold">C-u</span> followed by
either <span class="docEmphBold">Del</span> or <span class="docEmphBold">C-d</span> goes into the kill ring. About the only
thing that Emacs doesn't save in the kill ring is
single characters, deleted with <span class="docEmphBold">Del</span>
or <span class="docEmphBold">C-d</span>. (If you need to, you can get
this type of deletion back using the <span class="docEmphBold">undo</span> command, bound to both <span class="docEmphBold">C- _</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">C-x
u</span>.)</P>

<P class="docText">Emacs is clever about what it puts into the kill ring: when it is
assembling a big block of text from a group of deletions, it always
assembles the text correctly. For example, you can type a few
<span class="docEmphBold">M-d</span>'s, followed by
some <span class="docEmphBold">M-Del</span>'s, with
a couple of <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span>'s
thrown in. When you type <span class="docEmphBold">C-y</span>, Emacs
yanks all the text that you've deleted in the proper
order.</P>

<P class="docText">However, there's one thing you have to watch out
for. Emacs stops assembling these blocks of text as soon as you give
any command that <span class="docEmphasis">isn't</span> a kill
command. For example, if you type <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span>, then delete a single character with
<span class="docEmphBold">C-d</span>, then type another <span class="docEmphBold">C-k</span>, you've broken the chain.
Emacs doesn't consider deletion of a single
character with <span class="docEmphBold">C-d</span> a
"kill" command;
it's just a deletion and it isn't
stored. In this case, you haven't made a single
chain of kill commands; you've made two chains.
Later, we'll see how to get the older killed text
back.</P>
