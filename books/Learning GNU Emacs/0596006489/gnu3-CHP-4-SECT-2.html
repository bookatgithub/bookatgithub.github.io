<P class="docText">If you want to create a
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-1998"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-1999"></A>buffer that contains a file, simply type
<span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-f</span> to find the file. Emacs
automatically creates a second buffer and moves you there. If you
already have a copy of the file in a buffer, <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-f</span> just moves you to the existing buffer.
This move is sensible and probably really what you want anyhow; if
<span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-f</span> read the file from disk
every time, you could end up with many versions of the same file that
were each slightly different. If the filename you give <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-f</span> doesn't exist, Emacs
assumes you want to create a new file by that name and moves you to a
blank buffer.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-f</span> is always followed by a
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2000"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2001"></A>filename. The command for moving between
buffers, <span class="docEmphBold">C-x b</span>, is followed by a
buffer name. Did you realize that the mode line
doesn't display filenames but only buffer names?
Some versions of Emacs show both, but GNU Emacs shows only the buffer
name. The buffer name and the filename, if any, are the same unless
you change them (see the section "Renaming
Buffers," later in this chapter).</P>

<P class="docText">To move between the buffers, type <span class="docEmphBold">C-x
b</span>. Emacs shows you a default buffer name. Press <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span> if that's the buffer
you want, or type the first few characters of the correct buffer name
and press <span class="docEmphBold">Tab</span>. Emacs fills in the
rest of the name. Now press <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span> to
move to the buffer.</P>

your tried-and-true <TT>dickens</TT> buffer. But

<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.2.2 Deleting Buffers</H4>

<P class="docText">It's easy to create buffers, and just
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2007"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2008"></A>as
easy to delete them when you want to. You may want to delete buffers
if you feel your Emacs session is getting cluttered with too many
buffers. Perhaps you started out working on a set of five buffers and
now want to do something with another five. Getting rid of the first
set of buffers makes it a bit easier to keep things straight.
Deleting a buffer can also be a useful emergency escape. For example,
some replacement operation may have had disastrous results. You can
kill the buffer and choose not to save the changes, then read the
file again.</P>

<P class="docText">Deleting a buffer doesn't delete the underlying file
nor is it the same as not displaying a buffer. Buffers that are not
displayed are still active whereas deleted buffers are no longer part
of your Emacs session. Using the analogy of a stack of pages,
deleting a buffer is like taking a page out of the current stack of
buffers you are editing and filing it away.</P>

<P class="docText">Deleting buffers doesn't put you at risk of losing
changes, either. If you've changed the buffer (and
the buffer is associated with a file), Emacs asks if you want to save
your changes before the buffer is deleted. You will lose changes to
any buffers that aren't connected to files, but you
probably don't care about these buffers.</P>

<P class="docText">Deleting a buffer is such a basic operation that it is on the Emacs
toolbar, the X symbol. Now let's learn how to do it
from the keyboard to increase your fluency in Emacs.</P>

<P class="docText">To delete a buffer, type <span class="docEmphBold">C-x k</span> (for
<span class="docEmphBold">kill-buffer</span>). Emacs shows the name
of the buffer currently displayed; press <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span> to delete it or type another buffer name
if the one being displayed is not the one you want to delete, then
press <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span>. If
you've made changes that you
haven't yet saved, Emacs displays the following
message:</P>

<PRE>Buffer <TT><I>buffer name </I></TT> modified. Kill anyway? (yes or no).</PRE><BR>


<P class="docText">To ditch your changes, type <span class="docEmphBold">yes</span>, and
Emacs kills the buffer. To stop the buffer deletion process, type
<span class="docEmphBold">no</span>. You can then type <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-s</span> to save the buffer, followed by
<span class="docEmphBold">C-x k</span> to kill it.</P>

<P class="docText">You can also have Emacs ask you about deleting each buffer, and you
can decide whether to kill each one individually. Type <span class="docEmphBold">M-x kill-some-buffers</span> to weed out unneeded
buffers this way. Emacs displays the name of each buffer and whether
or not it was modified, then asks whether you want to kill it. Emacs
offers to kill each and every buffer, including the buffers it
creates automatically, like <TT>*scratch*</TT> and
<TT>*Messages*</TT>. If you kill all the buffers in your
session, Emacs creates a new <TT>*scratch*</TT> buffer;
after all, something has to display on the screen!</P>
