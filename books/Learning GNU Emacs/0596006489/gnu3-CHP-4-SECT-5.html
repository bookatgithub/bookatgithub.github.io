<P class="docText">In this section, we'll learn about saving multiple
buffers, renaming buffers, read-only buffers, and operations you can
do with the buffer list—not only a useful tool but a good
introduction to the principles you'll encounter in
the directory editor, Dired, covered in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-5.html#gnu3-CHP-5">Chapter 5</A>.</P>

<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-SECT-5.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.5.1 Saving Multiple Buffers</H4>

<P class="docText">You know about saving buffers
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2041"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2042"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2043"></A>individually
by typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-s</span>. Once
you're using multiple buffers, you should also know
that you can save them all at once by typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-x s</span> (for <span class="docEmphBold">save-some-buffers</span>). Emacs asks you if you want
to save each buffer that is connected with a file (it
doesn't offer to save new buffers
you've created but have not associated with a file
and, of course, it doesn't save its own internal
buffers). For each buffer, you can answer <span class="docEmphBold">y</span> to save it or <span class="docEmphBold">n</span> not to. You can also type <span class="docEmphBold">!</span> to save all the buffers without asking. If
you want to save this buffer and no more, type a period (.). If you want to cancel the command and not
save the current buffer, press <span class="docEmphBold">q</span> (of
course, any buffers you saved before pressing <span class="docEmphBold">q</span> are already saved; <span class="docEmphBold">q</span> does not undo those). You may want to look
at the buffer before deciding whether to save it; if so, type
<span class="docEmphBold">C-r</span>. Emacs enters view mode,
allowing you to look at the buffer but not make changes. Press
<span class="docEmphBold">q</span> to exit view mode and continue
saving buffers.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.5.2 Renaming Buffers</H4>

<P class="docText">When you are editing a file,
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2044"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2045"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2046"></A>the buffer takes on the name of the
file. If you have long filenames, you may find it convenient to
rename buffers to shorter names (this renaming
doesn't affect the filename, just the buffer name).
This feature is mostly useful on versions of Emacs that
don't offer good completion capabilities; in GNU
Emacs, whenever you have to type a buffer name, you just type the
first few unique letters and press <span class="docEmphBold">Tab</span> to have Emacs complete the name for you.
In some circumstances, you may want to rename buffers.</P>

<P class="docText">To rename a buffer, type <span class="docEmphBold">M-x
rename-buffer</span>. Emacs asks for the new name; type it and
press <span class="docEmphBold">Enter</span>. The new name is
displayed on the mode line. Renaming buffers comes in particularly
handy in shell mode, described in <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-5.html#gnu3-CHP-5">Chapter 5</A>.
You start one command shell, and then rename the buffer and start
another, in this way running as many shells as you have use for
simultaneously.</P>

<P class="docText">As mentioned earlier, in GNU Emacs only the buffer name is displayed
on the mode line, rather than the buffer name
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2047"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2048"></A>and the filename. Even if you rename a
buffer that contains a file, Emacs remembers the connection between
buffer and file, which you can see if you save the file (<span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-s</span>) or display the buffer list (described
later in the chapter).</P>

<P class="docText">What if you have two buffers
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2049"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2050"></A>with the same name? Let's
say you are editing a file called <span class="docEmphasis">outline</span> from
your home directory and another file called
<span class="docEmphasis">outline</span> from one of your subdirectories. Both
buffers are called <TT>outline</TT>, but Emacs
differentiates them by appending <TT>&lt;2&gt;</TT> to the
name of the second buffer. (You can tell which is which by looking at
the buffer list, discussed later in this chapter.) Emacs offers an
option that adds a directory to buffers in this situation: select Use
Directory in Buffer Names from the Options menu.
Let's say you've turned on this
option and are editing a file called <span class="docEmphasis">.localized</span>;
Emacs will call this buffer simply <TT>.localized</TT>. Now
you find a second file of the same name from a subdirectory. Instead
of calling this buffer <TT>.localized&lt;2&gt;</TT>, Emacs
names the buffer
<span class="docEmphasis">directory</span><TT>/.localized</TT>, making
it easy for you to tell the buffers apart at a glance. This option
has some limitations. It shows only the parent directory, not the
full path, and it shows directory names only if multiple buffers have
the same name. We wish it would go a bit further and provide the
option of including the directory on the mode line for all buffers.</P>

<P class="docText">One word of advice: if you have a lot of buffers with names like
<TT>proposal</TT>, <TT>proposal</TT>
<TT>&lt;2&gt;</TT>, and
<TT>proposal&lt;3&gt;</TT> around, you're
probably forgetting to edit the directory when you ask for a file. If
you try to find a file but get the directory wrong, Emacs assumes you
want to start a new file. For example, let's say you
want to edit the file <span class="docEmphasis">~/work/proposal</span>, but
instead ask for the file <span class="docEmphasis">~/novel/proposal</span>. Since
<span class="docEmphasis">~/novel/proposal</span> doesn't exist,
Emacs creates a new, empty buffer named <TT>proposal</TT>.
If you correct your mistake (<span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-f
~/work/proposal</span>), Emacs renames your buffers accordingly:
your empty buffer <TT>proposal</TT> is associated with
<span class="docEmphasis">~/novel/proposal</span>; the buffer you want is named
<TT>proposal&lt;2&gt;</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">Here's a hint for dealing with the very common
mistake of finding the wrong file. If you notice that
you've found the wrong file with <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-f</span>, use <span class="docEmphBold">C-x
C-v</span> to replace it with the one you want. <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-v</span> finds a file, but instead of making a
new buffer, it replaces the file in the current buffer. It means
"get me the file I really meant to find instead of
this one." Using this command circumvents the
problem of having unnecessary numbered buffers (i.e.,
<TT>proposal</TT>, <TT>proposal&lt;2&gt;</TT>,
and so on) lying around.</P>


<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-SECT-5.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">4.5.3 Read-Only Buffers</H4>

<P class="docText">While you're working,
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2051"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2052"></A>you may need to read some file that you
don't want to change: you just want to browse
through it and look at its contents. Of course, it is easy to touch
the keyboard accidentally and make spurious modifications.
We've discussed several ways to restore the original
file, but it would be better to prevent this from happening at all.
How?</P>

<P class="docText">You can make any buffer read-only by pressing <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-q</span>. Try this on a practice buffer and
you'll notice that <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2053"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2054"></A>two percent signs
(<TT>%%</TT>) appear on the left side of the mode line, in
the same place where <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2055"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2056"></A>asterisks (<TT>**</TT>)
appear if you've changed a buffer. The percent signs
indicate that the buffer is read-only.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#gnu3-CHP-4-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> If
you try to type in a read-only buffer, Emacs just beeps at you and
displays an error message (<TT>Buffer is read-only</TT>) in
the minibuffer. What happens when you change your mind and want to
start editing the read-only buffer again? Just type <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-q</span> again. This command toggles the
buffer's read-only status—that is, typing
<span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-q</span> repeatedly makes the buffer
alternate between read-only and read-write.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> The exception
to the rule that <TT>**</TT> means changed and
<TT>%%</TT> means read-only is the
<TT>*scratch*</TT> buffer. Because Emacs
doesn't warn you if you kill the
<TT>*scratch*</TT> buffer, even if it is changed, it wants
to give you some indication that there are unsaved changes. Instead
of <TT>%%</TT>, the <TT>*scratch*</TT> buffer
puts <TT>%*</TT> on the mode line.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Of course, toggling read-only <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2057"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2058"></A>status doesn't change
the permissions on a file. If you are editing a buffer containing
someone else's file, <span class="docEmphBold">C-x
C-q</span> does not change the read-only status. One way to edit
someone else's file is to make a copy of your own
using the <span class="docEmphBold">write-file</span> command, and
then make changes. Let's say you want to change a
proposal that is owned by someone else. Read the file, write the file
as one you own using <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-w</span>, then
change it from read-only to writable status by pressing <span class="docEmphBold">C-x C-q</span>. None of this, of course, modifies the
original file; it just gives you a copy to work with. If you want to
move a minor amount of text from a read-only file to another, you can
mark the text then press <span class="docEmphBold">M-w</span> to copy
it. Move to the place you want to put the text and press <span class="docEmphBold">C-y</span> to paste it.</P>

<P class="docText">You can open a file as read-only in a new window by typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-x 4 r</span> or in a new frame by typing <span class="docEmphBold">C-x 5 r</span>. This is one of a number of commands
in which <span class="docEmphasis">4</span> means window and
<span class="docEmphasis">5</span> means frame.</P>

or <span class="docEmphBold">C-n</span> to move down a
line or <span class="docEmphBold">p</span> or <span class="docEmphBold">C-p</span> to move up a line. You can also press
<span class="docEmphBold">Space</span> to move down to the next line
and <span class="docEmphBold">Del</span> to move up. (The up and down
arrow keys work, too.) This array of up and down choices may seem
confusing, but multiple bindings are given to make it easy to move up
and down without consulting a book like this one.</P>

<P class="docText">You use a set of one-character commands to work with the buffers that
are listed. To delete a buffer, go to the line for the buffer you
want to delete and type <span class="docEmphBold">d</span> or
<span class="docEmphBold">k</span>. The letter <TT>D</TT>
appears in the first column. You can mark as many buffers for
deletion as you want to. The buffers aren't deleted
immediately; when you're finished marking buffers,
press <span class="docEmphBold">x</span> (which stands for
"execute") to delete them. If any
of the buffers you want to delete are connected with files, Emacs
asks if you want to save the changes before doing anything. (Note
that it does not ask you about buffers that aren't
connected with files, so be sure to save any that you want before
deleting them.)</P>

<P class="docText">If you change your mind about deleting a buffer before typing
<span class="docEmphBold">x</span>, you can unmark the buffer by
going to the appropriate line and typing <span class="docEmphBold">u</span>. As a convenience, the <span class="docEmphBold">Del</span> key also unmarks the previous buffer in
the list. Why would you do this? Simple: <span class="docEmphBold">d</span> automatically moves you down one line. If
you mark a file for deletion and immediately change your mind, you
can press a single <span class="docEmphBold">Del</span> rather than
moving to the previous line and typing <span class="docEmphBold">u</span> for <span class="docEmphasis">unmark</span>).</P>

<P class="docText">To save a buffer, go to the line for <A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2068"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2069"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2070"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2071"></A>the buffer you want to save and press
<span class="docEmphBold">s</span>. The letter <TT>S</TT>

when you really want to save the buffer. Therefore, you can look at
the buffer list, choose which buffers you want to delete and which
you want to save, and then type <span class="docEmphBold">x</span> to
do everything at once. Again, you can press <span class="docEmphBold">u</span> or <span class="docEmphBold">Del</span> to

(<span class="docEmphBold">~</span>). Typing <span class="docEmphBold">~</span> marks a buffer as unmodified. In effect,
this symbol tells Emacs not to save changes automatically (since the
buffer is unmodified, Emacs has no reason to save changes with its
auto-save feature). Of course, if you have made changes, the changes
are still in the buffer; it's just that
you're in essence
"lying" to Emacs to say that no
changes have been made. Also, if you change the buffer again after
marking it unmodified, Emacs once again knows it has been modified
and saves it automatically in a backup file. The backup filename (not
coincidentally) has the format <span class="docEmphasis">filename~</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">You can change a buffer's status from
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2075"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2076"></A>read-write to read-only and back again
by pressing <span class="docEmphBold">%</span>. Pressing <span class="docEmphBold">%</span> changes the buffer's status
immediately. Percentage signs appear on the mode line when a buffer
is read-only. When you are editing, you can toggle a buffer between
read-write and read-only by pressing <span class="docEmphBold">C-x
C-q</span>, as we discussed earlier.</P>

<P class="docText">You can also use the buffer list to display multiple buffers in
windows. To display one of the buffers in a full screen, move the
cursor into the buffer list's window; use <span class="docEmphBold">C-n</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">C-p</span>
to move to the line for the buffer that you want, and press <span class="docEmphBold">1</span> (the number one). Emacs displays the buffer

the other window and puts the cursor there. Pressing <span class="docEmphBold">C-o</span> has a slightly different result; Emacs
displays the buffer in another window but doesn't
put the cursor there.</P>

<P class="docText">One final buffer display command remains. You can ask Emacs to
display multiple buffers and have Emacs
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2077"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2078"></A>create
