<H2 class="docChapterTitle">Chapter 5. Emacs as a Work Environment</H2>


<P class="docText">Many of the everyday things you do from a command prompt can be done
from within Emacs. You can execute commands, work with directories,
and print files—all without leaving Emacs. Changing tasks is as
simple as jumping between buffers.</P>

<P class="docText">What's important about this? Of course,
it's nice to be able to move between tasks easily.
What's even more important is that you have the same
editing environment no matter what you're doing: you
can use all of the Emacs editing commands to work on a file, give
shell commands, then start up Dired, the directory editor, to do some
file maintenance. It is simple to move text from one window to
another. You can execute a command and then use Emacs commands to cut
and paste the results into a file. If you're trying
to compile a program and keep getting error messages, you can save
the interactive session as a file and confer with someone about the
problem. Despite the many advantages of modern window systems, Emacs
often provides the best way to integrate the many kinds of work you
do daily.</P>

<P class="docText">Much of the information in this chapter involves integration between
Emacs and the operating system. Emacs is most commonly a Unix editor,
so forgive us for a bias in that direction. But we are happy to
report that for users of GNU Emacs on other platforms, integration
with the operating system is still available; you can use shell mode
to run commands and can edit directories with Dired.
There's no reason to leave Emacs no matter what your
platform is.</P>
