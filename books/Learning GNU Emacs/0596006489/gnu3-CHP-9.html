<P class="docText">As many programmers know, the task of programming usually breaks down
into a cycle of think-write-debug. If you have used Unix (or various
other operating systems) for programming, you have probably become
accustomed to using separate tools for each phase of the cycle, for
example, a text editor for writing, a compiler for compiling, and the
operating system itself for running programs. You would undoubtedly
find an environment much more productive if the boundaries between
the cycle phases—and the tools that support them—were
erased.</P>

<P class="docText">Emacs provides considerable support for writing, running, and
debugging programs written in a wide variety of languages, and it
integrates this support into a smooth framework. You never have to
leave Emacs when developing programs, so you will find it easier to
concentrate on the actual programming task (i.e., the
"think" part of the cycle) because
you won't have to spend lots of time going from one
tool to another.</P>

<P class="docText">When you write code, you can
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-9-ITERM-2513"></A><A NAME="gnu3-CHP-9-ITERM-2514"></A>use one of Emacs's
<span class="docEmphasis">programming language modes</span>; these turn Emacs
into a spiffy syntax-directed or language-sensitive editor that knows
about the syntax of the language. That makes it easier for you to
write code in a uniform, easy-to-read, customizable style. Language
modes exist for several different programming languages.</P>

<P class="docText">Emacs also supports running and debugging programs. Shell mode (see
<A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-5.html#gnu3-CHP-5">Chapter 5</A>) and multiple windows (see <A class="docLink" HREF="gnu3-CHP-4.html#gnu3-CHP-4">Chapter 4</A>) allow you to run your code while editing
it. Emacs has a powerful facility for interfacing to many compilers
and the Unix <span class="docEmphBold">make</span> command: Emacs can
interpret compilers' error messages and visit files
where errors occur at the appropriate line number. Indeed, many tools
(such as the Java build tool, <span class="docEmphBold">ant</span>)
include command-line options to format their output in an
Emacs-friendly way.</P>

<P class="docText">In this chapter, we cover the features of language modes in general
such as compiling and debugging programs, comments, indentation, and
syntax highlighting. We also spend a bit of time upfront looking at
<A NAME="gnu3-CHP-9-ITERM-2515"></A>the <span class="docEmphBold">etags</span> facility, which is a great help to
programmers who work on large, multifile projects. These features
apply to all language modes. We then delve into
Emacs's support for various languages, including C,
C++, Java, Perl, SQL, and Lisp.</P>
