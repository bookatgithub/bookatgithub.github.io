<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Debra Cameron</span>: First, I would like
to thank Duffy Craven for introducing me to Emacs. Second, I would
like to thank my coauthors. Bill Rosenblatt was a tremendous help on
the first edition of this book, and Eric Raymond worked with blinding
speed and brilliance on the second, providing some input on the third
as well. I would especially like to thank my coauthors Jim Elliott
and Marc Loy, without whom, in all honesty, this third edition would
never have been finished. Their constant encouragement, support, and
hard work helped make this edition a reality. I would like to thank
all the readers who wrote in with their suggestions, especially
Russell Harris, Seema Kumar, and Hui Oulan. I would also like to
thank Eric Pement, who pointed me to the very interesting TEI Emacs
add-on, as well as the authors of that extended environment for
Emacs, including Sebastian Rahtz and Syd Bauman. Personally, I would
like to thank my husband Jim and my kids Meg, David, Beth, and Kevin
for their patience and help during the revision of this book and also
my friends Irene and Jacki for their support. Most of all, I would
like to thank all the developers and hackers who continue to make GNU
Emacs the most amazing piece of software I have ever worked with.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">James Elliott</span>: I have to thank Deb
for asking me to help people learn about Emacs. I've
long admired (and relied on) the editor and its ever-growing
ecosystem of tools and extensions, as well as the philosophy and
results of the Free Software Foundation. They represent a
distillation of what makes computing an interesting and valuable
field for me, and I am honored to be part of this project.
Ironically, I have to also thank Deb for letting me take a big chunk
of time off when my Hibernate book came into being.</P>

<P class="docText">Thanks are also due to Marc, both for initially introducing me to the
fine folks at O'Reilly and for his help and input on
this book. He ended up contributing more than he signed up for when I
got pulled away in the middle. Nor should I forget my fine colleagues
at GE's Corporate Research and Development Center in
Niskayuna, New York who first introduced me to the mysteries of Emacs
as an intern there. I'm indebted to Joe for his love
and support. And let's hear it for the cast of
thousands who have grown Emacs into what it is today!</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Marc Loy</span>: I have the occasionally
lazy—no, let's say overworked—staff at
the University of Southern California's computer labs to thank for
getting me started on Emacs. They were out of <span class="docEmphBold">vi</span> cheat sheets when I sat down to write my
first computer program. (I won't admit to the
language I had to use.) I've been grateful for that
happenstance ever since. I'd also like to thank Jim
and Deb for their cheery outlook on things as we finished up this
latest edition. As always, my sister Amy and my partner Ron remain
constant forces for good in my world and make all the silliness (like
politics) surrounding the fun stuff (like writing about Emacs)
tolerable.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Eric Raymond</span>: My thanks go first to
the hacker community at large, all the people who created the rich
tradition of Emacs Lisp programming that takes Emacs customization
from elegant theoretical possibility to practical tool. I learned
what I know partly from reading code written by the likes of Olin
Shivers, Jamie Zawinski, Kyle Jones, Barry Warsaw, Roland McGrath,
Richard Stallman himself (of course), and many others. Secondly, my
thanks and warmest love go as always to my wife Catherine, who
supported me on many levels while I worked on my bits of this book.
Finally, my thanks and respect to the hip, professional, and clueful
people at O'Reilly. They know how to produce a good
book and how to treat an author right. They care, and it shows.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Bill Rosenblatt</span>: I would like to
thank the following people: Professor Richard Martin (Princeton
Classics Department), for planting the seed in me that eventually
turned writing from a chore to a pleasure; Intermetrics, Inc., for
giving me little enough to do that I could fritter away my workdays
delving into GNU Emacs; Hal Stern, for getting me this gig; Sandy
Wise, for his help; Jessica Lustig, for her love and support; and
most importantly, my grad-school housemates for putting up with a
tied-up phone line at all hours of the day and night.</P>
