<FONT><h2>Chapter
10. Frameworks and Applications</h2>

<p>All the examples in this book so far have been quite small, and they
may seem toys compared to real-world applications. This chapter shows
some of the frameworks that are available to Python programmers who
wish to build such applications in some specific domains. A
<a NAME="idx811"></a>framework
can be thought of as a domain-specific set of classes and expected
patterns of interactions between these classes. We mention just three
here: the<a naME="idx812"></A> COM
framework for interacting with <A name="idx813"></A>Microsoft's Common
Object Model, the
<A NAme="idx814"></a>
<a name="idx815"></a>Tkinter graphical user
interface (GUI), and the<a name="idx816"></a> Swing Java GUI toolkit. Along the way
we also use a few of the web-related modules in the standard library.</p>



<p>We illustrate the power of frameworks using a hypothetical,
real-world scenario, that of a small company's web site, and
the need to collect, maintain, and respond to customer input about
the product through a web form. We describe three programs in this
scenario. The first program is a web-based data entry form that asks
the user to enter some information in their web browser, and then
saves that information on disk. The second program uses the same data
and automatically uses Microsoft Word to print out a customized form
letter based on that information. The final example is a simple
browser for the saved data built with the Tkinter module, which uses
the Tk GUI, a powerful, portable toolkit for managing windows,
buttons, menus, etc. Hopefully, these examples will make you realize
how these kinds of toolkits, when combined with the rapid development
power of Python, can truly let you build "real"
applications fast. Each program builds on the previous one, so we
strongly recommend that you read through each program, even if you
can't (or don't wish to) get them up and running on your
computer.</p>



<p>The last section of this chapter covers JPython, the Java port of
Python. The chapter closes with a medium-sized JPython program that
allows users to manipulate mathematical functions graphically using
the Swing toolkit.</p>
