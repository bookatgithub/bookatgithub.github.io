<h4>9.5.1
Compounding Your Interest</h4>


<P>Someday, most of us hope to put a little money away in a savings
account (assuming those student loans ever go away). Banks hope you
do too, so much so that they'll pay you for the privilege of
holding onto your money. In a typical savings account, your bank pays
you i<A NAme="idx798"></a> <a NAME="idx799"></a>nterest on your principal. Moreover,
they keep adding the percentage they pay you back to your total, so
that your balance grows a little bit each year. The upshot is that
you need to project on a year-by-year basis if you want to track the
growth in your savings. This program,<i>
interest.py</i>
<a NAME="idx800"></a>, is an easy way to do it in Python:</p>



<pre class="monofont">trace = 1  # print each year?

def calc(principal, interest, years):
    for y in range(years):
        principal = principal * (1.00 + (interest / 100.0))
        if trace: print y+1, '=&gt; %.2f' % principal
    return principal</pre>


<p>This function just loops through the number of years you pass in,
accumulating the principal (your initial deposit plus all the
interest added so far) for each year. It assumes that you'll
avoid the temptation to withdraw money. Now, suppose we have $65,000
to invest in a 5.5% interest yield account, and want to track how the
principal will grow over 10 years. We import and call our compounding
function passing in a starting principal, an interest rate, and the
number of years we want to project:</p>



<pre clAsS="monofont">% <b>python</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>from interest import calc</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>calc(65000, 5.5, 10)</B>
1 =&gt; 68575.00
2 =&gt; 72346.63
3 =&gt; 76325.69
4 =&gt; 80523.60
5 =&gt; 84952.40
6 =&gt; 89624.78
7 =&gt; 94554.15
8 =&gt; 99754.62
9 =&gt; 105241.13
10 =&gt; 111029.39
111029.389793</PrE>


<P>and we wind up with $111,029. If we just want to see the final
balance, we can set the <tT cLASS="monofont">trace</tt> global
(module-level) variable in <tt CLASs="monofont">interest</tt> to
before we call the <tT CLAss="monofont">calc</tt> function:</P>



<PRE class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import interest</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>interest.trace = 0</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>calc(65000, 5.5, 10)</b>
111029.389793</pre>


<p>Naturally, there are many ways to calculate compound interest. For
example, the variation of the interest calculator function below adds
to the principal explicitly, and prints both the interest earned
(<tt claSs="monofont">earnings</Tt>) and current balance
(<tt ClASs="monofont">principal</TT>) as it steps through the years:</p>



<PrE CLAss="monofont">def calc(principal, interest, years):
    interest = interest / 100.0
    for y in range(years):
        earnings  = principal * interest
        principal = principal + earnings
        if trace: print y+1, '(+%d)' % earnings, '=&gt; %.2f' % principal
    return principal</prE>


<P> We get the same results with this version, but more information:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>interest.trace = 1</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>calc(65000, 5.5, 10)</b>
1 (+3575) =&gt; 68575.00
2 (+3771) =&gt; 72346.63
3 (+3979) =&gt; 76325.69
4 (+4197) =&gt; 80523.60
5 (+4428) =&gt; 84952.40
6 (+4672) =&gt; 89624.78
7 (+4929) =&gt; 94554.15
8 (+5200) =&gt; 99754.62
9 (+5486) =&gt; 105241.13
10 (+5788) =&gt; 111029.39
111029.389793</pRE>


<P>The last comment on this script is that it may not give you exactly
the same numbers as your bank. Bank programs tend to round everything
off to the cent on a regular basis. Our program rounds off the
numbers to the cent when printing the results (that's what the
<Tt class="monofont">%.2f</tt> does; see <a href="lpython_cnode17.html">Chapter 2</a> for
details), but keeps the full precision afforded by the computer in
its intermediate<a name="idx801"></a> computation (as shown in the
last<A nAme="idx802"></a>
<A nAMe="idx803"></A> line).</P>







<h4>9.5.2
An Automated Dial-Out Script</H4>


<p>One upon a time, a <A NAMe="idx804"></a>
<a nAME="idx805"></A>certain book's coauthor worked
at a company without an Internet feed. The system support staff did,
however, install a dial-out modem on site, so anyone with a personal
Internet account and a little Unix savvy could connect to a shell
account and do all their Internet business at work. Dialing out meant
using the Kermit file transfer utility.</p>



<p>One drawback with the modem setup was that people wanting to dial out
had to keep trying each of 10 possible modems until one was free
(dial on one; if it's busy, try another, and so on). Since
modems were addressable under Unix using the filename
pattern <i>/dev/modem*</i>, and modem locks
via <I>/var/spool/locks/LCK*modem*</I>, a simple Python
script was enough to check for free modems automatically. The
following program, <I>dokermit,</I> uses a list of
integers to keep track of which modems are locked,
<tt clASS="monofont">glob.glob</Tt> to do filename expansion, and
<tt class="monofont">os.system</tt> to run a kermit command when a free
modem has been found:</p>



<pre class="monofont">#!/usr/bin/env python
# find a free modem to dial out on

import glob, os, string
LOCKS = "/var/spool/locks/"

locked = [0] * 10
for lockname in glob.glob(LOCKS + "LCK*modem*"):    # find locked modems
    print "Found lock:", lockname
    locked[string.atoi(lockname[-1])] = 1           # 0..9 at end of name

print 'free: ',
for i in range(10):                                 # report, dial-out
    if not locked[i]: print i,
print

for i in range(10):
    if not locked[i]:
        if raw_input("Try %d? " % i) == 'y':
            os.system("kermit -m hayes -l /dev/modem%d -b 19200 -S" % i)
            if raw_input("More? ") != 'y': break</pRe>


<P>By convention, modem lock files have the modem number at the end of
their names; we use this hook to build a modem device name in the
Kermit command. Notice that this script keeps a list of 10 integer
flags to mark which modems are free (1 means locked). The program
above works only if there are 10 or fewer modems; if there are more,
you'd need to use larger lists and loops, and parse the lock
filename, not just look at its last character.</p>







<h4>9.5.3
An Interactive Rolodex</h4>


<P>While<a NAmE="idx806"></A>
most of the preceding examples use lists as the primary data
structures, dictionaries are in many ways more powerful and fun to
use. Their presence as a built-in data type is part of what makes
Python high level, which basically means "easy to use for
complex tasks." Complementing this rich set of built-in data
types is an extensive standard library. One powerful module in this
library is the <tT cLASS="monofont">cmd</tt>
<a nAME="idx807"></A> module
that provides a class <tt clASS="monofont">Cmd</Tt> you can subclass to
make simple command-line interpreter. The following example is fairly
large, but it's really not that complicated, and illustrates
well the power of dictionaries and of reuse of standard modules.</p>



<p>The task at hand is to keep track of names and phone numbers and
allow the user to manipulate this list using an interactive
interface, with error checking and user-friendly features such as
online help. The following example shows the kind of interaction our
program allows:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">% <b>python rolo.py</b>
Monty's Friends: <b>help</b>                       

Documented commands (type help &lt;topic&gt;):
========================================
EOF             add             find            list            load
save

Undocumented commands:
======================
help</pre>


<p>We can get help on specific commands:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">Monty's Friends: <b>help find</B>              # compare with the help_find() method
Find an entry (specify a name)</pre>


<P>We can manipulate the entries of the Rolodex easily enough:</p>



<PRe CLaSs="monofont">Monty's Friends: <B>add larry</B>                  # we can add entries
Enter Phone Number for larry: <B>555-1216</B>
Monty's Friends: <b>add</b>                        # if the name is not specified...
Enter Name: <b>tom</b>                             # ...the program will ask for it
Enter Phone Number for tom: <B>555-1000</B>
Monty's Friends: <B>list</B>
=========================================
               larry : 555-1216
                 tom : 555-1000
=========================================
Monty's Friends: <b>find larry</b>
The number for larry is 555-1216.
Monty's Friends: <b>save myNames</b>             # save our work
Monty's Friends: <B>^D</B>                       # quit the program  (^Z on Windows)</PRe>


<p>And the nice thing is, when we restart this program, we can recover
the saved data:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">% <b>python rolo.py               </b>        # restart
Monty's Friends: <b>list</b>                  # by default, there is no one listed
Monty's Friends: <b>load myNames</b>          # it only takes this to reload the dir
Monty's Friends: <b>list</b>
=========================================
               larry : 555-1216
                 tom : 555-1000
=========================================</pre>


<p>Most of the interactive interpreter functionality is provided by the
<tt claSs="monofont">Cmd</Tt>
<a nAmE="idx808"></A> class in the
<tT ClAsS="monofont">cmd</TT> module, which just needs customization to
work. Specifically, you need to set the <Tt claSS="monofont">prompt</TT>
attribute and add some methods that start with <tt clASS="monofont">do_</Tt>
and <tt cLASS="monofont">help_</tt>. The <tt class="monofont">do_</tt> methods must
take a single argument, and the part after the <tt class="monofont">do_</tt>
is the name of the command. Once you call the
<Tt ClasS="monofont">cmdloop()</tT> method, the <Tt CLaSs="monofont">Cmd</TT> class
does the rest. Read the following code,<I> rolo.py</I>,
one method at a time and compare the methods with the previous
output:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">#!/usr/bin/env python 
# An interactive rolodex

import string, sys, pickle, cmd

class Rolodex(cmd.Cmd):

    def __init__(self):
        cmd.Cmd.__init__(self)              # initialize the base class
        self.prompt = "Monty's Friends: "   # customize the prompt
        self.people = {}                    # at first, we know nobody

    def help_add(self): 
        print "Adds an entry (specify a name)"
    def do_add(self, name):
        if name == "": name = raw_input("Enter Name: ")
        phone = raw_input("Enter Phone Number for "+ name+": ")
        self.people[name] = phone           # add phone number for name

    def help_find(self):
        print "Find an entry (specify a name)"
    def do_find(self, name):
        if name == "": name = raw_input("Enter Name: ")
        if self.people.has_key(name):
            print "The number for %s is %s." % (name, self.people[name])
        else:
            print "We have no record for %s." % (name,)

    def help_list(self):
        print "Prints the contents of the directory"
    def do_list(self, line):        
        names = self.people.keys()         # the keys are the names
        if names == []: return             # if there are no names, exit
        names.sort()                       # we want them in alphabetic order
        print '='*41
        for name in names:
           print string.rjust(name, 20), ":", string.ljust(self.people[name], 20)
        print '='*41

    def help_EOF(self):
        print "Quits the program"
    def do_EOF(self, line):
        sys.exit()

    def help_save(self):
        print "save the current state of affairs"
    def do_save(self, filename):
        if filename == "": filename = raw_input("Enter filename: ")
        saveFile = open(filename, 'w')
        pickle.dump(self.people, saveFile)

    def help_load(self):
        print "load a directory"
    def do_load(self, filename):
        if filename == "": filename = raw_input("Enter filename: ")
        saveFile = open(filename, 'r')
        self.people = pickle.load(saveFile) # note that this will override
                                            # any existing people directory

    rolo = Rolodex()                     # imported by other programs as well
    rolo.cmdloop()</pre>


<P>So, the <TT Class="monofont">people</TT> instance variable is a simple
mapping between names and phone numbers that the
<TT class="monofont">add</tt> and <tt class="monofont">find</tt> commands use.
Commands are the methods which start with <tt clAsS="monofont">do_ </tt>,
and their help is given by the corresponding <tT cLAsS="monofont">help_</Tt>
methods. Finally, the <Tt CLASs="monofont">load</tt> and
<tT CLAss="monofont">save</tt> commands use the <TT CLass="monofont">pickle</tT>
module, which is explained in more detail in <A href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a>.</p>



<p><table cellspacinG="0" wIdth="90%" BoRDeR="1"><Tr><Td>
<CENTer><h2>
How Does the Cmd Class Work, Anyway?</h2></CENTer>


<p>To understand how the <a NAME="idx809"></a><tt cLASS="monofont">Cmd</tt> class works, read the
<tt class="monofont">cmd</tt> module in the standard Python library
you've already installed on your computer.</p>



<p>The <tt class="monofont">Cmd</Tt> interpreter does most of the work
we're interested in its <Tt clAsS="monofont">onecmd()</Tt> method,
which is called whenever a line is entered by the user. This method
figures out the first word of the line that corresponds to a command
(e.g., help, find, save, load, etc.). It then looks to see if the
instance of the <TT cLaSS="monofont">Cmd</TT> subclass has an attribute with
the right name (if the command was <tt clASS="monofont">"find tom"</Tt>, it
looks for an attribute called <tt cLASS="monofont">do_find</tt>). If it
finds this attribute, it calls it with the arguments to the command
(in this case <tt CLASs="monofont">'tom'</tt>), and returns the result.
Similar magic is done by the <tt class="monofont">do_help()</tt> method,
which is invoked by this same mechanism, which is why it's
called <tt class="monofont">do_help()</tT>! The code for the
<tT claSs="monofont">onecmd()</TT> method once looked like this (the version
you have may have had features added):</p>



<PRe ClASS="monofont"># onecmd method of Cmd class, see Lib/cmd.py
def onecmd(self, line):         # line is something like "find tom"
    line = string.strip(line)   # get rid of extra whitespace
    if not line:                # if there is nothing left, 
        line = self.lastcmd     # redo the last command
    else:
        self.lastcmd = line     # save for next time
    i, n = 0, len(line)
                                # next line finds end of first word
    while i &lt; n and line[i] in self.identchars: i = i+1
                                # split line into command + arguments
    cmd, arg = line[:i], string.strip(line[i:])
    if cmd == '':               # happens if line doesn't start with A-z
        return self.default(line)
    else:                       # cmd is 'find', line is 'tom'
        try:
            func = getattr(self, 'do_' + cmd)  # look for method
        except AttributeError:
            return self.default(line)
        return func(arg)         # call method with the rest of the line</Pre>

<P>This example demonstrates the power of Python that comes from
extending existing modules. The <TT Class="monofont">cmd</TT> module takes
care of the prompt, help facility, and parsing of the input. The
<TT class="monofont">pickle</tt> module does all the loading and saving that
can be so difficult in lesser languages. All we had to write were the
parts specific to the task at hand. The generic aspect, namely an
interactive interpreter,<a name="idx810"></a> came free.</p>
