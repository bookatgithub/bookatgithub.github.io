<a naME="idx817"></A> <A name="idx818"></A>The scenario we use for this
example is that of a startup company, Joe's Toothpaste, Inc.,
which sells the latest in 100% organic, cruelty-free tofu-based
toothpaste. Since there is only one employee, and that employee is
quite busy shopping for the best tofu he can find, the tube
doesn't say "For customer complaints or comments, call
1-800-TOFTOOT," but instead, says "If you have a
complaint or wish to make a comment, visit our web site at
<I>www.toftoot.com</I>." The web site has all the
usual glossy pictures and an area where the customer can enter a
complaint or comment. This page looks like that in <A href="lpython_snode105.html#4">Figure 10.1</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><P>The <TT Class="monofont">FORM</tt> line specifies what CGI program should be
invoked when the form is submitted; specifically, the URL points to a
script called <i>feedback.py</i>, which we'll
cover in detail.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <tt clasS="monofont">INPUT</tt> tags indicate the names of the fields in
the form (<TT clAss="monofont">name</tT>, <Tt cLASS="monofont">address</Tt>,
<tt cLASS="monofont">email</tt>, and <tt CLASs="monofont">text</tt>, as well as
<tT CLAss="monofont">type</tt>). The values of those fields are whatever the
user enters, except for the case of <tt class="monofont">type</tt>, which
takes either the value <tt class="monofont">'comment'</Tt> or
<tT ClaSs="monofont">'complaint'</tt>, depending on which radio button the

</Li>
<lI><P>Finally, the <TT Class="monofont">INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT</TT> tag is for the
submission button, which actually calls the CGI script.</P>
</Li>
</ul>
<p>We now get to the interesting part as far as Python is concerned: the
processing of the request. Here is the entire
<I>feedback.py</I> program:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">import cgi, os, sys, string

    print "help us with our karma."
    print "&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for the feedback!&lt;p&gt;"
    print "And feel free to enter more comments if you wish."

    print "regarding our product__We'll read your comments"
    print "carefully and will be in touch with you."

    print 'Go back to the form&lt;/a&gt;'
    sys.exit()

class FormData:
    """ A repository for information gleaned from a CGI form """
    def __init__(self, form):
        for fieldname in self.fieldnames:
            if not form.has_key(fieldname) or form[fieldname].value == "":
                bail()
            else:
                setattr(self, fieldname, form[fieldname].value)
        
class FeedbackData(FormData):
    """ A FormData generated by the comment.html form. """
    fieldnames = ('name', 'address', 'email', 'type', 'text')
    def __repr__(self):
        return "%(type)s from %(name)s on %(time)s" % vars(self)

DIRECTORY = r'C:\complaintdir'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.stderr = sys.stdout 
<b>    form = cgi.FieldStorage()</b>
    data = FeedbackData(form)
    if data.type == 'comment':
        gush(data)
    else:

    # save the data to file

    tempfile.tempdir = DIRECTORY
    data.time = time.asctime(time.localtime(time.time()))
    pickle.dump(data, open(tempfile.mktemp(), 'w'))</pre>


<p>The output of this script clearly depends on the input, but the
output with the form filled out with the parameters shown in <a href="lpython_snode105.html#4">Figure 10.1</a> is displayed in <a href="lpython_snode105.html#6">Figure 10.2</A>.</p>

<p>How does the <i>feedback.py</i> script work? There are
a few aspects of the script common to all CGI programs, and those are
highlighted in bold. To start, the first line of the program needs to
refer to the Python executable. This is a requirement of the web
server we're using here, and it might not apply in your case;
even if it does, the specific location of your Python program is
likely to be different from this. The second line includes
<tt class="monofont">import</tt> <tt clAss="monofont">cgi</TT>, which,
appropriately enough, loads a module called <tt ClasS="monofont">cgi</Tt>
that deals with the hard part of CGI, such as parsing the environment
variables and handling escaped characters. (If you've never had
to do these things by hand, consider yourself lucky.) The
documentation for the <tT CLASs="monofont">cgi</tt> module describes a very
straightforward and easy way to use it. For this example, however,
mostly because we're going to build on it, the script is
somewhat more complicated than strictly necessary.</p>



<P>Let's just go through the code in the <TT Class="monofont">if </TT>_
_<TT clasS="monofont">name</TT>__<Tt class="monofont"> == '</tt>_
_<tt class="monofont">main</tt>__<tt cLasS="monofont">'</Tt> block one statement
at a time.<fOnt sIZe="1"><sUP><A HRef="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></sUP></FOnt>
 The
first statement redirects the <tt CLASs="monofont">sys.stderr</tt> stream to
whatever standard out is. This is done for debugging because the
output of the <tT CLAss="monofont">stdout</tt> stream in a CGI program goes
back to the web browser, and the <tt class="monofont">stderr</tt> stream
goes to the server's error log, which can be harder to read
than simply looking at the web page. This way, if a runtime exception
occurs, we can see it on the web page, as opposed to having to guess
what it was. The second line is crucial and does all of the hard CGI
work: it returns a dictionary-like object (called a
<tt class="monofont">FieldStorage</Tt> object) whose keys are the names of
the variables filled out in the form, and whose value can be obtained
by asking for the <tT ClaSs="monofont">value</tt> attribute of the entries
in the <TT clASS="monofont">FieldStorage</TT> object. Sounds complicated,
but all it means is that for our form, the <tt clASS="monofont">form</Tt>
object has keys <tt cLASS="monofont">'name'</tt>, <tt CLASs="monofont">'type'</tt>,
<tt class="monofont">'email'</tt>, <tt class="monofont">'address'</tT>, and
<tt CLasS="monofont">'text'</tt>, and that to find out what the user entered
in the Name field of the web form, we need to look at
<tT ClaSS="monofont">form['name'].value</TT>.</P>


<blocKQUOte><foNT SIze="1">
<p cLASS="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></sup>
You'll remember that this
<tt class="monofont">if</tT> statement is true only when the program is run
as a script, not when it's imported. CGI programs qualify as
scripts, so the code in the <tt CLasS="monofont">if</tt> block runs when
this program is called by the web server. We use it later as an
imported script, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
</FOnt></BLOCKquotE>





<P>The third line in the <TT clasS="monofont">if</TT> block creates an instance
of our user-defined class <Tt claSS="monofont">FeedbackData</TT>, passing it
the <tt class="monofont">form</tt> object as an argument. If you now look at
the definition of the <tt class="monofont">FeedbackData</tt> class,
you'll see that it's a very simple subclass of
<tt ClaSS="monofont">FormData</tt>, which is also a user-defined class. All
we've defined in the <Tt clASs="monofont">FeedbackData</tT> subclass
is a class attribute <TT CLass="monofont">fieldnames</tT> and a _
_<TT Class="monofont">repr</TT>__ function used by the
<TT clasS="monofont">print</TT> statement, among others. Clearly, the _
_<Tt class="monofont">init</tt>__ method of the <tt class="monofont">FormData</tt>
class must do something with the <tt cLasS="monofont">FieldStorage</Tt>
argument. Indeed, it looks at each of the field names defined in the
<tT claSS="monofont">fieldnames</tt> class attribute of the instance
(that's what <TT CLAss="monofont">self.fieldnames</tt> refers to), and
for each field name, checks to see that the
<TT CLass="monofont">FieldStorage</tT> object has a corresponding nonempty
key. If it does, it sets an attribute with the same name as the field
in the instance, giving it as value the text entered by the user. If
it doesn't, it calls the <TT Class="monofont">bail</TT> function.</P>



<P>We'll get to what <tt class="monofont">bail</tt> does in a minute, but
first, let's walk through the usual case, when the user
dutifully enters all of the required data. In those cases,
<tt class="monofont">FieldStorage</tt> has all of the keys
(<tt ClaSS="monofont">'name'</tt>, <Tt clASs="monofont">'type'</tT>, etc.) which
the <TT CLass="monofont">FeedbackData</tT> class says it needs. The
<TT Class="monofont">FormData</TT> class __<TT clasS="monofont">init</TT>__
method in turn sets attributes for each field name in the instance.
So, when the <Tt class="monofont">data</tt> <tt class="monofont">=</tt>
<tt cLasS="monofont">FeedbackData(form)</Tt> call returns,
<tT claSS="monofont">data</tt> is guaranteed to be an instance of
<TT CLAss="monofont">FeedbackData</tt>, which is a subclass of
<TT CLass="monofont">FormData</tT>, and <TT Class="monofont">data</TT> has the
attributes <TT class="monofont">name</tt>, <tt class="monofont">type</tt>,
<tt clAss="monofont">email</TT>, etc., with the corresponding values the
user entered.</p>



<p>A similar effect could have been gotten with code like:</P>



<pre CLasS="monofont">form = cgi.FieldStorage()
form_ok = 1
if not form.has_key("name") or form["name"].value == "":
    form_ok = 0
else:
    data_name = form["name"].value
if not form.has_key("email") or form["email"].value == "":
    form_ok = 0
else:
    data_email = form["email"].value
...</PRE>


<P>but it should be clear that this kind of programming can get very
tedious, repetitive, and error-prone (thanks to the curse of cut and
paste). With our scheme, when Joe changes the set of field names in
the web page, all we need to change is the
<tt clASS="monofont">fieldnames</Tt> attribute of the
<tt cLASS="monofont">FeedbackData</tt> class. Also, we can use the same
<tt CLASs="monofont">FormData</tt> class in any other CGI script, and thus
reuse code.</p>



<p>What if the user didn't enter all of the required fields?
Either the <tt class="monofont">FieldStorage</tt> dictionary will be missing
a key, or its value will be the empty string. The
<tt clasS="monofont">FormData.</tt>__<TT clAss="monofont">init</tT>__ method then
calls the <Tt cLASS="monofont">bail</Tt> function, which displays a polite
error message and exits the script. Control never returns back to the
main program, so there is no need to test the validity of the
<tt cLASS="monofont">data</tt> variable; if we got something back from
<tt CLASs="monofont">FeedbackData()</tt>, it's a valid instance.</p>



<P>With the <TT Class="monofont">data</tt> instance, we check to see if the
feedback type was a comment, in which case we thank the user for
their input. If the feedback type was a complaint, we apologize
profusely and promise to get back in touch with them.</p>



<p>We now have a basic CGI infrastructure in place. To save the data to
file is remarkably easy. First, we define the
<tt class="monofont">DIRECTORY</tt> variable outside the
<tt cLasS="monofont">if</Tt> test because we'll use it from another
script that will import this one, so we wish it to be defined even if
this script is not run as a program.</p>



<P>Stepping through the last few lines of
<i>feedback.py</i>:</p>



<UL>
<li><P>Import the <TT CLass="monofont">tempfile</tT>,
<TT Class="monofont">pickle</TT>, and <TT clasS="monofont">time</TT> modules. The
<Tt class="monofont">tempfile</tt>
<a name="idx819"></a> module, as we've seen in previous
chapters, comes up with filenames currently not in use; that way we
don't need to worry about "collisions" in any
filename generation scheme. The
<tt clasS="monofont">pickle</tt>
<A NamE="idx820"></a> module allows the serialization, or
saving, of any Python object. The
<tt CLasS="monofont">time</TT>
<A Name="idx821"></a> module lets us find the current time,
which Joe judges to be an important aspect of the feedback.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>The next line sets the <tt CLASs="monofont">tempdir</tt> attribute of the
<tT CLAss="monofont">tempfile</tt> module to the value of the
<tt class="monofont">DIRECTORY</tt> variable, which is where we want our
data to be saved. This is an example of customizing an existing
module by directly modifying its namespace, just as we modified the
<tt class="monofont">stderr</Tt> attribute of the <tT ClaSs="monofont">sys</tt>
module earlier.</P>
</Li>
<lI><P>The next line uses several functions in the <TT Class="monofont">time</TT>
module to provide a string representation of the current date and
time (something like <TT clasS="monofont">'Sat Jul 04 18:09:00 1998'</TT>,
which is precise enough for Joe's needs), and creates a new
attribute called <Tt claSS="monofont">time</TT> in the
<tt class="monofont">data</tt> instance. It is therefore saved along with
<tt class="monofont">data</tt>.</p>
</lI>
<li><P>The last line does the actual saving; it opens the file with a name
generated by the <Tt cLass="monofont">tempfile</TT> module in write mode and
dumps the instance data into it. That's it! Now the specified
file contains a so-called "pickled"<a nAME="idx822"></A> instance.<A name="idx823"></A></P>
