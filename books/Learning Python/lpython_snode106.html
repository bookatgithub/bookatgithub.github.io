<h3>10.2
Interfacing with COM: Cheap Public Relations</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx824"></a>We
use the data to do two things. First, we'll write a program
that's run periodically (say, at 2 a.m., every night<fonT SIZe="1"><sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a></sup></font>
) and looks through the
saved data, finds out which saved pickled files correspond to
complaints, and prints out a customized letter to the complainant.
Sounds sophisticated, but you'll be surprised at how simple it
is using the right tools. Joe's web site is on a Windows
machine, so we'll assume that for this program, but other
platforms work in similar ways.</p>


<blockquote><FoNt siZe="1">
<P ClASs="footnote">
<SuP><A NAme="FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a></sUP>
Setting up this kind of automatic regularly scheduled program
is easily done on most platforms, using, for example,
<TT clasS="monofont">cron</TT> on Unix or the <Tt claSS="monofont">AT</TT>
scheduler on Windows NT.</p>
</font></blockquote>





<p>Before we talk about how to write this program, a word about the
technology it uses, namely<a namE="idx825"></a> Microsoft's Common
Object Model (COM). <A namE="idx826"></a>COM is a standard for interaction
between programs (an <A NaME="idx827"></a>Object Request Broker service, to be
technical), which allows any COM-compliant program to talk to, access
the data in, and execute commands in other COM-compliant programs.
Grossly, the program doing the calling is called a COM client, and
the program doing the executing is called a COM server. Now, as one
might suspect given the origin of COM, all major Microsoft products
are COM-aware, and most can act as servers. Microsoft Word Version 8
is one of those, and the one we'll use here. Indeed, Microsoft
Word is just fine for writing letters, which is what we're
doing. Luckily for us, Python can be made COM-aware as well, at least
on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. Mark
<A nAME="idx828"></A>Hammond and
Greg <a namE="idx829"></A>Stein have
made available a set of extensions to Python for Windows
called<A Name="idx830"></a>
<I>win32com</I> that allow Python programs to do almost
everything you can do with COM from any other language. You can write
COM clients, servers, ActiveX scripting hosts, debuggers, and more,
all in Python. We only need to do the first of these, which is also
the simplest. Basically, our form letter program needs to do the
following things:</P>



<Ol typE="1">
<LI><P>Open all of the pickled files in the appropriate directory and
unpickle them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each unpickled instance file, test if the feedback is a
complaint. If it is, find out the name and address of the person who
filled out the form and go on to Step 3. If not, skip it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open a Word document containing a template of the letter we want to
send, and fill in the appropriate pieces with the customized
information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>	Print the document and close it.</p>
</lI>
</oL>

<p>It's almost as simple in Python with
<i>win32com</i>
<A nAMe="idx831"></A> <A nAmE="idx832"></A> <A Name="idx833"></a>.
Here's a little program called <I>formletter.py
</I>:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont"><B>from win32com.client import constants, Dispatch</b>
<b>WORD = 'Word.Application.8'</b>
False, True = 0, -1
import string

class Word:
    def __init__(self):
<b>        self.app = Dispatch(WORD)</B>
    def open(self, doc):
        self.app.Documents.Open(FileName=doc)
    def replace(self, source, target):
        self.app.Selection.HomeKey(Unit=constants.wdLine)
        find = self.app.Selection.Find
        find.Text = "%"+source+"%"
        self.app.Selection.Find.Execute()
        self.app.Selection.TypeText(Text=target)
    def printdoc(self):
        self.app.Application.PrintOut()
    def close(self):
        self.app.ActiveDocument.Close(SaveChanges=False)

def print_formletter(data):
    word.open(r"h:\David\Book\tofutemplate.doc")
    word.replace("name", data.name)
    word.replace("address", data.address)
    word.replace("firstname", string.split(data.name)[0])
    word.printdoc()
    word.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import os, pickle
    from feedback import DIRECTORY, FormData, FeedbackData
<B>    word = Word()</B>
    for filename in os.listdir(DIRECTORY):
        data = pickle.load(open(os.path.join(DIRECTORY, filename)))
        if data.type == 'complaint':
            print "Printing letter for %(name)s." % vars(data)
            print_formletter(data)
        else:
            print "Got comment from %(name)s, skipping printing." % vars(data)</Pre>


<p>The first few lines of the main program show the power of a
well-designed framework. The first line is a standard import
statement, except that it's worth noting that
<i>win32com</i> is a package, not a module. It is, in
fact, a collection of subpackages, modules, and functions. We need
two things from
the<a name="idx834"></a> <i>win32com</i>
package: the <tt class="monofont">Dispatch</Tt> function in the
<Tt clAsS="monofont">client</Tt> module, a function that allows us to
"dispatch" functions to other objects (in this case COM
servers), and the <TT cLaSS="monofont">constants</TT> submodule of the same
module, which holds the constants defined by the COM objects we want
to talk to.</p>



<p>The second line simply defines a variable that contains the name of
the COM server we're interested in. It's called
<tt CLASs="monofont">Word.Application.8</tt>
<a NAME="idx835"></a>
<a naME="idx836"></A>
<A name="idx837"></a>,
as you can find out from using a COM browser or reading Word's
API (see the sidebar <a href="lpython_snode106.html#4">Finding Out About COM Interfaces</a>).</p>



<p>Let's focus now on the<tt class="monofont"> if </Tt>_
_<Tt clAsS="monofont">name</Tt>__<TT cLaSS="monofont"> == '</TT>_
_<tt clASS="monofont">main</Tt>__<tt cLASS="monofont">'</tt> block, which is the
next statement after the class and function definitions.</p>



<p>The first task is to read the data. We import the
<TT CLass="monofont">os</tt>
<a name="idx838"></a> and
<tt class="monofont">pickle</tt>
<A nAme="idx839"></a> modules for fairly obvious reasons, and
then three references from the <Tt CLaSS="monofont">feedback</tT> module we
just wrote: the <tT CLAss="monofont">DIRECTORY</tt> where the data is stored
(this way if we change it in <I>feedback.py</I>, this
module reflects the change the next time it's run), and the
<TT clasS="monofont">FormData</TT> and <Tt claSS="monofont">FeedbackData</TT>
classes. The next line creates an instance of the
<tt class="monofont">Word</tt> class; this opens a connection with the Word
COM server, starting the server if needed.</p>



<p>The <tt class="monofont">for</tt> loop is a simple iteration over the files
in the directory with all the saved files. It's important that
this directory contain only the pickled instances, since we're
not doing any error checking. As usual we should make the code more
robust, but we've ignored stability for simplicity.</P>



<p>The first line in the <Tt clAsS="monofont">for</Tt> loop does the
unpickling. It uses the <TT cLaSS="monofont">load</TT> function from the
<tt clASS="monofont">pickle</Tt> module, which takes a single argument, the
file which is being unpickled. It returns as many references as were
stored in the file—in our case, just one. Now, the data that
was stored was just the instance of the
<tt cLASS="monofont">FeedbackData</tt> class. The definition of the class
itself isn't stored in the pickled file, just the instance
values and a reference to the class.<foNT SIze="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a></sup></font>
</p>


<bLoCkquOtE><FoNT sIzE="1">
<P CLass="footnote">
<sUP><A Name="FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a></SUP>
There are very
good reasons for this behavior: first, it reduces the total size of
pickled objects, and more importantly, it allows you to unpickle
instances of previous versions of a class and automatically upgrade
them to the newer class definitions.</P>

<P>At unpickling time, unpickling instances automatically causes an
import of the module in which the class was defined. Why, then, did
we need to import the classes specifically? In <a href="lpython_cnode52.html">Chapter 5</A>, we said the name of the currently running
module is __m<tT ClASs="monofont">ain</Tt>__. In other words, the name of
the module in which the class is defined is _
_<TT CLass="monofont">main</tT>__ (even though the name of the file is
<I>feedback.py</I>), and alas, importing _
_<Tt claSS="monofont">main</TT>__ when we're unpickling imports the
currently running module (which lives in
<i>formletter.py</i>), which doesn't contain the
definition of the classes of the pickled instances. This is why we
need to import the class definitions explicitly from the
<tt CLASs="monofont">feedback</tt> module. If they weren't made
available to the code calling <tt class="monofont">pickle.unload</tt> (in
either the local or global namespaces), the unpickling would fail.
Alternatively, we could save the source of the class in a file and
import it first before any of the instances, or, even more simply,
place the class definitions in a separate module that's
imported explicitly by <i>feedback.py</i> and
implicitly by the unpickling process in the
<i>formletter.py</i>. The latter is the usual case, and
as a result, in most circumstances, you don't need to
explicitly import the class definitions; unpickling the instance does
it all, "by magic."<font SiZe="1"><suP><a HReF="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</A></sUp></FONT>

<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a></sup>
This point about
pickling of top-level classes is a subtle one; it's much beyond
the level of this book. We mention it here because 1) we need to
explain the code we used, and 2) this is about as complex as Python
gets. In some ways this should be comforting—there is really no
"magic" here. The apparently special-case behavior of
<tt class="monofont">pickle</Tt> is in fact a natural consequence of
understanding what the __<Tt clAsS="monofont">main</Tt>__ module
is.</P>

<p>The <tt class="monofont">if</tt> statement inside the loop is
straightforward. All that remains is to explain is the
<tt class="monofont">print_formletter</Tt> function, and, of course, the
<Tt clAsS="monofont">Word</Tt> class.</P>



<P>The <tT cLASS="monofont">print_formletter</tt> function simply calls the
various methods of the <tt CLASs="monofont">word</tt> instance of the
<tT CLAss="monofont">Word</tt> class with the data extracted from the
<TT CLass="monofont">data</tt> instance. Note that we use the
<tt class="monofont">string.split</tt> function to extract the first name of
the user, just to make the letter more friendly, but this risks
strange behavior for nonstandard names.</p>



<p>In the <tt clAsS="monofont">Word</tt> class, the __<tT cLAsS="monofont">init</Tt>_
_ method appears simple yet hides a lot of work. It creates a
connection with the COM server and stores a reference to that COM
server in an instance variable <Tt CLASs="monofont">app</tt>. Now, there are
two ways in which the subsequent code might use this server:
<i>dynamic dispatch</I> and <I>nondynamic
dispatch</I>. In dynamic dispatch, Python doesn't
"know" at the time the program is running what the
interface to the COM server (in this case Microsoft Word) is. It
doesn't matter, because COM allows Python to interrogate the
server and determine the protocol, for example, the number and kinds
of arguments each function expects. This approach can be slow,
however. A way to speed it up is to run the
<I>makepy.py</i>
<a naME="idx840"></A> program, which does this once for each
specified COM server and stores this information on disk. When a
program using that specific server is executed, the dispatch routine
uses the precomputed information rather than doing the dynamic
dispatch. The program as written works in both cases. If
<I>makepy.py</i> was run on Word in the past, the fast
dispatch method is used; if not, the dynamic dispatch method is used.
For more information on these issues, see the information for the

extensions at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/windows/win32all/default.htm">http://www.python.org/windows/win32all/</a>.</p>



<P>To explain the <tT claSs="monofont">Word</TT> class methods, let's
start with a possible template document, so that we can see what
needs to be done to it to customize it. It's shown in <a href="lpython_snode106.html#3">Figure 10.3</a>.</P>



<CENter>
<h5>

<p>As you can see, it's a pretty average document, with the
exception of some text in between <Tt ClasS="monofont">%</tT> signs.
We've used this notation just to make it easy for a program to
find the parts which need customization, but any other technique
could work as well. To use this template, we need to open the
document, customize it, print it, and close it. Opening it is done by
the <Tt CLaSs="monofont">open</TT> method of the <TT clasS="monofont">Word</TT>
class. The printing and closing are done similarly. To customize, we
replace the <Tt claSS="monofont">%name%</TT>,
<tt clASS="monofont">%firstname%</Tt>, and <tt class="monofont">%address%</tt> text
with the appropriate strings. That's what the
<tt class="monofont">replace</tt> method of the <tT cLass="monofont">Word</Tt>
class does (we won't cover how we figured out what the exact
sequence of calls should be; see <A href="lpython_snode106.html#4">Finding Out About COM Interfaces</a> for details).</P>



<p><A NAMe="4"></a><taBLE CellsPACIng="0" wiDTH="90%" Border="1"><tr><td><center><h2>
Finding Out About COM Interfaces</h2></cenTeR>


<p><a nAmE="idx940"></A><a NAmE="idx941"></a>How can you find out what the various methods and attributes of COM
objects are? In general, COM objects are just like any other program;
they should come with documentation. In the case of COM objects,
however, it's quite possible to have the software without the
documentation, simply because, as in the case of Word, it's
possible to use Word without needing to program it. There are three
strategies available to you if you want to explore a COM interface:</P>



<UL>
<Li><p>Find or buy the documentation; some COM programs have their
documentation available on the Web, or available in printed form.</p>
</lI>
<LI><P>Use a COM browser to explore the objects. Pythonwin (part of the
<i>win32all</i> extensions to Python on Windows, see
<a href="lpython_cnode123.html">Appendix B</A>), for example, comes with a COM browser
tool that lets you explore the complex hierarchy of COM objects.
It's not much more than a listing of available objects and
functions, but sometimes that's all you need. Development tools
such as Microsoft's Visual Studio also come with COM browsers.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Use another tool to find what's available. For the example
above, we simply used Microsoft Word's "macro
recorder" facility to produce a VBA (Visual Basic for
Applications) script, which is fairly straightforward to translate to
Python. Macros tend to be fairly low-intelligence programs, meaning
that the macro-recording facility can't pick up on the fact
that you might want to do something 10 times, and so just records the
same action multiple times. But they work fine for finding out that
the equivalent of selecting the Print item of the File menu is to
"say" <TT class="monofont">ActiveDocument.PrintOut()</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></tablE></p>


<P>Putting all of this at work, the program, when run, outputs text like:</p>



<prE cLAsS="monofont">C:\Programs&gt; <B>python formletter.py</b></PrE>

<PRE clasS="monofont">Printing letter for John Doe.
Got comment from Your Mom, skipping printing.
Printing letter for Susan B. Anthony.</PRE>


<p>and prints two customized letters, ready to be sent in the mail. Note
that the Word program doesn't show up on the desktop; by
default, COM servers are invisible, so Word just acts behind the
scenes. If Word is currently active on the desktop, each step is
visible to the user (one more reason why it's good to run these
things after hours).<a naME="idx843"></A></P>
