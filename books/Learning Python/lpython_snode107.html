<h3>10.3
A Tkinter-Based GUI Editor for Managing Form Data</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx844"></a>Let's
recap: we wrote a CGI program (<i>feedback.py</i>) that
takes the input from a web form and stores the information on disk on
our server. We then wrote a program
(<i>formletter.py</I>) that takes some of those files
and generates apologies to those deserving them. The next task is to
construct a program to allow a human to look at the comments and
complaints, using the Tkinter toolkit to build a GUI browser for
these files.</P>



<P>The Tkinter toolkit is a Python-specific interface to a non-Python
GUI library called Tk. Tk is the de facto choice for most Python
users because it provides professional-looking GUIs within a fairly
easy-to-use system. The interfaces it generates don't look
exactly like Windows, the Mac, or any Unix toolkit, but they look
very close to each of them, and the same Python program works on all
those platforms, which is basically impossible with any
platform-specific toolkit. Another portable toolkit worth considering
is wxPython (<A targET="_blank" HRef="http://www.alldunn.com/wxPython">http://www.alldunn.com/wxPython</a>).</p>



<p>Tk, then, is what we'll use in this example. It's a
toolkit developed by John <a name="idx845"></a>Ousterhout, originally as a companion to
Tcl, another scripting language. Since then, Tk has been adopted by
many other scripting languages including Python and Perl. For more
information on Perl and Tk, see O'Reilly's
<i>Learning Perl/Tk</i> by Nancy Walsh.</p>



<p>The goals of this program are simple: to display in a window a
listing of all of the feedback data items, allowing the user to
select one to examine in greater detail (e.g., seeing the contents of
the text widget). Furthermore, Joe wants to be able to discard items
that are dealt with, to avoid having an always increasing list of
items. A screenshot of the finished program in action is shown in
<a href="lpython_snode107.html#2">Figure 10.4</A>.</p>

<IMg borDER="0" Width="503" HEIGht="282" src="FILES/lpy_1004.gif" ALT="figs/lpy_1004.gif"></center>


<p>We'll work through one possible way of coding it. Our entire
program, called
<i>feedbackeditor</i>.<i>py,</i> is:</p>



<pre class="monofont">from FormEditor import FormEditor
from feedback import FeedbackData, FormData 
from Tkinter import mainloop
FormEditor("Feedback Editor", FeedbackData, r"c:\Complaintdir")
mainloop()</PrE>


<p>This is cheating only if we don't tell you what's in
<i>FormEditor</i>, but we will. The point of breaking
these four lines out into a separate file is that we've broken
out all that is specific to our form. As we'll see, the
<I>FormEditor</i>
<A NaME="idx846"></a> program is completely independent of
the specific CGI form. A further point made explicit by this
microprogram is that it shows how to interact with Tkinter; you
create widgets and windows, and then call the
<I>mainloop</i> function, which sets the GUI running.
Every change in the program that follows happens as a result of GUI
actions. As for <I>formletter.py</I>, this program
imports the class objects from the <TT clasS="monofont">feedback</TT>
module, for the same reason (unpickling). Then, an instance of the
<Tt claSS="monofont">FormEditor</TT> class is created, passing to its
initialization function the name of the editor, the class of the
objects being unpickled, and the location of the pickled instances.</p>



<p>The<a nAME="idx847"></A> code for
<tt class="monofont">FormEditor</tt> is just a class definition, which
we'll describe in parts, one method at a time. First, the
import statements and the initialization method:</p>



<pre class="monofont">from Tkinter import *
import string, os, pickle

class FormEditor:
    def __init__(self, name, dataclass, storagedir):
        self.storagedir = storagedir      # stash away some references
        self.dataclass = dataclass
        self.row = 0
        self.current = None

        self.root = root = Tk()           # create window and size it
        root.minsize(300,200)

        root.rowconfigure(0, weight=1)    # define how columns and rows scale
        root.columnconfigure(0, weight=1) # when the window is resized
        root.columnconfigure(1, weight=2)
        
        # create the title Label
        Label(root, text=name, font='bold').grid(columnspan=2)
        self.row = self.row + 1 
        # create the main listbox and configure it
        self.listbox = Listbox(root, selectmode=SINGLE)
        self.listbox.grid(columnspan=2,sticky=E+W+N+S)
        self.listbox.bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;', self.select)
        self.row = self.row + 1

    # call self.add_variable once per variable in the class's fieldnames var
        for fieldname in dataclass.fieldnames:
            setattr(self, fieldname, self.add_variable(root, fieldname))

    # create a couple of buttons, with assigned commands
        self.add_button(self.root, self.row, 0, 'Delete Entry', self.delentry)
        self.add_button(self.root, self.row, 1, 'Reload', self.load_data)

        self.load_data()</prE>


<p>We use the sometimes dangerous <Tt clAsS="monofont">from ... import *</Tt>
construct we warned you about earlier. In Tkinter programs,
it's usually fairly safe, because Tkinter only exports
variables that are fairly obviously GUI-related
(<TT cLaSS="monofont">Label</TT>, <tt clASS="monofont">Widget</Tt>, etc.), and they
all start with uppercase letters.</p>



<p>Understanding the<tT CLAss="monofont"> </tt>__<TT CLass="monofont">init</tt>__
method is best done by comparing the structure of the code to the
structure of the window screen dump. As you move down the _
_<tt class="monofont">init</tt>__ method lines, you should be able to match
many statements with their graphical consequences.</p>



<p>The first few lines simply stash away a few things in instance
variables and assign default values to variables. The next set of
lines access a so-called <tt clAsS="monofont">Toplevel</tt> widget
(basically, a window; the <tT cLAsS="monofont">Tk()</Tt> call returns the
currently defined top-level widget), sets its minimum size, and sets
a few properties. The row and column configuration options allow the
widgets inside the window to scale if the user enlarges the window
and determines the relative width of the two columns of internal
widgets.</P>



<p>The next call creates a <TT CLass="monofont">Label</tT> widget, which is
defined in the <TT Class="monofont">Tkinter</TT> module, and which, as you
can see in the screen dump, is just a text label. It spans both
columns of widgets, meaning that it extends from the leftmost edge of
the window to the rightmost edge. Specifying the locations of
graphical elements is responsible for the majority of GUI calls, due
to the wide array of possible arrangements.</P>



<P>The <tt clASS="monofont">Listbox</Tt> widget is created next; it's a
list of text lines, which can be selected by the user using arrow
keys and the mouse button. This specific listbox allows only one line
to be selected at a time (<tt class="monofont">selectmode=SINGLE</tt>) and
fills all the space available to it (the <tt class="monofont">sticky</tt>
option).</p>



<P>The <tT claSs="monofont">for</TT>
<a NAmE="idx848"></a>
loop block is the most interesting bit of code in the method; by
iterating over the <TT CLass="monofont">fieldnames</tT> attribute of the
<TT Class="monofont">dataclass</TT> variable (in our example, the
<TT clasS="monofont">fieldnames</TT> class of the
<Tt class="monofont">FeedbackData</tt> class), it finds out which variables
are in the instance data, and for each, calls the
<tt class="monofont">add_variable</tt> method of the
<tt cLaSs="monofont">FormEditor</tt> class and takes the returned value and
stuffs it in an instance variable. This is equivalent in our case to:</P>



<pRE cLAsS="monofont">...
self.name = self.add_variable(root, 'name')
self.email = self.add_variable(root, 'email')
self.address = self.add_variable(root, 'address')
self.type = self.add_variable(root, 'type')
self.text = self.add_variable(root, 'text')</pRE>


<P>The version in the code sample, however, is better, because the list
of field names is already available to the program and retyping
anything is usually an indicator of bad design. Furthermore, there is
nothing about <Tt claSS="monofont">FormData</TT> that is specific to our
specific forms. It can be used to browse any instance of a class that
defines a variable <tt clASS="monofont">fieldnames</Tt>. Making the program
generic like this makes it more likely to be reused in other contexts
for other tasks.</p>



<p>Finishing off with the __<tT CLAss="monofont">init</tt>__ method, we see
that two buttons finish the graphical layout of the window, each
associated with a command that's executed when it's
clicked. One is the <tt class="monofont">delentry</tt> method, which deletes
the current entry, and the other is a reloading function that rereads
the data in the storage directory.</p>



<p>Finally, the data is loaded by a call to the
<tt claSs="monofont">load_data</Tt> method. We'll describe it as soon
as we're done with the calls that set up widgets, namely
<tt ClASs="monofont">add_variable</TT> and <tT cLASS="monofont">add_button</tt>.</p>



<p><TT CLass="monofont">add_variable</tT>
<A NAme="idx849"></a>
creates a <tT CLAss="monofont">Label</tt> widget, which displays the name of
the field, and on the same row, places a <tt class="monofont">Label</tt>
widget, which will contain the value of the corresponding field in
the entry selected in the listbox:</p>



<pre claSs="monofont">def add_variable(self, root, varname):
    Label(root, text=varname).grid(row=self.row, column=0, sticky=E)
    value = Label(root, text='', background='gray90',
                  relief=SUNKEN, anchor=W, justify=LEFT)
    value.grid(row=self.row, column=1, sticky=E+W)
    self.row = self.row + 1
    return value</Pre>


<p><Tt CLaSS="monofont">add_button</tT> is simpler, as it needs to create only
one widget:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">def add_button(self, root, row, column, text, command):
    button = Button(root, text=text, command=command)
    button.grid(row=row, column=column, sticky=E+W, padx=5, pady=5)</PRE>


<P>The <tt clASS="monofont">load_data</Tt>
<a naME="idx850"></A> function cleans up any contents in
the listbox (the graphical list of items) and resets the
<Tt class="monofont">items </tt>attribute (which is a Python list that will
contain references to the actual data instances). The loop is quite
similar to that used for <i>printcomplaints.py</i>,
except that:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>The name of the file in which an instance is stored is attached as an
attribute to that instance (we'll see why shortly)</p>
</li>
<lI><p>The instance is added to the items instance attribute</P>
</li>
<lI><p>The string representation of the item (note the use of the backtick
<TT cLAsS="monofont">`</tT>) is added to the listbox</P>
</LI>
<li><p>Finally, the first item in the listbox is selected:</p>
</LI>
</UL>
<pre cLASS="monofont">def load_data(self):
    self.listbox.delete(0,END)
    self.items = []
    for filename in os.listdir(self.storagedir):
        item = pickle.load(open(os.path.join(self.storagedir, filename)))
        item._filename = filename
        self.items.append(item)
        self.listbox.insert('end', `item`)
    self.listbox.select_set(0)
    self.select(None)</pre>


<p>We now get to the
<TT CLass="monofont">select</tt>
<a name="idx851"></a>
method we mentioned previously. It's called in one of two
circumstances. The first, as we just showed, is the last thing to
happen when the data is loaded. The second is a consequence of the
binding operation in the __<tt class="monofont">init</tt>__ method, which
we reprint here:</P>



<pRe clAsS="monofont">self.listbox.bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;', self.select)</PrE>


<P>This call binds the occurrence of a specific event
(<tT cLASS="monofont">'&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;'</tt>) in a specific widget
(<tt CLASs="monofont">self.listbox</tt>) to an action calling
<tT CLAss="monofont">self.select</tt>. In other words, whenever you let go
of the left mouse button on an item in the listbox, the
<TT CLass="monofont">select</tt> method of your editor is called. It's
called with an argument of type <tt class="monofont">Event</tt>, which can
let us know such things as when the button click occurred, but since
we don't need to know anything about the event except that it
occurred, we'll ignore it. What must happen on selection?
First, the instance corresponding to the item being selected in the
GUI element must be identified, and then the fields corresponding to
the values of that instance must be updated. This is performed by
iterating over each field name (looking back to the
<tt clasS="monofont">fieldnames</tT> class variable again), finding the
value of the field in the selected instance, and configuring the
appropriate label widget to display the right text:<fonT sIZe="1"><SUp><A hREF="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</A></sup></fONT>
</P>


<blocKQUOte><foNT SIze="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></sup>
The <Tt ClasS="monofont">replace</tT> operation is needed because Tk
treats the <Tt CLaSs="monofont">\r\n</TT> sequence that occurs on Windows
machines as two carriage returns instead of one.</P>
</Font></bLOCKquotE>





<PRE clasS="monofont">def select(self, event):
    selection = self.listbox.curselection()
    self.selection = self.items[int(selection[0])]
    for fieldname in self.dataclass.fieldnames:
        label = getattr(self, fieldname)               # GUI field
        labelstr = getattr(self.selection, fieldname)  # instance attribute
        labelstr = string.replace(labelstr,'\r', '')
        label.config(text=labelstr)</PRE>


<p>The reload functionality we need is exactly that of the
<tt class="monofont">load_data</tt>
<a name="idx852"></a> method, which is why that's
what was passed as the command to be called when the reload button is
clicked. The deletion of an entry, however, is a tad more difficult.
As we mentioned, the first thing to do when loading an instance from
disk is to give it an attribute that corresponds to the filename
whence it came. We use this information to delete the file before
asking for a reload; the listbox is automatically updated:</p>



<pre ClAss="monofont">def delentry(self):
    os.remove(os.path.join(self.storagedir,self.selection._filename))
    self.load_data()</pRe>


<P>This program is probably the hardest to understand of any in this
book, simply because it uses the complex and powerful Tkinter library
extensively. There is documentation for Tkinter, as well as for Tk
itself (see <A href="lpython_snode107.html#3">Tkinter Documentation</A>).</p>

<A NaMe="idx854"></A>The
documentation for Tkinter is as elusive as it is needed; it's
getting better all the time, however. Tkinter was originally written
by someone (Steen Lumholdt) who needed a GUI for his work with
Python. He didn't write much documentation, alas.  Tkinter has
since been upgraded many times over, mostly by Guido van Rossum. The
documentation for Tkinter is still incomplete; however, there are a
few pieces of documentation currently available, and by the time you
