<h3>10.4
Design Considerations</h3>


<p>Think of the <a NAME="idx856"></a> <a naME="idx857"></A>
<A name="idx858"></A>CGI script
<I>feedback.py</I> and the GUI program
<I>FormEditor.py</i> as two different ways of
manipulating a common dataset (the pickled instances on disk). When
should you use a web-based interface, and when should you use a GUI?
The choice should be based on a couple of factors:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>How easy is it to implement the needed functionality in a given
<a name="idx859"></a>framework?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What software can you require the user to install in order to access
or modify the data?</p>
</Li>
</Ul>
<p>The web frontend is therefore well suited to cases where the
complexity of the data manipulation requirements is low and where
it's more important that users be able to "work the
program" than that the program be full-featured. Building a
"real" program on top of a GUI toolkit, on the other
hand, allows maximum flexibility, at the cost of having to teach the
user how to use it and/or installing specific programs. One reason
for Python's success among experienced programmers is that
Python allows them to design programs based on such reasoned bases,
as opposed to forcing them to use one type of programming framework
just because it's what the language designer had in mind.
It's also possible to develop full-featured applications that
happen to use web browsers as their GUI.
<a NaME="idx860"></a>Zope is a framework for
writing such applications, and is available free from Digital
Creations under an Open Source license. If you're interested in
developing full-fledged web-based applications, give Zope a look (see
<A href="lpython_cnode114.html">Appendix A</A>, for more
details).<A NAme="idx861"></a></p>
