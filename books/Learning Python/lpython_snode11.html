<h3>1.1
Why Python?</h3>


<p>If you've bought this book, chances are you already know what
Python is, and why it's an important tool to learn. If not, you
probably won't be sold on Python until you've learned the
language by reading the rest of this book. But before jumping into
details, we'd like to use a few pages to briefly introduce some
of the main reasons behind Python's popularity. (Even if you
don't care for nontechnical overviews, your manager might.)</p>




<H4>1.1.1
An Executive Summary</H4>


<P>Python is perhaps best described as an object-oriented scripting
language: its design mixes software engineering features of
traditional languages with the usability of scripting languages. But
some of Python's best assets tell a more complete story.</P>




<h5>1.1.1.1
It's object-oriented</h5>


<p>Python is an <a NAME="idx2"></a>object-oriented language, from the
ground up. Its class model supports advanced notions such as
polymorphism, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance; yet in
the context of Python's <a naME="idx3"></A>dynamic typing, <A name="idx4"></a>object-oriented
programming (OOP) is remarkably easy to apply. In fact, if you
don't understand these terms, you'll find they are much
easier to learn with Python than with just about any other OOP
language available.</p>



<p>Besides serving as a powerful code structuring and reuse device,
Python's OOP nature makes it ideal as a scripting tool for
object-oriented systems languages such as C++ and Java. For example,
with the appropriate glue code, Python programs can subclass
(specialize) classes implemented in <a name="idx5"></a>C++ or Java. Of equal significance, OOP
is an option in Python; you can go far without having to become an
object guru all at once.</p>






<h5>1.1.1.2
It's free</h5>


<p>Python is <a naMe="idx6"></A>
<a naMe="idx7"></A>freeware—something which has
lately been come to be called <I>open source
software</i>. As with Tcl and Perl, you can get the entire
system for free over the Internet. There are no restrictions on
copying it, embedding it in your systems, or shipping it with your
products. In fact, you can even sell Python, if you're so
inclined.</P>



<P>But don't get the wrong idea: "free" doesn't
mean "unsupported." On the contrary, the Python online
community responds to user queries with a speed that most commercial
software vendors would do well to notice. Moreover, because Python
comes with complete source code, it empowers developers and creates a
large team of implementation experts. Although studying or changing a
programming language's implementation isn't
everyone's idea of fun, it's comforting to know that
it's available as a final resort and ultimate documentation
source.</p>






<H5>1.1.1.3
It's portable</h5>


<P>Python is written in <A NAme="idx8"></a>portable ANSI C, and compiles and runs on
virtually every major platform in use today. For example, it runs on
Unix systems, Linux, MS-DOS, MS-Windows (95, 98, NT), Macintosh,
Amiga, Be-OS, OS/2, VMS, QNX, and more. Further, Python programs are
automatically compiled to portable <i>bytecode</I>,
which runs the same on any platform with a compatible version of
Python installed (more on this in <A href="lpython_snode11.html#7">Section 1.1.1.6</a>).</p>



<P>What that means is that Python programs that use the core language
run the same on Unix, MS-Windows, and any other system with a Python
interpreter. Most Python ports also contain platform-specific
extensions (e.g., COM support on MS-Windows), but the core Python
language and libraries work the same everywhere.</P>



<P>Python also includes a standard interface to the Tk GUI system called
Tkinter, which is portable to the X Window System, MS Windows, and
the Macintosh, and now provides a native look-and-feel on each
platform. By using Python's Tkinter API, Python programs can
implement full-featured graphical user interfaces that run on all
major GUI platforms without program changes.</P>






<h5>1.1.1.4
It's powerful</h5>


<p>From a features perspective, Python is something of a hybrid. Its
tool set places it between traditional scripting languages (such as
Tcl, Scheme, and Perl), and systems languages (such as C, C++, and
Java). Python provides all the simplicity and ease of use of a
scripting language, along with more advanced programming tools
typically found in systems development languages. Unlike some
<a NAME="idx9"></a>scripting languages, this combination
makes Python useful for substantial development projects. Some of the
things we'll find in Python's high-level toolbox:</p>



<a name="idx10"></a><a name="idx11"></a><a name="idx12"></a><Dl>
<Dt>
<foNt COlOR="#990000">
<a NaME="idx10"></A>Dynamic typing</Font></dT>
<DD>
<P>Python keeps track of the kinds of objects your program uses when it
runs; it doesn't require complicated type and size declarations
in your code.</p>
</dd>
<dT>
<I><FOnt coLOR="#990000">Built-in object types</Font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Python provides commonly used data structures such as lists,
dictionaries, and strings, as an intrinsic part of the language; as
we'll see, they're both flexible and easy to use.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><font cOlOr="#990000">Built-in tools</foNt></I></Dt>
<DD>
<p>To process all those object types, Python comes with powerful and
standard operations, including concatenation (joining collections),
slicing (extracting sections), sorting, mapping, and more.</P>
</dD>
<DT>
<I><font COLOr="#990000">Library utilities</fonT></I></DT>
<dd>
<p>For more specific tasks, Python also comes with a large collection of
pre-coded library tools that support everything from
regular-expression matching to networking to object persistence.</p>
</DD>
<DT>
<i><font color="#990000">Third-party utilities</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Because Python is freeware, it encourages developers to contribute
precoded tools that support tasks beyond Python's built-ins;
you'll find free support for COM, imaging, CORBA ORBs,
<A nAme="idx11"></a>XML, and much more.</P>
</dD>
<Dt>
<I><FoNt COLOr="#990000">Automatic memory management</fonT></I></DT>
<dd>
<p>Python automatically allocates and reclaims
("<a NAME="idx12"></a>garbage collects") objects when
no longer used, and most grow and shrink on demand; Python, not you,
keeps track of low-level memory details.</p>
</dd>
<DT>
<I><Font color="#990000">Programming-in-the-large support</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Finally, for building larger systems, Python includes tools such as
modules, classes, and exceptions; they allow you to organize systems
into components, do OOP, and handle events gracefully.</p>
</dD>
</dL>


<p>Despite the array of tools in Python, it retains a remarkably simple
syntax and design. As we'll see, the result is a powerful
programming tool, which retains the usability of a scripting
language.</p>






<h5>1.1.1.5
It's mixable</H5>


<p>Python programs can be easily "glued" to components
written in other languages. In technical terms, by employing the
Python/C <A NaME="idx13"></a>integration APIs, Python programs can be both
<A nAME="idx14"></A>extended by (called to) components written in
C or <a namE="idx15"></A>C++, and
embedded in (called by) C or C++ programs. That means you can add
functionality to the Python system as needed and use Python programs
within other environments or systems.</P>



<P>Although we won't talk much about Python/C integration,
it's a major feature of the language and one reason Python is
usually called a scripting language. By mixing Python with components
written in a compiled language such as C or C++, it becomes an
easy-to-use frontend language and customization tool. It also makes
Python good at rapid prototyping: systems may be implemented in
Python first to leverage its speed of development, and later moved to
C for delivery, one piece at a time, according to performance
requirements.</p>



<p>Speaking of glue, the PythonWin port of Python for MS-Windows
platforms also lets Python programs talk to other components written
for the COM API, allowing Python to be used as a more powerful
alternative to Visual Basic. And a new alternative implementation of
Python, called JPython, lets Python programs communicate with Java
programs, making Python an ideal tool for scripting Java-based web
applications.</p>





<a NAME="7"></a>
<h5>1.1.1.6
It's easy to use</h5>


<p>For many, Python's combination of rapid turnaround and language
simplicity make programming more fun than work. To run a Python
program, you simply type it and run it. There are no intermediate
compile and link steps (as when using languages such as C or C++). As
with other interpreted languages, Python executes programs
immediately, which makes for both an interactive programming
experience and rapid turnaround after program changes.</P>



<P>Strictly speaking, Python programs are compiled (translated) to an
intermediate form called
<I>bytecode</I>
<a name="idx16"></a>,
which is then run by the interpreter. But because the compile step is
automatic and hidden to programmers, Python achieves the development
speed of an interpreter without the performance loss inherent in
purely interpreted languages.</p>



<p>Of course, development cycle turnaround is only one aspect of
Python's ease of use. It also provides a deliberately simple
syntax and powerful high-level built-in tools. Python has been called
"executable pseudocode": because it eliminates much of
the complexity in other tools, you'll find that Python programs
are often a fraction of the size of equivalent programs in languages
such as C, C++, and Java.</p>






<h5>1.1.1.7
It's easy to learn</h5>


<p>This brings us to the topic of this book: compared to other
programming languages, the core Python language is amazingly easy to
learn. In fact, you can expect to be coding significant Python
programs in a matter of days (and perhaps in just hours, if
you're already an experienced programmer). That's good
news both for professional developers seeking to learn the language
to use on the job, as well as for end users of systems that expose a
Python layer for customization or control.<font size="1"><SuP><a hrEf="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></SuP></FoNt>
</P>


<BLOckquOTE><Font sIZE="1">
<P clasS="footnote">
<SUP><a name="FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></sup>
So, you
might ask, how in the world do Python trainers get any business? For
one thing, there are still challenges in Python beyond the core
language that will keep you busy beyond those first few days. As
we'll see, Python's collection of libraries, as well as
its peripheral tools (e.g., the Tkinter GUI and Python/C integration
APIs) are a big part of real Python programming.</p>
</font></blockqUoTe>










<h4>1.1.2
Python on the Job</h4>


<P>Besides being a well-designed programming language, Python is also
useful for accomplishing real-world tasks—the sorts of things
developers do day in and day out. It's commonly used in a
variety of domains, as a tool for scripting other components and
implementing standalone programs. Some of Python's major roles
help define what it is.</p>




<H5>1.1.2.1
System utilities</H5>


<p>Python's built-in interfaces to operating-system services make
it ideal for writing portable, maintainable system-administration
tools (sometimes called shell scripts). Python comes with POSIX
bindings and support for the usual OS tools: environment variables,
files, sockets, pipes, processes, threads, regular expressions, and
so on.</P>






<H5>1.1.2.2
GUIs</h5>


<P>Python's simplicity and rapid turnaround also make it a good
match for <a NAME="idx17"></a>GUI programming. As previously
mentioned, it comes with a standard object-oriented interface to the
Tk GUI API called
<a naME="idx18"></A>Tkinter, which
allows Python programs to implement portable GUIs with native look
and feel. If
<A name="idx19"></A>portability
isn't a priority, you can also use MFC classes to build GUIs
with the PythonWin port for MS Windows, X Window System interfaces on
Unix, Mac toolbox bindings on the Macintosh, and KDE and GNOME
interfaces for Linux. For applications that run in web browsers,
JPython provides another GUI option.</P>






<A Name="idx20"></a><H5>1.1.2.3
Component integration</H5>


<P>Python's ability to be extended by and embedded in C and
<A name="idx20"></a>
<a name="idx21"></a>C++
systems makes it useful as a glue language, for scripting the
behavior of other systems and components. For instance, by
integrating a C library into Python, Python can test and launch its
components. And by embedding Python in a product, it can code on-site
customizations without having to recompile the entire product (or
ship its source code to your customers). Python's COM support
on MS-Windows and the JPython system provide alternative ways to
script applications.</p>






<a name="idx23"></a><h5>1.1.2.4
Rapid prototyping</h5>


<P>To Python programs, components written in Python and C look the same.
Because of this, it's possible to prototype systems in Python
initially and then move components to a compiled language such as C
or C++ for delivery. Unlike some prototyping tools, Python
doesn't require a complete rewrite once the prototype has
solidified; parts of the system that don't require the
efficiency of a language such as C++ can remain coded in Python for
ease of maintenance and use.</p>






<A namE="idx24"></a><H5>1.1.2.5
Internet scripting</H5>


<p>Python comes with standard
<A NaMe="idx22"></A>Internet utility modules that allow
Python programs to communicate over sockets, extract form information
sent to a server-side CGI script, parse
<A NAme="idx23"></a>HTML, transfer files by
FTP, process <a NAME="idx24"></a>XML files,
and much more. There are also a number of peripheral tools for doing
Internet programming in Python. For instance, the HTMLGen and
pythondoc systems generate HTML files from Python class-based
descriptions, and the JPython system mentioned above provides for
seamless Python/Java integration.<fonT SIZe="1"><sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></sup></font>
</p>


<blockquote><FoNt siZe="1">
<P ClASs="footnote">
<SuP><A NAme="FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></sUP>
We say more about
JPython and other systems in <A href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a>. Among
other things, JPython can compile Python programs to Java virtual
machine code (so they may run as client-side applets in any
Java-aware browser) and allows Python programs to talk to Java
libraries (for instance, to create AWT GUIs on a client).</P>
</FONt></bloCKQUote>








<h5>1.1.2.6
Numeric programming</h5>


<p>The <a name="idx25"></a> <a name="idx26"></a>NumPy numeric programming extension
for Python includes such advanced tools as an array object,
interfaces to standard mathematical libraries, and much more. By
integrating Python with numeric routines coded in a compiled language
for speed, NumPy turns Python into a sophisticated yet easy-to-use
numeric programming tool.</p>






<h5>1.1.2.7
Database programming</H5>


<p>Python's standard <A namE="idx27"></a>
<A NaME="idx28"></a>pickle module
provides a simple object-persistence system: it allows programs to
easily save and restore entire Python objects to files. For more
traditional database demands, there are Python interfaces to Sybase,
Oracle, Informix, ODBC, and more. There is even a portable SQL
database API for Python that runs the same on a variety of underlying
database systems, and a system named <I>gadfly</i> that
implements an SQL database for Python programs.</P>






<H5>1.1.2.8
And more: Image processing, AI, distributed objects, etc.</H5>


<P>Python is commonly applied in more domains than can be mentioned
here. But in general, many are just instances of Python's
component integration role in action. By adding Python as a frontend
to libraries of components written in a compiled language such as C,
Python becomes useful for scripting in a variety of domains.</p>



<p>For instance, image processing for Python is implemented as a set of
library components implemented in a compiled language such as C,
along with a Python frontend layer on top used to configure and
launch the compiled components. The easy-to-use Python layer
complements the efficiency of the underlying compiled-language
components. Since the majority of the "programming" in
such a system is done in the Python layer, most users need never deal
with the complexity of the optimized components (and can get by with
the core language covered in this text).</p>








<h4>1.1.3
Python in Commercial Products</H4>


<P>From a more concrete perspective, Python is also being applied in
real revenue-generating products, by real companies. For instance,
here is a partial list of current Python
users:<A Name="idx29"></a></P>



<UL>
<Li><p>	Red Hat uses Python in its Linux install tools.</p>
</lI>
<LI><P>	Microsoft has shipped a product partially written in Python.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Infoseek uses Python as an implementation and end-user customization
language in web search products.</p>
</li>
<li><p>	Yahoo! uses Python in a variety of its Internet services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>	NASA uses Python for mission-control-system implementation.</p>
</lI>
<lI><p>Lawrence Livermore Labs uses Python for a variety of numeric
programming tasks.</p>
</lI>
<lI><P>Industrial Light and Magic and others use Python to produce
commercial-grade animation.</p>
</LI>
</uL>
<p>There are even more exciting applications of Python we'd like
to mention here, but alas, some companies prefer not to make their
use of Python known because they consider it to be a competitive
advantage. See Python's web site (<A TARget="_blank" hREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A>) for a more
comprehensive and up-to-date list of companies using Python.</p>







<h4>1.1.4
Python Versus Similar Tools</h4>


<p>Finally, in terms of what you may already know, people sometimes
compare Python to languages such as <A NAMe="idx30"></a>Perl, Tcl, and Java. While these are
also useful tools to know and use, we think Python:</p>



<uL>
<LI><P>Is more powerful than Tcl, which makes it applicable to larger
systems development</p>
</li>
<li><p>Has a cleaner syntax and simpler design than Perl, which makes it
more readable and maintainable</p>
</li>
<li><p>Doesn't compete head-on with Java; Python is a scripting
language, Java is a systems language such as C++</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially for programs that do more than scan text files, and that
might have to be read in the future by others (or by you!), we think
Python fits the bill better than any other scripting language
available today. Of course, both of your authors are card-carrying
Python evangelists, so take these comments as you may.</p>



<p>And that concludes the hype portion of this book. The best way to
judge a language is to see it in action, so now we turn to a strictly
technical introduction to the language. In the remainder of this
chapter, we explore ways to run Python programs, peek at some useful
configuration and install details, and introduce you to the notion of
module files for making code permanent. Again, our goal here is to
give you just enough information to run the examples and exercises in
the rest of the book; we won't really start programming until
<A href="lpython_cnode17.html">Chapter 2</a>, but make sure you have a handle on the
start-up details shown here before moving on.</P>
