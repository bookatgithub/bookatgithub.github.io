<h3>10.6
Other Frameworks and Applications</h3>


<p>With limited space, we could cover only a few of the most popular
frameworks currently used with Python. There are several others,
which are also deserving of mention and which might very well be what
you need. We briefly describe some here.</p>




<A NAMe="idx975"></a><h4>10.6.1
Python Imaging Library (PIL)</h4>


<P>The <A NAme="idx874"></a>Python Imaging Library is an
extensive framework written by Fredrik<a NAME="idx875"></a> Lundh for creating, manipulating,
converting, and saving bitmapped images in a variety of formats (such
as GIF, JPEG, and PNG). It has interfaces to Tk and Pythonwin, so
that one can use either Tk widgets or Pythonwin code to display
PIL-generated images. Alternatively, the images can be saved to disk
in a variety of formats. The home for PIL is at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pythonware.com/default.htm">http://www.pythonware.com</a>.</p>







<a name="idx978"></a><H4>10.6.2

Numeric Python (NumPy)</h4>


<P>Numeric <a naMe="idx876"></A>Python is a set of extensions
to Python designed to manipulate large arrays of numbers quickly and
elegantly. It was written by Jim Hugunin (JPython's author),
with the support of the subscribers to the Matrix-SIG (more on SIGs
in <A href="lpython_cnode114.html">Appendix A</A>). Since Jim started work on JPython,
the responsibility for Numeric Python has been taken over by folks at
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. NumPy is a remarkably
powerful tool for scientists and engineers, and as such is close to
the heart of one of these authors. More information on it is
available at the main Python web site's topic guide for
scientific computing (<a TARGet="_blank" hrEF="http://www.python.org/topics/scicomp/default.htm">http://www.python.org/topics/scicomp/</A> ).</P>



<p>Here's an example of typical NumPy code,
<i>numpytest</i>.<i>py</I>, and one
representation of the data in generates:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">from Numeric import *              
coords = arange(-6, 6, .02)               # create a range of coordinates
xs = sin(coords)                          # take the sine of all of the x's
ys = cos(coords)*exp(-coords*coords/18.0) # take a complex function of the y's
zx = xs * ys[:,NewAxis]                   # multiply the x row with the y column</PRe>


<p>If you remember your math, you might figure out that
<tt class="monofont">xs</tt> is an array of the sines of the numbers between
-6 and 6, and <tt class="monofont">ys</tt> is an array of the cosines of
those same numbers scaled by an exponential function centered at 0.
<Tt ClasS="monofont">zs</tT> is simply the outer product of those two arrays
of numbers. If you're curious as to what that might look like,
you could convert the array <Tt CLaSs="monofont">z</TT>s into an image (with
the aforementioned PIL, for example) and obtain the image shown in
<A href="lpython_snode110.html#3">Figure 10.7</a>.</P>

<p>NumPy lets you manipulate very large arrays of numbers very
efficiently. The preceding code runs orders of magnitude faster than
comparable code using large lists of numbers and uses a fraction of
the memory. Many Python users never have to deal with these kinds of
issues, but many scientists and engineers require such capabilities
daily.</P>







<H4>10.6.3
SWIG</h4>


<P>Extension modules for Python can be written in C or C++. Such modules
allow easy extension of Python with functions and new types. The
guidelines for writing such extension modules are available as part
of the standard Python library reference and described at some length
in <I>Programming Python</i> as well. One common use of
extension modules is to write interfaces between Python and existing
libraries, which can contain hundreds or thousands of single
functions. When this is the case, the use of automated tools is a
lifesaver. David Beazley's
<A nAME="idx877"></A>
<a namE="idx878"></A>SWIG, the Simple Wrapper Interface
Generator, is the most popular such tool. It's available at
<A TargeT="_blank" HREf="http://www.swig.org/default.htm">http://www.swig.org</a> and is very
well documented. With SWIG, you write simple interface definitions,
which SWIG then uses to generate the C programs that conform to the
Python/C extension guidelines. One very nice feature of SWIG is that
when it's used to wrap C++ class libraries, it automatically
creates so-called <i>shadow classes</i> in Python that
let the user manipulate C++ classes as if they were Python classes.
SWIG can also create extensions for other languages, including Perl
and Tcl.</P>







<A NAme="idx982"></a><a name="idx983"></a><h4>10.6.4


Python MegaWidgets (Pmw)</h4>


<p>Anyone doing serious GUI work with Tkinter should check out Pmw, a
100% Python framework built on top of Tkinter, designed to allow the
creation of megawidgets (compound widgets). Pmw, written by Greg
<a name="idx879"></a>McFarlane,
is the next step beyond Tkinter, and learning it can pay off in the
long run. Pmw's home page is at <a tArGet="_blank" hReF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/default.htm">http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/.</A></p>

ILU and Fnorb</H4>


<P>If the notion of programs talking to programs is of interest to you,
but you want a solution that works on platforms with no COM support,
there are many other packages with similar functionality. Two
favorites are ILU and Fnorb.</P>



<P>ILU stands for Xerox PARC's Inter Language Unification project.
It's free, well-supported, stable, and efficient, and supports
C, C++, Java, Common Lisp, Modula-3, and Perl 5, in addition to
Python. It's available at <a tarGET="_blank" Href="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html.">ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html.</a></P>



<P>
<A Name="idx880"></a>Unlike ILU, Fnorb is written in Python
and supports only Python. It's especially helpful for learning
more about CORBA systems, since it's easy to set up and play
with once you know Python. Fnorb is available from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dstc.edu.au/Fnorb/default.htm">http://www.dstc.edu.au/Fnorb/.</a></p>
