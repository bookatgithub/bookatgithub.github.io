<h3>A.2
Python Software</h3>



<h4>A.2.1
The Standard Python Distribution</h4>


<P>The most essential piece of Python software is clearly the Python
interpreter itself. It's available in many formats for a
variety of platforms. We defer discussion of the platform-specific
issues until <A href="lpython_cnode123.html">Appendix B</a>. In general, the most
reliable way to get an up-to-date distribution is to download it from
the main Python <a NAME="idx885"></a>
<a naME="idx886"></A>
<A name="idx887"></a> <a name="idx888"></a>web site (<a target="_blank" hrEf="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A>). The Python web site
is maintained by volunteers from the <a naMe="idx889"></A>Python Software Association
(see the next sidebar, <A href="lpython_snode117.html#2">The Python Software Association (PSA) and the Python Consortium</A>), a
group dedicated to the long-term success of Python. If you'd
rather get Python binaries on a CD, Walnut Creek has a Python CD-ROM
available that includes binaries for all common platforms (Windows,
Macs, many versions of Unix, BeOS, and VMS). The URL for the last
distribution available at time of writing is <a TARGet="_blank" hrEF="http://www.cdrom.com/titles/prog/python.htm">http://www.cdrom.com/titles/prog/python.htm</A>,
but check the Walnut Creek catalog for eventual newer releases. As
described in <A href="lpython_cnode123.html">Appendix B</A>, most Linux distributions
include Python. Both <I>Programming Python</I> and
<I>Internet Programming with Python</i> (see <a href="lpython_snode118.html#3">Section A.3.3</A>) also come with CDs that
include Python distributions.</P>



<p>The standard distribution comes with hundreds of modules, both in C
and Python. These modules are all officially supported by Guido and
his crew (unless otherwise noted; when replaced by newer tools, old
modules are kept for a few years to give users time to upgrade their
software, and support for them decreases gradually). The interpreter,
the standard library, and the standard documentation constitute the
minimum set of tools a Python user has access to.</p>



<p>In addition to the standard distribution, there are hundreds of
packages and modules available on the Web, most of which are free.
We'll mention a few specifically and where to get them.</p>

The Python Software Association (PSA) and the Python Consortium</h2></ceNTER>


<p><a naME="idx997"></A>While Guido van Rossum <A name="idx890"></a> is Python's primary creator, he has been
getting some help in recent years, especially when it comes to the
various public-relations aspect of the Python language. The Python
Software Association is an association of companies and individuals
who wish to help preserve Python's existence as a free,
evolving, well-supported language. PSA volunteers help run the
<i>python.org</i> web site, organize the Python
conferences, and collect membership dues from PSA members to help
underwrite the costs of the web site, conferences, and other
Python-related events. If you or your company are interested in
joining the PSA, visit the PSA's web site at: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/psa/default.htm">http://www.python.org/psa/</a>.</p>



<P>
<a Name="idx891"></A>One perk of a PSA membership is that it entitles you to a free
account on the <a NAmE="idx892"></A>
<a NaME="idx893"></A>"Starship Python," a web site run by a grateful Python user, Christian Tismer, as a public service to the
Python community. The starship's current URL is <A targET="_blank" HRef="http://../starship.skyport.net/default.htm">http://starship.skyport.net</a>, but it will soon
move to <a TARGet="_blank" hrEF="http://../starship.python.net./default.htm">http://starship.python.net.</A></P>



<p>The Python Consortium is a recent development that holds promise for
long- term support of Python's development. CNRI (Guido van
Rossum's current employer) is proposing to host a consortium of
companies that would support, through membership dues, the
development of the Python and JPython development environments. More
information about the Python Consortium is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/consortium/default.htm">http://www.python.org/consortium/</a>.</p>

<h4>A.2.2
Gifts from Guido</h4>


<P>As if Python and its standard libraries weren't enough, Guido
ships a few other programs as part of the standard distribution. They
are located in the Tools directory of the <a NAmE="idx894"></A>Python source tree (or the Python
installation directory on Windows and Mac).</p>



<P>In this set, as of Python 1.5.2, there is a first cut at an
integrated development environment for<a NAME="idx895"></a> Python,
called <i>idle</i>. As <a href="lpython_snode117.html#4">Figure A.2</a>
shows, it's a GUI based on top of Tkinter, so it requires that
you have Tk/Tcl installed. <i>idle</i> is still in its
infancy, but already provides quite a few nice features that make it
ideal for the Python novice uses to friendly development
environments:</p>



<UL>
<LI><p>A Python shell, smarter than the standard one we've been using
all along.</p>
</li>
<LI><P>A Python-aware editor, which does automatic
"colorization" of Python code: statements are drawn with
one color, comments with another, etc. This is a feature of the
Python mode for Emacs as well, and one that's easy to learn to
love.</P>
</li>
<li><p>A class browser that lets you explore a module's classes and
jump directly to the method definitions in the source code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>	An interactive debugger.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<td valign="top">
<p>We mention a few commercial software companies in this section. While
this might seem at odds with a language that's usually
"free," there is no contradiction in the Python community
to having Python-based projects and "business models."
Python's license is specifically crafted so that software
vendors can use Python with no restrictions. Most Python users are
glad to hear that companies are building successful companies based
on Python. There are quite a few Python-related success stories that
executives more or less freely disclose.<font sIzE="1"><sup><A hREf="#FOOTNOTE-A">[A]</A></SuP></fONT>

the companies that distribute code specifically aimed at Python
programmers, not companies whose products include Python.</P>

Guido van
Rossum is sometimes frustrated to hear companies say, off the record,
that they use Python, but that they don't want it known
publicly because they view their decision to use Python as a
"strategic advantage."</p>

<h5>A.2.3.2
Digital Creation's free releases</h5>


<P>
<a NAmE="idx898"></A>Digital
Creation is a software company that has recently shifted from selling
Python-based software packages to distributing them for free under
the Open Source license. They have made several significant
contributions to the Python community, by contributing to the
standard distribution (they are responsible for the
<tT cLASS="monofont">cPickle</tt>
<a nAME="idx899"></A>
and
<tt clASS="monofont">cStringIO</Tt>
<a naME="idx900"></A>
modules, for example), by helping the Python Software Association
grow in many ways, and by distributing at no cost two very powerful
Python tools. These are:</P>



<a name="idx901"></a><a name="idx902"></a><dl>
<dt>
<font CoLor="#990000">
<a NaME="idx901"></a>ExtensionClass</FOnT></dT>
<DD>
<P>A C extension module that allows the creation of extension types that
can act as Python classes. In addition, ExtensionClasses allow you to
modify the way these new types work, including support for
Acquisition. Acquisition is a mechanism by which objects can get
attributes from the objects that they are a part of, much like
instances can get attributes from their class or from their
class' base classes.</p>
</dd>
<dT>
<I><FOnt coLOR="#990000">Zope</Font></i></DT>
<DD>
<p>A framework for publishing Python object hierarchies on the Web. With
Zope, it's easy to set up a powerful interface to a database of
Python objects. There are several extensions
to<a name="idx902"></a> Zope that allow
scaling of web-based applications, by providing support for
templates, interfaces to database engines, etc. If you're
thinking about developing sophisticated web applications (as opposed
to simple forms processing as we showed in <a href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a>), you should seriously investigate these
tools.</p>
</dd>

<h5>A.2.3.3
Pythonware</h5>


<p>
<a NAME="idx903"></a>Pythonware is a
Swedish Python toolsmith company, with several projects currently in
development, including an Integrated Development Environment for
Python, a lightweight replacement for Tk for Windows platforms, and
an image processing framework. The reason we mention what is still
"vaporware" is that the folks at Pythonware have already
released other tools for free that have shown themselves to be quite
useful, suggesting that these products will be worth the wait. Most
important among their free releases is the Python Imaging Library
(PIL), which we mentioned in <a href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a>, and the
most comprehensive documentation for Tkinter anywhere. For PIL and
other Pythonware tools, look at their web site, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pythonware.com/default.htm">http://www.pythonware.com</a>.</p>

Other Modules and Packages</h4>


<P>There are many other modules and packages available on the Web. These
can be found in many locations:</p>



<ul>
<Li><P>The<A nAMe="idx904"></A> <a NAME="idx905"></a> Contributed Modules section on the main
Python web site (<a taRGET="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/download/Contributed.html">http://www.python.org/download/Contributed.html
</A>) lists hundreds of modules, in a range of topics,
including network tools, and graphic, database, and system
interfaces.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>The <a NAME="idx906"></a>
<a name="idx907"></a>PyModules FAQ is an always evolving list
of modules, also organized by category. It's available at:

<Li><p>The crew of the Starship make many of their tools available. The
Starship project is a web site at which any member of the Python
Software Association can get an account for free, including web
pages. See the previous sidebar for details.</p>
</Li>
</UL>
<p>A few of the tools that can be found in these three directories
deserve special mention, because they have been found remarkably
useful. These are:</P>

Emacs Support</h4>


<P>While this is not truly Python software, there is very good support
for editing Python code from within the Emacs editor (on all
platforms for which Emacs is available). From within Emacs, you can
edit syntax-colored Python code, browse the functions, classes, and
methods within a buffer, and run a Python interpreter or the Pdb
python debugger, all within one of the most popular and powerful
editors available. Information on Python support in Emacs can be
