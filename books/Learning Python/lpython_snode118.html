<h3>A.3
Python Documentation and Books</h3>


<p>There are three kinds of sources of published information on Python:
the standard Python documentation set, published books, and online
material.</p>




<H4>A.3.1
The Standard Python Documentation Set</H4>


<P>The standard
Python<A name="idx915"></A>
documentation set includes five separate documents. They are all
available in various formats (HTML, PDF, and PostScript, among
others) at <A TArget="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/default.htm">http://www.python.org/doc/</a>. They are:</p>



<a name="idx916"></a><a name="idx917"></a><a name="idx918"></a><A nAme="idx919"></a><A nAMe="idx920"></A><A nAmE="idx921"></A><DL>
<dt>
<foNT COlor="#990000"><i>The Tutorial</I>
<A NAme="idx916"></a> </fONT></Dt>
<dd>
<p>A fast-paced introduction to
the<a name="idx917"></a>
language that most current Python programmers used to learn Python.
It assumes a fair bit of previous programming knowledge, so novices
tend to find it overwhelming in places, and it doesn't give
Python's object-oriented features their due.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<font cOlOr="#990000"><i>The Library Reference</i>
<A nAMe="idx918"></A> </FoNt></DT>
<DD>
<p>The most important of the Python books. It lists all the built-in
functions and what the built-in type methods and semantics are, and
describes almost all the modules that make up the standard
distribution. It's well worth keeping on your local hard disk
and consulting when in doubt about a specific function's
interface or semantics, or when you can't remember specific
method names for the built-in objects.</p>
</dd>
<DT>
<FOnt coLOR="#990000"><I>The Language Reference </i>
<a naME="idx919"></A></Font></dt>
<dd>
<p>The most formal specification of the language itself. It gives the
precise definition of syntactic operations, precedence rules, etc.
Most users happily ignore it, but it does give the final word on
intricate details of the language.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<font colOr="#990000"><I>Extending and Embedding</i>
<a nAmE="idx920"></A> </fONt></Dt>
<DD>
<P>A document describing the precise rules of interaction between Python
and C extensions (and the simpler case of embedding, when Python is
being called by an existing C or C++ program). If you wish to write
an extension module for Python, this book defines just what to do.
The section on keeping track of references is especially important
for tracking bugs in such modules.</P>
</dd>
<dt>
<FONT coloR="#990000"><I>The Python/C API</I>
<A name="idx921"></A> </FONt></dt>
<dd>
<p>A document describing the routines Python uses internally. You can
also use these routines to manipulate Python objects from within
C/C++ programs, usually in extension modules.</p>
</dd>
</dl>






<a name="idx1032"></a><a naMe="idx1033"></A><h4>A.3.2
The 
FAQ</h4>


<p>Like many other topics of interest on the Internet, Python has
developed a list of Frequently Asked Questions. It's available
at <A tARgET="_blank" hReF="http://www.python.org/doc/FAQ.html">http://www.python.org/doc/FAQ.html</A>, and
covers everything from general information about Python (its name,
origins, design choices, etc.) to issues arising when compiling or
installing Python, programming questions, and more. The Python FAQ is
maintained by the community at large. Any PSA member can log onto a
web-driven program (a CGI program, like the one we saw in <A href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a>) and update existing entries or add new
entries. As a result, the FAQ is both quite large and very current.</P>

<h4>A.3.3
Other Published Books</H4>


<P>There are three<A Name="idx922"></a> books besides the one you're
holding that are available in bookstores. These are:</P>



<UL>
<Li><p><i> Programming
Python</i>
<a name="idx923"></a>, by Mark Lutz, published by
O'Reilly &amp; Associates. This 860-page book is the logical
next step after <i>Learning Python</i>. It covers in
greater depth all the material covered here, and then some. Almost
all aspects of Python are covered with progressively more
sophisticated examples. <i>Programming Python</i> also
discusses Python/C integration, and advanced applications such as
Tkinter GUIs and persistence.</p>
</li>
<li><p><I>Internet Programming with Python,</i> by Aaron
Watters, Guido van Rossum, and James Ahlstrom, published by M&amp;T
Books. This is a 477-page book that provides an introduction to most
of the Python, with special emphasis on writing programs to publish
web pages.</P>
</li>
<lI><p><I> The Python Pocket
Reference,</I>
<a NAmE="idx924"></a> by Mark Lutz, published by
O'Reilly &amp; Associates. This is a short (75 pages) booklet
listing the core aspect of the syntax, and the most commonly used
modules and their function signatures. It covers Python 1.5.1.</P>
</LI>
</Ul>






<h4>A.3.4
Other Sources of Documentation</h4>


<p>The number of web pages describing Python modules, howto's,
guides for novices, common tasks, etc., makes it impossible to list
them all here. Instead, we'll encourage you to browse the Web,
starting at the main Python web site. The PSA volunteers (Ken
Manheimer, Andrew Kuchling, Barry Warsaw, and Guido van Rossum, to be
precise) spend considerable effort making sure the web site is both
comprehensive and well organized, so you shouldn't have a
problem finding what you need. Most significant packages and modules
have associated web pages and documentation for them.</P>
