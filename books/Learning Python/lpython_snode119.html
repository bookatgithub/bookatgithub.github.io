<h3>A.4
Newsgroups, Discussion Groups, and Email Help</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx925"></a>
<a naME="idx926"></A>Python owes a great deal of its growth to a
worldwide community of users who exchange information about Python
via the Internet. Most day-to-day exchanges about Python occur in
various electronic forums, which each have specific aims and scopes.</P>




<h4>A.4.1
comp.lang.python/python-list</h4>


<p>The main "public space" for discussions of Python is the
<a TARGet="_blank" href="http://../comp.lang.python/default.htm">comp.lang.python</a> Usenet
<a name="idx927"></a>newsgroup, which
is bidirectionally gatewayed as the mailing list
<a href="mailto:python-list@cwi.nl">python-list@cwi.nl</a> (although there are plans to move
it to <a HrEf="mailto:python-list@python.org">python-list@python.org</a>). If you don't have
access to a Usenet newsfeed already, you can read
<i>comp.lang.python</I> using the Dejanews service
(<a TArGEt="_blank" HrEF="http://www.dejanews.com/default.htm">www.dejanews.com</A>), or read the
equivalent <I>python-list</i> mailing list via the
eGroups service (<a taRGET="_blank" href="http://www.egroups.com/list/python-list/default.htm">http://www.egroups.com/list/python-list/</A>). This mailing list/newsgroup is the appropriate forum to
ask questions, discuss specific Python problems, post announcements
of Python jobs, etc.</P>







<H4>A.4.2
comp.lang.python.announce/python-list-announce</H4>


<p>Recently, a new newsgroup was created, with the aim of being a
low-traffic list just for significant announcements of Python-related
news. The <a taRGET="_blank" href="http://../comp.lang.python.announce/default.htm">comp.lang.python.announce</a> newsgroup (also
gatewayed as <a href="mailto:python-list-announce@cwi.nl">python-list-announce@cwi.nl</a> ) is a
moderated forum, so only postings deemed appropriate are allowed
through.</p>







<h4>A.4.3
python-help@python.org</h4>


<p>One of the characteristics of the main Usenet newsgroup/mailing list
is that it's automatically broadcast to tens of thousands of
readers around the world. While this allows for rapid response time
from someone almost always (no matter what time it is, someone is
reading the Python newsgroup somewhere in the world), it also can be
somewhat intimidating, especially to novices. A more private place to
ask questions is the <i>python-help</i> address, which
serves as a helpline. Email to <a hrEf="mailto:python-help@python.org">python-help@python.org</A>
is broadcast to a set of about a dozen volunteers, who will try their
best to promptly answer questions sent to
<i>python-help</i>. When writing to this list, it helps
to specify exactly what configuration you're using (Python
version, operating system, etc.) and to describe your problem or
question precisely. This helps the volunteers understand your
problem, and hopefully help you solve it fast.</p>







<H4>A.4.4
The SIGs</h4>


<P>One more set of mailing lists should be mentioned here. The main
Python newsgroup is remarkable by its generality. However,
periodically, groups of concerned individuals decide to work together
on as specific project, such as the development of a significant
extension or the formalization of a standard interface for a tool or
set of tools. These groups of volunteers are called <I>special
interest groups</i>, or <A NaMe="idx928"></A> <A NAme="idx929"></a>SIGs. These groups have
their own mailing lists, which you should feel free to browse and
join if you feel an affinity with the topic at hand. Successful SIGs
have included the Matrix-SIG, which helped Jim Hugunin develop the
Numeric Python extensions; the String-SIG, which has worked on the
regular expression engine among other topics; and the XML-SIG, which
is developing tools for parsing and processing of XML (eXtensible
Markup Language). An up-to-date listing of the current SIGs (they die
as their task is done, and are born as a need arises) can be found at
<a TARGet="_blank" hrEF="http://www.python.org/sigs/default.htm">http://www.python.org/sigs/</A>. Each
SIG has its own mailing list, archive page, and description.</P>







<h4>A.4.5
JPython-interest</h4>


<p>There is a<a NAME="idx930"></a>
mailing list for discussion of JPython-specific issues. It is worth
reading if you're interested in JPython, as it's a forum
Jim Hugunin and Barry Warsaw use to spread information about JPython
and solicit feedback. Information on the list is available at
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/jpython-interest">http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/jpython-interest</a>.<a name="idx931"></a></p>
