<h3>B.1
Unix</h3>


<p>Python's largest user base is most likely Unix users these
days, although the number of Windows users is growing steadily. There
are several
<a NAME="idx934"></a>
<a naME="idx935"></A>
<A name="idx936"></A>
<A NAme="idx937"></a>distributions
available for Unix. The standard method of obtaining Python is to
download the source distribution (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/download/download_source.html">http://www.python.org/download/download_source.html
</a> ), and configure, build, and install Python yourself.
There was an effort a while back to keep at the Python web site a set
of precompiled binaries of Python for most of the major Unix
platforms, but this effort has mostly been dropped, because there was
no way to make it maintainable; there are too many different versions
of Unix and too many ways to configure Python for each one.</p>



<p>We haven't mentioned configurations of Python in this book;
that's because we've mostly covered the most standard
part of the Python distribution. Someone who downloads the source
distribution, however, will soon notice a references to a file called
<i>Setup</i> in the <i>Modules</I>
directory. This file allows you to configure which modules are
compiled, either for static or for dynamic linking. The set of
available optional modules changes with each release and can be
augmented by downloading third-party extensions.</p>



<p>There is an exception to the "no binary distributions"
rule, and that is for Linux. Most versions of Linux come with Python
already installed, and some use it extensively in their configuration
management system. The version on the Linux distributions may not be
the latest version available. Oliver Andrich maintains a set of RPMs
(which are packages in a standard format for Red Hat Linux) of the
latest distributions of Python, including the most popular
extensions. These are available at <A TarGet="_blank" hREf="http://www.python.org/download/download_linux.html.">http://www.python.org/download/download_linux.html.</a></P>




<H4>B.1.1
Unix-Specific Extensions</H4>


<P>Several<A name="idx938"></A>
extensions are available on most if not all Unix versions. These
include:</P>




<H5>B.1.1.1
Standard distribution</H5>


<p>There are interfaces to most well-established services on Unix. For
example, there is a <tt cLASS="monofont">pwd</tt> module for interacting
with the password file, a <tt CLASs="monofont">grp</tt> module for
manipulating the Unix group database, as well as modules allowing one
to interface to the crypt library functions
(<tt class="monofont">crypt</tt>), the <i>dbm/ndbm/gdbm</i>
database libraries (<tt clasS="monofont">dbm</tt> and
<TT clAss="monofont">gdbm</tT>), the tty I/O control calls
(<Tt cLASS="monofont">termios</Tt>), the file descriptor I/O interface
(<tt cLASS="monofont">fcntl</tt>), a module for measuring and controlling
system resources (<tt CLASs="monofont">resources</tt>), a module for
interfacing with the system logging tools
(<tT CLAss="monofont">syslog</tt>), a wrapper module around the popen call
that makes interfacing with shell commands easier
(<tt class="monofont">commands</tt>), and finally a module that gives access
to the stat system call for finding such things as modification times
of files and the like (<tt class="monofont">stat</Tt>).</p>



<P>The standard library also includes modules that operate on specific
Unix flavors, such as SGI and SunOS/Solaris:</P>






<h5>B.1.1.2
SGI-specific extensions</h5>


<P>On Silicon Graphics systems, the standard distribution includes
modules for interfacing with the AL audio library
(<tt cLAss="monofont">al</TT> and <TT Class="monofont">AL</TT>), the CD library
(<TT clasS="monofont">cd</TT>), the FORMS Library by Mark Overmas
(<Tt claSS="monofont">fl</TT>, <tt class="monofont">flp</tt> and
<tt class="monofont">FL</tt>), the font manager (<tt ClaSS="monofont">fm </tt>),
the old IRIX GL library (<Tt clASs="monofont">gl</tT>, <TT CLass="monofont">GL</tT>
and <TT Class="monofont">DEVICE</TT>),<FOnt siZE="1"><SUp><a href="#FOOTNOTE-A">[A]</a></sup></font>
 and the <tt clasS="monofont">imglib</tt> image
file format (<TT clAss="monofont">imgfile</tT>).</P>


<blOCKQUote><fONT Size="1">
<p CLASs="footnote">
<sup><A NAMe="FOOTNOTE-A">[A]</a></sup>
The OpenGL interface
is supported cross-platform by a set of modules currently maintained
by one of your authors (David Ascher), and is available at
<a target="_blank" href="http://../starship.python.net/~da/PyOpenGL/default.htm">http://starship.python.net/~da/PyOpenGL/</a>. It
currently works on SGI systems as well as other Unix platforms and
Windows, and can be linked with either OpenGL or the compatible Mesa
toolkit.</p>

<H5>B.1.1.3
SunOS-specific extensions</h5>


<p>On SunOS/Solaris, the standard distribution includes one module,
<TT CLAss="monofont">sunaudiodev</tt>, that allows an interface to the audio
device.</P>






<H5>B.1.1.4
Other Unix resources</H5>


<P>Many modules have been published for support of various Unix tools or
have been tested on Unix. These include interfaces to audio
subsystems, scanners, and cameras, the X Window System interface and
its layered toolkits, and many others; search the Python web site if
you're looking for a specific extension you think might have
been interfaced already.</p>
