<h3>1.3
A First Look at Module Files</h3>


<p>Earlier in this chapter, we saw how to run <a NAME="idx50"></a>module files
(i.e., text files containing Python statements) from the
operating-system shell's command line. It turns out that we can
also run module files from Python's interactive command line by
importing or <a naME="idx51"></A>reloading them, as we'd normally
do from other system components. The details of this process are
covered in <A href="lpython_cnode52.html">Chapter 5</A>, but since this turns out to
be a convenient way to save and run examples, we'll give a
quick introduction to the process.</P>



<P>The basic idea behind importing modules is that importers may gain
access to <A name="idx52"></a>names assigned at the top level of a
module file. The names are usually assigned to services exported by
the modules. For instance, suppose we use our favorite text editor to
create the one-line Python module file
<i>myfile.py</i>, shown in the following code snippet.
This may be one of the world's simplest Python modules, but
it's enough to illustrate basic module use:</p>



<pre class="monofont">title = "The Meaning of Life"</pre>


<p>Notice that the filename has a <I>.py</i> suffix: this
naming convention is required for files imported from other
components. Now we can access this module's variable
<Tt clAsS="monofont">title</Tt> in other components two different ways,
either by importing the module as a whole with an
<TT cLaSS="monofont">import</TT> statement and qualifying the module by the
variable name we want to access:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">% <b>python                         </b><i> Start Python</I></PRE>


<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> import myfile                </b><i> Run file, load module as a whole</i></pre>


<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> print myfile.title           </b><i> Use its names: '.' qualification</i></pRe>


<Pre cLaSS="monofont">The Meaning of Life</pRE>


<p>or by fetching (really, copying) names out of a module with
<Tt CLASs="monofont">from</tt> statements:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">% <B>python                         </B><I> Start Python</I></pre>


<pRE CLass="monofont"><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; </b> <b>from myfile import title </b>    <i> Run file, load its names</i></pre>


<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> print title                  </b><I> Use name directly: no need to qualify</i></prE>


<pRE cLAsS="monofont">The Meaning of Life</pRE>


<P>As we'll see later, <Tt claSS="monofont">from</TT> is much like an
<tt clASS="monofont">import</Tt>, with an extra assignment to names in the
importing component. Notice that both statements list the name of the
module file as simply <i>myfile</i>, without its
<i>.py</I> suffix; when Python looks for the actual
file, it knows to include the suffix.</P>



<P>Whether we use <Tt class="monofont">import</tt> or <tt class="monofont">from</tt>,
the statements in the module file <i>myfile.py</i> are
executed, and the importing component (here, the interactive prompt)
gains access to names assigned at the top level of the file.
There's only one such name in this simple example—the
variable <tT cLass="monofont">title</Tt>, assigned to a string—but the
concept will be more useful when we start defining objects such as
functions and classes. Such objects become services accessed by name
from one or more client modules.</P>



<P>When a module file is imported the first time in a session, Python
executes all the code inside it, from the top to the bottom of the
file. Because of this, importing a module interactively is another
way to execute its code all at once (instead of, for instance,
running it from the system shell with a command such as
<tT ClAsS="monofont">python myfile.py</TT>). But there's one catch to
this process: Python executes a module file's code only the
first time it's imported. If you import it again during the
same interactive session, Python won't reexecute the
file's code, even if you've changed it with your editor.
To really rerun a file's code without stopping and restarting
the interactive interpreter, you can use the Python
<Tt claSS="monofont">reload</TT> function, as follows:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">% <b>python                         </b><i> Start Python</I>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> import myfile                </B><I> Run/load module</i>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> print myfile.title           </b><i> Qualify to fetch name</i>
The Meaning of Life

<i> Change myfile.py in your text editor</i>

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import myfile                </b><i> Will NOT rerun the file's code</i>

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>reload(myfile)               </b><i> WILL rerun the file's (current) code</i></pre>


<p>While this scheme works, <tT cLass="monofont">reload</Tt> has a few
complications, and we suggest you avoid it for now (just exit and
reenter the interpreter between file changes). On the other hand,
this has proven to be a popular testing technique in Python classes,
so you be the judge.</P>




<A nAMe="idx56"></A><a NAME="idx57"></a><h4>1.3.1
A First Look at 
Namespace Inspection</h4>


<p>Another trick that has proven popular is using the
<TT CLass="monofont">dir</tT>
<A NAme="idx53"></a> built-in function to keep track of
defined names while programming interactively. We'll have more
to say about it later, but before we turn you loose to work on some
exercises, here is a brief introduction. If you call the
<tT CLAss="monofont">dir</tt>
<a name="idx54"></a> function without arguments, you get
back a Python list (described in <a href="lpython_cnode17.html">Chapter 2</a>)
containing all the names defined in the interactive namespace:</p>



<pre ClAss="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>x = 1</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>y = "shrubbery"</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>dir()</b>
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'x', 'y']</PRe>


<P>Here, the expression <tT CLAss="monofont">dir()</tt> is a <I>function
call</I>; it asks Python to run the
function named <TT clasS="monofont">dir</TT>. We'll meet functions in
<A href="lpython_cnode42.html">Chapter 4</A>; but for now, keep in mind that you need
to add parenthesis after a function name to call it (whether it takes
any arguments or not).</P>



<P>When <Tt class="monofont">dir</tt> is called, some of the names it returns
are names you get "for free": they are built-in names
that are always predefined by Python. For instance, _
_<tt class="monofont">name</tt>__ is the module's filename, and _
_<tt cLaSs="monofont">builtins</tt>__ is a module containing all the
built-in names in Python (including <Tt CLaSS="monofont">dir</tT>). Other
names are variables that you've assigned values to (here,
<tT CLAss="monofont">x</tt> and <TT CLass="monofont">y</tT>). If you call
<TT Class="monofont">dir</TT> with a module as an
<I>argument</I>, you get back the names defined inside
that module:<font size="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a></sup></FoNt>
</p>

<sup><A NAMe="FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a></suP>
Technically, in the module's
<I>namespace</I>—a term we'll soon use so
often that you'll probably get tired of hearing it. Since
we're being technical anyhow, the interactive command line is
really a module too, called __<Tt class="monofont">main</tt>__; code you
enter there works as if it were put in a module file, except that
expression results are printed back to you. Notice that the result of
a <tt class="monofont">dir</tt> call is a list, which could be processed by
a Python program. For now, hold that thought: namespaces can be
fetched in other ways too.</p>
</foNt></BlocKqUOtE>





<PrE cLASS="monofont">% <b>cat threenames.py </b>
a = 'dead'
b = 'parrot'
c = 'sketch'
% <b>python </b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>import threenames </B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>dir(threenames </B>)
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', 'a', 'b', 'c']
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>dir( </b>__<b>builtins </b>__<B>) </B>
<I> All the names Python predefines for you</I></pre>


<p>Later, we'll see that some objects have additional ways of
telling clients which names they expose (e.g., special attributes
such as __<TT CLass="monofont">methods</tt>__ and _
_<tt class="monofont">members</tt>__). But for now, the
<tt clasS="monofont">dir</tT> function lets you do as much poking around as
you'll probably care to do.</p>
