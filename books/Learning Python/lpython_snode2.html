<h3>About This Book</h3>


<p>This book provides a quick introduction to the Python programming
language. Python is a popular object-oriented language used for both
standalone programs and scripting applications in a variety of
domains. It's free, portable, powerful, and remarkably easy to
use. Whether you're new to programming or a professional
developer, this book's goal is to bring you up to speed on the
core Python language in a hurry. Before we jump into details,
we'd like to use this preface to say a few words about the
book's design.</p>




<H4>This Book's Scope</H4>


<P>Although this text covers the essentials of the Python language,
we've kept its scope narrow in the interest of speed and size.
Put another way, the presentation is focused on core concepts and is
sometimes deliberately simplistic. Because of that, this book is
probably best described as both an introduction and a stepping stone
to more advanced and complete texts.</P>



<p>For example, we won't say anything about Python/C
integration—a big, complicated topic, with lots of big,
complicated examples, which is nevertheless central to many
Python-based systems. We also won't talk much about the Python
community, Python's history, or some of the philosophies
underlying Python development. And popular Python applications such
as GUIs, system tools, network scripting, and numeric programming get
only a short survey at the end (if they are mentioned at all).
Naturally, this misses some of the big picture.</p>



<p>By and large, Python is about raising the quality bar a few notches
in the scripting world. Some of its ideas require more context than
can be provided here, and we'd be remiss if we didn't
recommend further study after you finish this text. We hope that most
readers of this book will eventually go on to gain a deeper and more
complete understanding, from texts such as O'Reilly's
<i>Programming Python</I>. The rest of the Python story
requires studying examples that are more realistic than there is
space for here.<FONt sizE="1"><SUP><a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></sup></font>

See <a tARGEt="_blank" hreF="http://www.ora.com/default.htm">http://www.ora.com</A> and <A Target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</a> for details on
supplemental Python texts. <i>Programming Python</i>
was written by one of this book's authors. As its title
implies, it discusses practical programming issues in detail.</p>
</font></bloCkqUOte>





<P>But despite its limited scope (and perhaps because of it), we think
you'll find this to be a great first book on Python.
You'll learn everything you need to get started writing useful
standalone Python programs and scripts. By the time you've
finished this book, you will have learned not only the language
itself, but also how to apply it to day-to-day tasks. And
you'll be equipped to tackle more advanced topics as they come
your way.</p>







<h4>This Book's Style</h4>


<P>Much of this book is based on training materials developed for a
three-day hands-on Python course. You'll find exercises at the
end of most chapters, with solutions in <A href="lpython_cnode130.html">Appendix C</A>.
The exercises are designed to get you coding right away, and are
usually one of the highlights of the course. We strongly recommend
working through the exercises along the way, not only to gain Python
programming experience, but also because some exercises raise issues
not covered elsewhere in the text. The solutions at the end should
help if you get stuck (we encourage you to cheat as much and as often
as you like). Naturally, you'll need to install Python to run
the exercises; more on this in a moment.</P>



<P>Because this text is designed to introduce language basics quickly,
we've organized the presentation by major language features,
not examples. We'll take a bottom-up approach here: from
built-in object types, to statements, to program units, and so on (in
fact, if you've seen Appendix E in <i>Programming
Python</i>, parts of this book may stir up feelings of
déjà vu). Each chapter is fairly self-contained, but
later chapters use ideas introduced in earlier ones (e.g., by the
time we get to classes, we'll assume you know how to write
functions), so a linear reading probably makes the most sense. From a
broader perspective, this book is divided into three sections:</p>




<h5><A href="lpython_cnode7.html">Part I</a></h5>


<p>This part of the book presents the Python language, in a bottom-up
fashion. It's organized with one chapter per major language
feature—types, functions, and so forth—and most of the
examples are small and self-contained (some might also call the
examples in this section artificial, but they illustrate the points
we're out to make). This section represents the bulk of the
text, which tells you something about the focus of the book.</P>



<DL>
<Dt>
<fonT COLor="#990000"><i><a href="lpython_cnode9.html">Chapter 1</a></i></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>We begin with a quick introduction to Python and then look at how to
run Python programs so you can get started coding examples and
exercises immediately.</p>
</Dd>
<dT>
<FonT colOR="#990000"><i><a href="lpython_cnode17.html">Chapter 2</A></i></fonT></DT>
<Dd>
<p>Next, we explore Python's major built-in object types: numbers,
lists, dictionaries, and so on. You can get a lot done in Python with
these tools alone.</p>
</dD>
<DT>
<Font cOLOR="#990000"><i><a href="lpython_cnode31.html">Chapter 3</a></i></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>The next chapter moves on to introduce Python's
statements—the code you type to create and process objects in
Python.</p>
</dd>
<Dt>
<fONt cOlor="#990000"><I><A href="lpython_cnode42.html">Chapter 4</A></I></Font></dT>
<DD>
<P>This chapter begins our look at Python's higher-level program
structure tools. Functions turn out to be a simple way to package
code for reuse.</p>
</dd>
<dT>
<FONt colOR="#990000"><I><A href="lpython_cnode52.html">Chapter 5</a></i></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>Python modules let you organize statements and functions into larger
components, and this chapter illustrates how to create, use, and
reload modules on the fly.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<FonT ColOr="#990000"><i><a href="lpython_cnode63.html">Chapter 6</A></I></FONt></dt>
<dD>
<P>Here we explore Python's object-oriented programming (OOP)
tool, the class. As you'll see, OOP in Python is mostly about
looking up names in linked objects.</P>
</Dd>
<dt>
<fONT Color="#990000"><I><A href="lpython_cnode77.html">Chapter 7</a></i></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>We wrap up the section with a look at Python's exception
handling model and statements. This comes last, because exceptions
can be classes if you want them to be.</p>
</dd>
</dl>





<h5><a href="lpython_cnode87.html">Part II</A></h5>


<p>In this section, we sample Python's built-in tools, and put
them to use in a more or less random collection of small example
programs.</P>



<dl>
<dT>
<FonT COLOr="#990000"><i><a href="lpython_cnode89.html">Chapter 8</A><i>Built-in Tools</i><i></i></I></FONt></dt>
<dD>
<P>This chapter presents a selection of the modules and functions that
are included in the default Python installation. By definition, they
comprise the minimum set of modules you can reasonably expect any
Python user to have access to. Knowing the contents of this standard
toolset will likely save you weeks of work.</P>
</Dd>
<dt>
<font color="#990000"><i><a href="lpython_cnode95.html">Chapter 9</a><i>Common Tasks in Python</I><i></i></I></FonT></dt>
<dD>
<P>This chapter presents a few nontrivial programs. By building on the
language core explained in <a href="lpython_cnode7.html">Part I</A> and the built-in tools described in
<A href="lpython_cnode89.html">Chapter 8</A>, we present many small but useful
programs that show how to put it all together. We cover three areas
that are of interest to most Python users: basic tasks, text
processing, and system interfaces.</P>
</DD>
<dt>
<foNT COlor="#990000"><i><A href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a><i>Frameworks and Applications</i><i></i></i></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>This final chapter shows how real applications can be built,
leveraging on more specialized libraries that are either part of the
standard Python distribution or freely available from third parties.
The programs in this chapter are the most complex, but also the most
satisfying to work through. We close with a brief discussion of
JPython, the Java port of Python, and a substantial JPython program.</p>
</dd>
</dL>





<h5><a href="lpython_cnode112.html">Part III</A></h5>


<p>The book ends with three appendixes that list Python resources on the
Net (<a href="lpython_cnode114.html">Appendix A</A>), give platform-specific tips for using Python on
Unix, Windows, and Macintosh-based machines (<A href="lpython_cnode123.html">Appendix B</a>), and provide
solutions to exercises that appear at the end of chapters (<a href="lpython_cnode130.html">Appendix C</A>). Note: the index can be used to hunt for details, but there are no
reference appendixes in this book per se. The <i>Python Pocket
Reference</i> from O'Reilly (<a tARGEt="_blank" hreF="http://www.ora.com/default.htm">http://www.ora.com</A>), as well as the free
Python reference manuals maintained at <A Target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</a>, will fill in the
details.</p>








<h4>Prerequisites</h4>


<p>There are none to speak of, really. This is an introductory-level
book. It may not be an ideal text for someone who has never touched a
computer before (for instance, we're not going to spend a lot
of time explaining what a computer is), but we haven't made
many assumptions about your programming background or education. On
the other hand, we won't insult readers by assuming they are
"dummies" either (whatever that means); it's easy
to do useful things in Python, and we hope to show you how. The text
occasionally contrasts Python with languages such as C, C++, and
Pascal, but you can safely ignore these comparisons if you
haven't used such languages in the past.</p>



<p>One thing we should probably mention up front: Python's
creator, Guido van Rossum, named it after the BBC comedy
series <i>Monty Python's Flying Circus</i>.
Because of this legacy, many of the examples in this book use
references to that show. For instance, the traditional
"foo" and "bar" become "spam" and
"eggs" in the Python world. You don't need to be
familiar with the series to make sense of the examples (symbols are
symbols), but it can't hurt.</p>
