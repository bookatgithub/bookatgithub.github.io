<h3>2.2
Why Use Built-in Types?</h3>


<p>If<a NAME="idx75"></a> you've used lower-level
languages such as C or C++, you know that much of your work centers
on implementing objects—what some folks call <i>data
structures</i>—to represent the components in your
application's domain. You need to lay out memory structures,
manage memory allocation, implement search and access routines, and
so on. These chores are about as tedious (and error prone) as they
sound, and usually distract from your programs' real goals.</p>



<P>In typical Python programs, most of this grunt work goes away.
Because Python provides powerful object types as an intrinsic part of
the language, there's no need to code object implementations
before you start solving problems. In fact, unless you have a need
for special processing that built-in types don't provide,
you're almost always better off using a built-in object instead
of implementing your own. Here are some reasons why:</P>



<DL>
<dt>
<i><fONT Color="#990000">Built-in objects make simple programs easy to write</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>For simple tasks, built-in types are often all you need to represent
the structure of problem domains. Because we get things such as
collections (lists) and search tables (dictionaries) for free, you
can use them immediately. You can get a lot of work done with just
Python's built-in object types alone.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><FoNt coLoR="#990000">Python provides objects and supports extensions</FoNT></i></Dt>
<DD>
<P>In some ways, Python borrows both from languages that rely on
built-in tools (e.g., LISP), and languages that rely on the
programmer to provide tool implementations or frameworks of their own
(e.g., C++). Although you can implement unique object types in
Python, you don't need to do so just to get started. Moreover,
because Python's built-ins are standard, they're always
the same; frameworks tend to differ from site to site.</P>
</dd>
<dt>
<I><FONt colOR="#990000">Built-in objects are components of extensions</FOnt></i></dT>
<DD>
<P>For more complex tasks you still may need to provide your own
objects, using Python statements and C language interfaces. But as
we'll see in later chapters, objects implemented manually are
often built on top of built-in types such as lists and dictionaries.
For instance, a stack data structure may be implemented as a class
that manages a built-in list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><font color="#990000">Built-in objects are often more efficient than custom data structures</font></i></Dt>
<Dd>
<p>Python's built-in types employ already optimized data structure
algorithms that are implemented in C for speed. Although you can
write similar object types on your own, you'll usually be
hard-pressed to get the level of performance built-in object types
provide.</p>
</Dd>
</DL>


<p>In other words, not only do built-in object types make programming
easier, they're also more powerful and efficient than most of
what can be created from scratch. Regardless of whether you implement
new object types or not, built-in objects form the core of every
Python program.</P>



<P><a href="lpython_snode20.html#1">Table 2.1</A> previews the built-in object types in
this chapter. Some will probably seem familiar if you've used
other languages (e.g., numbers, strings, and files), but others are
more general and powerful than what you may be accustomed to. For
instance, you'll find that lists and dictionaries obviate most
of the work you do to support collections and searching in
lower-level languages.</P>
