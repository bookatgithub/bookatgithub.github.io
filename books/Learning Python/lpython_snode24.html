<h3>2.6
Dictionaries</h3>


<p>Besides lists,
<a NAME="idx197"></a>dictionaries are perhaps the most flexible
built-in data type in Python. If you think of lists as ordered
collections of objects, dictionaries are unordered collections; their
chief distinction is that items are stored and fetched in
dictionaries by key, instead of offset. As we'll see, built-in
dictionaries can replace many of the searching algorithms and
data-structures you might have to implement manually in lower-level
languages. Dictionaries also sometimes do the work of records and
symbol tables used in other languages. In terms of their main
properties, dictionaries are:</p>



<a nAME="idx198"></A><dl>
<dt>
<I><FONt color="#990000">Accessed by key, not offset</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Dictionaries are sometimes called <i>associative
arrays</i> or <i>hashes</i>. They associate a
set of values with keys, so that you can fetch an item out of a
dictionary using the key that stores it. You use the same indexing
operation to get components in a dictionary, but the index takes the
form of a key, not a relative offset.</P>
</dD>
<dt>
<i><FoNT cOLoR="#990000">Unordered collections of arbitrary objects</fONT></I></dt>
<dd>
<P>Unlike lists, items stored in a dictionary aren't kept in any
particular order; in fact, Python randomizes their order in order to
provide quick lookup. Keys provide the symbolic (not physical)
location of items in a dictionary.</P>
</DD>
<dt>
<i><fONT Color="#990000">Variable length, heterogeneous, arbitrarily nestable</FONT></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Like lists, dictionaries can grow and shrink in place (without making
a copy), they can contain objects of any type, and support nesting to
any depth (they can contain lists, other dictionaries, and so on).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<font color="#990000">Of the category mutable <A nAme="idx198"></a>mapping</FoNT></dT>
<Dd>
<P>They can be changed in place by assigning to indexes, but don't
support the sequence operations we've seen work on strings and
lists. In fact, they can't: because dictionaries are unordered
collections, operations that depend on a fixed order (e.g.,
concatenation, slicing) don't make sense. Instead, dictionaries
are the only built-in representative of the mapping type
category—objects that map keys to values.</p>
</DD>
<DT>
<i><fonT COLor="#990000">Tables of object references (hash tables)</foNT></I></Dt>
<dd>
<p>If lists are arrays of object references, dictionaries are unordered
tables of object references. Internally, dictionaries are implemented
as <I>hash tables</I> (data structures that support
very fast retrieval), which start small and grow on demand. Moreover,
Python employs optimized hashing algorithms to find keys, so
retrieval is very fast. But at the bottom, dictionaries store object
references (not copies), just like lists.</P>
</Dd>
</dl>


<p><a href="lpython_snode24.html#1">Table 2.8</a> summarizes some of the most common
dictionary operations (see the library manual for a complete list).
Dictionaries are written as a series of <tt class="monofont">key:value</tt>
pairs, separated by commas, and enclosed in curly braces.<fOnT sizE="1"><sUP><a HReF="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a></SUP></Font>
 An empty dictionary is
an empty set of braces, and
<a NAME="idx199"></a>dictionaries can be
nested by writing one as a value in another dictionary, or an item in
a list (or tuple).</p>


<blOCKQuote><FONT size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a></sUp>
The same note about the relative rarity of constants applies
here: we often build up dictionaries by assigning to new keys at
runtime, rather than writing constants. But see the following section
on changing dictionaries; lists and dictionaries are grown in
different ways. Assignment to new keys works for dictionaries, but
fails for lists (lists are grown with
<Tt clAsS="monofont">append</Tt>).</P>

<p>As <a href="lpython_snode24.html#1">Table 2.8</A> illustrates, dictionaries are indexed
by <i>key</i>; <i></I>in this case, the
key is a string object (<tT ClASs="monofont">'eggs'</Tt>), and nested
dictionary entries are referenced by a series of indexes (keys in
square brackets). When Python creates a dictionary, it stores its
items in any order it chooses; to fetch a value back, supply the key
that stores it.</P>




<H4>2.6.1
Dictionaries in Action</H4>


<P>Let's go back to the interpreter to get a feel for some of the
dictionary operations in <a href="lpython_snode24.html#1">Table 2.8</A>.</P>




<A name="idx227"></A><H5>2.6.1.1
Basic operations</H5>


<P>Generally, you create dictionaries and access items by key. The
built-in <tt clASS="monofont">len</Tt> function works on dictionaries too;
it returns the number of items stored away in the dictionary, or
equivalently, the length of its keys list. Speaking of keys lists,
the dictionary <tt class="monofont">keys</tt> method returns all the keys in
the dictionary, collected in a list. This can be useful for
processing dictionaries sequentially, but you shouldn't depend
on the order of the keys list (remember, dictionaries are
randomized).</p>



<pre class="monofont"><b>% python</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> d2 = {'spam': 2, 'ham': 1, 'eggs': 3}</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> d2['spam']                </b> # fetch value for key
2
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> len(d2)                  </B>  # number of entries in dictionary
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> d2.has_key('ham')       </B>   # key membership test (1 means true)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> d2.keys()                 </b> # list of my keys
['eggs', 'spam', 'ham']</PRe>





<A nAME="idx228"></A><h5>2.6.1.2
Changing dictionaries</h5>


<p>Dictionaries are mutable, so you can change, expand, and shrink them
in place without making new dictionaries, just as for lists. Simply
assign a value to a key to change or create the entry. The
<tT CLAss="monofont">del</tt>
<A NAMe="idx201"></a> statement works here too; it deletes
the entry associated with the key specified as an index. Notice that
we're nesting a list inside a dictionary in this example (the
value of key <tt CLASs="monofont">"ham"</tt>):</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> d2['ham'] = ['grill', 'bake', 'fry']      </b># change entry
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> d2</b>
{'eggs': 3, 'spam': 2, 'ham': ['grill', 'bake', 'fry']}

&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> del d2['eggs']                            </b># delete entry
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> d2</b>
{'spam': 2, 'ham': ['grill', 'bake', 'fry']}

&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> d2['brunch'] = 'Bacon'                    </b># add new entry
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>d2</b>
{'brunch': 'Bacon', 'spam': 2, 'ham': ['grill', 'bake', 'fry']}</prE>


<p>As with lists, assigning to an existing index in a dictionary
<I>changes</I> its associated value. Unlike lists,
whenever you assign a new dictionary key (i.e., one that hasn't
been assigned before), you create a new entry in the dictionary, as
done previously for <tT ClAsS="monofont">'brunch'</TT>. This doesn't
work for lists, because Python considers an offset out of bounds if
it's beyond the end of a list. To expand a list, you need to
use such tools as the
<Tt claSS="monofont">append</TT>
<a namE="idx202"></A> method or slice assignment instead.</P>






<H5>2.6.1.3
A marginally more real example</h5>


<p>Here is a more realistic dictionary example. The following example
creates a table that maps programming language names (the keys) to
their creators (the values). You fetch a creator name by indexing on
language name:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> table = {'Python':  'Guido van Rossum',</b>
... <b>         'Perl':    'Larry Wall',</b>
...<b>          'Tcl':     'John Ousterhout' }</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> language = 'Python'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> creator  = table[language]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> creator</b>
'Guido van Rossum'
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> for lang in table.keys(): print lang, '\t', table[lang]</b>
...
Tcl     John Ousterhout
Python  Guido van Rossum
Perl    Larry Wall</pre>


<P>Notice the last command. Because dictionaries aren't sequences,
you can't iterate over them directly with a
<tT claSs="monofont">for</TT> statement, as for strings and lists. But if
you need to step through the items in a dictionary it's easy:
calling the dictionary <tT ClAsS="monofont">keys</TT> method returns a list
of all stored keys you can iterate through with a
<Tt claSS="monofont">for</TT>. If needed, you can index from key to value
inside the <tt clASS="monofont">for</Tt> loop as done previously.
We'll talk about the <tt cLASS="monofont">print</tt> and
<tt class="monofont">for</tt> statements in more detail in <a href="lpython_cnode31.html">Chapter 3</a>.</p>








<h4>2.6.2
Dictionary Usage Notes</h4>


<P>Before we
move<a Name="idx203"></A> on to more types, here are a few
additional details you should be aware of when using dictionaries:</p>



<A NaME="idx204"></a><A nAME="idx205"></A><a namE="idx206"></A><DL>
<dt>
<i><fONT Color="#990000">Sequence operations don't work</FONT></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>We're being redundant on purpose here, because this is another
common question from new users. Dictionaries are mappings, not
sequences; because there's no notion of ordering among their
items, things like concatenation (an ordered joining) and slicing
(extracting contiguous section) simply don't apply. In fact,
Python raises an error when your code runs, if you try.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<font color="#990000">Assigning to new<A nAme="idx204"></a>
<A nAMe="idx205"></A> indexes adds entries</FoNt></DT>
<DD>
<p>Keys can be created either when you write a dictionary constant (in
which case they are embedded in the constant itself), or when you
assign values to new keys of an existing dictionary object. The end
result is the same.</p>
</dd>
<DT>
<I><Font cOLOR="#990000">Keys need not always be strings</font></I></DT>
<Dd>
<p>We've been using strings as
<a name="idx206"></a>keys
here, but other immutable objects (not lists) work just as well. In
fact, you could use integers as keys, which makes a dictionary look
much like a list (albeit, without the ordering). Tuples (up next) are
sometimes used as dictionary keys too, allowing for compound key
values. And class instance objects (discussed in <a href="lpython_cnode63.html">Chapter 6</a>) can be used as keys, as long as they have the
proper protocol methods; they need to tell Python that their values
won't change, or else they would be useless as fixed keys.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<p><TaBle cElLSpACiNg="0" WIDTh="90%" borDER="1"><Tr><td>
<cENTEr><h2>
Why You Will Care: Dictionary Interfaces</h2></cENTEr>


<p>Besides being a convenient way to store information by key in your
programs, some Python extensions also present <a name="idx207"></a>interfaces that look
and work the same as dictionaries. For instance, Python's
interface to <i>dbm</i>
<a name="idx208"></a> access-by-key files looks much
like a dictionary that must be opened; strings are stored and fetched
using key indexes:</p>


<pre ClAss="monofont">import anydbm
file = anydbm.open("filename")      # link to external file
file['key'] = 'data'                # store data by key
data = file['key']                  # fetch data by key</pRe>

<P>Later, we'll see that we can store entire Python objects this
way too, if we replace "anydbm" in the above with
"shelve" (shelves are access-by-key databases of
persistent Python objects). For Internet work, Python's CGI
script support also presents a dictionary-like interface; a call to
<I>cgi.FieldStorage</i> yields a dictionary-like
object, with one entry per input field on the client's web
page:</P>


<PrE cLASS="monofont">import cgi
form = cgi.FieldStorage()       # parse form data (stdin, environ)
if form.has_key('name'):
    showReply('Hello, ' + form['name'].value)</pre>

<p>All of these (and dictionaries) are instances of mappings. More on
CGI scripts in <A href="lpython_cnode95.html">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
