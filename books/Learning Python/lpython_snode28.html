<h3>2.10
Built-in Type Gotchas</h3>


<p>In this and most of the next few chapters, we'll include a
discussion of common problems that seem to bite new users (and the
occasional expert), along with their solutions. We call
these<a NAME="idx238"></a> <a naME="idx239"></A> <I>gotchas—</i>a
degenerate form of "got you"—because some may catch
you by surprise, especially when you're just getting started
with Python. Others represent esoteric Python behavior, which comes
up rarely (if ever!) in real programming, but tends to get an
inordinate amount of attention from language aficionados on the
Internet (like us).<fonT SIZe="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-12">[12]</a></sup></font>
 Either way, all have something to teach us
about Python; if you can understand the exceptions, the rest is easy.</p>


<blOcKquoTe><FOnT SiZe="1">
<P CLAss="footnote">
<suP><A NAme="FOOTNOTE-12">[12]</a></sUP>
We should also note that Guido
could make some of the gotchas we describe go away in future Python
releases, but most reflect fundamental properties of the language
that are unlikely to change (but don't quote us on
that).</P>

<h4>2.10.1
Assignment Creates References, Not Copies</h4>


<p>We've talked<a name="idx240"></a> about this
<i></i>
<a namE="idx241"></a>
<A namE="idx242"></a> <A NaME="idx243"></a>earlier, but we want to mention it
again here, to underscore that it can be a gotcha if you don't
understand what's going on with shared references in your
program. For instance, in the following, the list object assigned to
name <Tt CLASs="monofont">L</tt> is referenced both from
<tT CLAss="monofont">L</tt> and from inside the list assigned to name
<TT CLass="monofont">M</tT>. Changing <TT Class="monofont">L</tt> in place changes
what <tt class="monofont">M</tt> references too:</p>



<pre cLaSs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> L = [1, 2, 3]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> M = ['X', L, 'Y']       </b># embed a reference to L
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> M</B>
['X', [1, 2, 3], 'Y']

&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> L[1] = 0                </B># changes M too
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> M</b>
['X', [1, 0, 3], 'Y']</PrE>



<H5>2.10.1.1
Solutions</H5>


<P>This effect usually becomes important only in larger programs, and
sometimes shared references are exactly what you want. If
they're not, you can avoid sharing objects by copying them
explicitly; for lists, you can always make a top-level copy by using
an empty-limits slice:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>L = [1, 2, 3]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>M = ['X', L[:], 'Y']       </B># embed a copy of L
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>L[1] = 0                   </B># only changes L, not M 
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>L</b>
[1, 0, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>M</b>
['X', [1, 2, 3], 'Y']</pRE>


<P>Remember, slice limits default to
and the length of the sequence being sliced; if both are omitted, the
slice extracts every item in the sequence, and so makes a top-level
copy (a new, unshared object).<Font size="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-13">[13]</a></sup></fOnT>
</p>


<blOcKQuOTe><FoNT SIze="1">
<p cLASS="footnote">
<sup><a NAME="FOOTNOTE-13">[13]</a></sup>
Empty-limit slices
still only make a top-level copy; if you need a complete copy of a
deeply nested data structure, you can also use the standard
<TT CLass="monofont">copy</tt> module that traverses objects recursively.
See the library manual for details.</p>

<H4>2.10.2
Repetition Adds One-Level Deep</h4>


<P>When we introduced sequence<a naMe="idx244"></A> repetition, we said it's like adding
a sequence to itself a number of times. That's true, but when
mutable sequences are nested, the effect might not always be what you
expect. For instance, in the following, <Tt CLaSs="monofont">X</TT> is
assigned to <TT clasS="monofont">L</TT> repeated <Tt claSS="monofont">four</TT>
times, whereas <tt clASS="monofont">Y</Tt> is assigned to a list
<i>containing</i> <tt class="monofont">L</tt> repeated
<tt class="monofont">four</tT> times:</p>



<Pre cLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> L = [4, 5, 6]</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> X = L * 4           </b># like [4, 5, 6] + [4, 5, 6] + ...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> Y = [L] * 4         </b># [L] + [L] + ... = [L, L,...]

&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> X</B>
[4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> Y</B>
[[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]</pre>


<p>Because <TT CLass="monofont">L</tT> was nested in the second repetition,
<TT Class="monofont">Y</TT> winds up embedding references back to the
<I>original</I> list assigned to <tt class="monofont">L</tt>,
and is open to the same sorts of side effects we noted in the last
section:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> L[1] = 0            </b># impacts Y but not X
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> X</b>
[4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> Y</b>
[[4, 0, 6], [4, 0, 6], [4, 0, 6], [4, 0, 6]]</prE>



<h5>2.10.2.1
Solutions</H5>


<P>This is really another way to trigger the shared mutable object
reference issue, so the same solutions above apply here. And if you
remember that repetition, concatenation, and slicing copy only the
top level of their operand objects, these sorts of cases make much
more sense.</p>








<H4>2.10.3
Cyclic Data Structures Can't Be Printed</H4>


<p>We actually encountered this gotcha in a prior exercise: if a
compound object contains a reference to itself, it's called
a<A nAME="idx245"></A>
<i>cyclic</i> object. In Python versions before Release
1.5.1, printing such objects failed, because the Python printer
wasn't smart enough to notice the cycle (you'll keep
seeing the same text printed over and over, until you break
execution). This case is now detected, but it's worth knowing;
cyclic structures may also cause code of your own to fall into
unexpected loops if you're not careful. See the solutions to
<a href="lpython_cnode9.html">Chapter 1</A> exercises for more details.</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> L = ['hi.']; L.append(L)  </b> # append reference to same object
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> L                          </B># before 1.5.1: a loop! (cntl-C breaks)</PRE>



<h5>2.10.3.1
Solutions</h5>


<p>Don't do that. There are good reasons to create cycles, but
unless you have code that knows how to handle them, you probably
won't want to make your objects reference themselves very often
in practice (except as a parlor trick).</p>








<h4>2.10.4
Immutable Types Can't Be Changed in Place</h4>


<p>Finally, as we've mentioned plenty of times by now: you
can't change an <a name="idx246"></a>
<a name="idx247"></a>immutable object
in place:</p>



<PrE claSs="monofont">T = (1, 2, 3)
T[2] = 4             # error!
T = T[:2] + (4,)     # okay: (1, 2, 4)</PRe>



<H5>2.10.4.1
Solutions</H5>


<p>Construct a new object with slicing, concatenation, and so on, and
assign it back to the original reference if needed. That might seem
like extra coding work, but the upside is that the previous gotchas
can't happen when using immutable objects such as tuples and
strings; because they can't be changed in place, they are not
open to the sorts of side effects that lists are.</P>
