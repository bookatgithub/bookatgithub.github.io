<h3>4.1
Why Use Functions?</h3>


<p>Before we get into the details, let's get a clear picture of
what functions are about. Functions are a nearly universal
program-structuring device. Most of you have probably come across
them before in other languages, but as a brief introduction,
functions serve two primary development roles:</p>

<dd>
<p>As in most <a namE="idx346"></a>programming languages, Python functions
are the simplest way to package
logic<A namE="idx347"></a>
you may wish to use in more than one place and more than one time. Up
to now, all the code we've been writing runs immediately;
functions allow us to group and parametize chunks of code to be used
arbitrarily many times later.</P>

<dd>
<P>Functions also provide a tool for splitting systems into pieces that
have a well-defined role. For instance, to make a pizza from scratch,
you would start by mixing the dough, rolling it out, adding toppings,
baking, and so on. If you were programming a pizza-making robot,
functions would help you divide the overall "make pizza"
task into chunks—one function for each subtask in the process.
It's easier to implement the smaller tasks in isolation than it
is to implement the entire process at once. In general, functions are
about procedure—how to do something, rather than what
you're doing it to. We'll see why this distinction
matters in <A href="lpython_cnode63.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
</DD>
</DL>


<p>Here, we talk about function basics, scope rules and argument
passing, and a handful of related concepts. As we'll see,
functions don't imply much new syntax, but they do lead us to
some bigger programming ideas.</p>
