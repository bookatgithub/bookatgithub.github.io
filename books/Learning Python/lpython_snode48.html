<h3>4.5
Odds and Ends</h3>


<p>So far, we've seen what it takes to write our own functions in
Python. There are a handful of additional function-related ideas
we'd like to introduce in this section:</p>



<UL>
<LI><p><tt cLASS="monofont">lambda</tt> creates anonymous functions.</p>
</lI>
<LI><P><tt class="monofont">apply</tt> calls functions with argument tuples.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt claSs="monofont">map</Tt> runs a function over a sequence and collects
results.</p>
</lI>
<lI><P>Functions return <tT ClAsS="monofont">None</TT> if they don't use a
<Tt claSS="monofont">return</TT> statement.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>	Functions present design choices.</P>
</Li>
<li><p>	Functions are objects, just like numbers and strings.</P>
</LI>
</Ul>

<h4>4.5.1
lambda Expressions</h4>


<p>Besides the <tt class="monofont">def</tt> statement, Python also provides an
expression form that generates function objects. Because of its
similarity to a tool in the LISP language, it's called
<tt class="monofont">lambda</Tt>. Its general form is the keyword
<Tt clAsS="monofont">lambda</Tt>, followed by one or more arguments,
followed by an expression after a colon:</P>



<PrE cLASS="monofont"><a namE="idx384"></A>
<A Name="idx385"></a>lambda argument1, argument2,... argumentN : <PRE><I>Expression using arguments</i></pre></PRE>


<P>Function objects returned by <tt class="monofont">lambda</tt> expressions
are exactly the same as those created and assigned by
<tt class="monofont">def</tt>. But the <tt ClAss="monofont">lambda</tT> has a few
differences that make it useful in specialized roles:</p>



<DL>
<dT>
<I><fOnT COLor="#990000">lambda is an expression, not a statement</foNT></I></Dt>
<dd>
<p>Because of this, a <TT CLass="monofont">lambda</tT> can appear in places a
<TT Class="monofont">def</tt> can't—inside a list constant, for
example. As an expression, the <tt class="monofont">lambda</tt> returns a
value (a new function), which can be assigned a name optionally; the
<tt claSs="monofont">def</Tt> statement always assigns the new function to
the name in the header, instead of returning it as a result.</p>
</dD>
<dT>
<I><fONt CoLOR="#990000">lambda bodies are a single expression, not a block of statements</Font></i></DT>
<DD>
<p>The <tt cLASS="monofont">lambda</tt>'s body is similar to what
you'd put in a <tt CLASs="monofont">def</tt> body's
<tt class="monofont">return</tt> statement; simply type the result as a
naked expression, instead of explicitly returning it. Because
it's limited to an expression, <tt class="monofont">lambda</tT> is
less general than a <tT claSs="monofont">def</TT>; you can only squeeze so
much logic into a <tT ClAsS="monofont">lambda</TT> body without using
statements such as <Tt claSS="monofont">if</TT>.</p>
</dd>
</dL>


<P>Apart from those distinctions, the <TT clasS="monofont">def</TT> and
<Tt class="monofont">lambda</tt> do the same sort of work. For instance,
we've seen how to make functions with <tt class="monofont">def</tt>
statements:</p>



<prE cLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> def func(x, y, z): return x + y + z</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> func(2, 3, 4)</B>
9</pRE>


<p>But you can achieve the same effect with a <Tt CLASs="monofont">lambda</tt>
expression, by explicitly assigning its result to a name:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> f = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> f(2, 3, 4)</B>
9</pre>


<p>Here, <TT CLass="monofont">f</tt> is assigned the function object the
<tt class="monofont">lambda</tt> expression creates (this is how
<tt clasS="monofont">def</tT> works, but the assignment is automatic).
Defaults work on <tt cLaSS="monofont">lambda</tT> arguments too, just like
the <Tt ClASS="monofont">def</Tt>:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>x = (lambda a="fee", b="fie", c="foe": a + b + c)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>x("wee")</B>
'weefiefoe'</PRe>


<p><tt CLASs="monofont">lambda</tt>s come in handy as a shorthand for
functions. For instance, we'll see later that callback handlers
are frequently coded as <tt class="monofont">lambda</tt> expressions
embedded directly in a registration call, instead of being defined
elsewhere in a file and referenced by name.</p>



<p><table cElLspaCiNG="0" wIDtH="90%" bORDEr="1"><tr><tD>

<CENter><h2>
Why You Will Care: lambdas</H2></CENter>


<p>The <TT CLass="monofont">lambda</tt>
<a name="idx386"></a> expression is most handy as a shorthand
for <tt class="monofont">def</tt>, when you need to stuff small pieces of
executable code in places where statements are illegal syntactically.
For example, you can build up a list of functions by embedding
<Tt ClasS="monofont">lambda</tT> expressions in a list constant:</P>


<pRE cLaSS="monofont">L = [lambda x: x**2, lambda x: x**3, lambda x: x**4]

for f in L:
    print f(2)     # prints 4, 8, 16

print L[0](3)      # prints 9</PRe>

<p>Without <tt CLASs="monofont">lambda</tt>, you'd need to instead code
three <tT CLAss="monofont">def</tt> statements outside the list in which the
functions that they define are to be used. <TT CLass="monofont">lambda</tt>s
also come in handy in function argument lists; one very common
application of this is to define in-line callback functions for the
Tkinter GUI API (more on Tkinter in <a href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a>).
The following creates a button that prints a message on the console
when pressed:</p>


<pre class="monofont">import sys
widget = Button(text    ="Press me", 
                command = lambda: sys.stdout.write("Hello world\n"))</PrE>

</td></tR></tABlE></P>







<h4>4.5.2
The apply Built-in</H4>


<p>Some programs need to call arbitrary functions in a generic fashion,
without knowing their names or arguments ahead of time. We'll
see examples of where this can be useful later, but by way of
introduction, the <TT CLass="monofont">apply</tT>
<A NAme="idx387"></a>
<a NAME="idx388"></a> built-in function does the job. For
instance, after running the code in the prior section, you can call
the generated functions by passing them as arguments to
<tt cLASS="monofont">apply</tt>, along with a tuple of arguments:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> apply(func, (2, 3, 4))</b>
9
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> apply(f, (2, 3, 4))</b>
9</pre>


<p><tT cLass="monofont">apply</Tt> simply calls the passed-in function,
matching the passed-in arguments list with the function's
expected arguments. Since the arguments list is passed in as a tuple
(a data structure), it can be computed at runtime by a program. The
real power of <TT cLAsS="monofont">apply</tT> is that it doesn't need
to know how many arguments a function is being called with; for
example, you can use <TT Class="monofont">if</TT> logic to select from a set
of functions and argument lists, and use <TT clasS="monofont">apply</TT> to
call any:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">if &lt;<tt class="monofont"><i>test</i></tt>&gt;:
    action, args = func1, (1,)
else:
    action, args = func2, (1, 2, 3)
. . . 
apply(action, args)</pre>






<a name="idx432"></a><A nAme="idx433"></a><H4>4.5.3
The
 map Built-in</h4>


<P>One of the more common things programs do with lists is to apply an
operation to each node and collect the results. For instance,
updating all the counters in a list can be done easily with a
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">for</TT> loop:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>counters = [1, 2, 3, 4]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>updated = []</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>for x in counters:</B>
...     <B>updated.append(x + 10)              </B># add 10 to each item
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>updated</b>
[11, 12, 13, 14]</pre>


<P>Because this is such a common operation, Python provides a built-in
that does most of the work for you: the
<TT Class="monofont">map</tt>
<a name="idx389"></a>
function applies a passed-in function to each item in a sequence
object and returns a list containing all the function call results.
For example:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def inc(x): return x + 10            </B>   # function to be run
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>map(inc, counters)                   </b>   # collect results
[11, 12, 13, 14]</pRe>


<P>Since <Tt CLaSs="monofont">map</TT> expects a function, it also happens to
be one of the places where <TT clasS="monofont">lambda</TT>s commonly
appear:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>map((lambda x: x + 3), counters)       </b> # function expression
[4, 5, 6, 7]</prE>


<P><TT class="monofont">map</tt> is the simplest representative of a class of
Python built-ins used for <i>functional programming</i>
(which mostly just means tools that apply functions to sequences).
Its relatives filter out items based on a test
(<tt class="monofont">filter</tt>) and apply operations to pairs of items
(<tt ClAss="monofont">reduce</tT>). We say more about these built-in tools
in <a href="lpython_cnode89.html">Chapter 8</A>.</p>







<H4>4.5.4
Python "Procedures"</h4>


<P>In Python<A NAme="idx390"></a> <a NAME="idx391"></a> functions,
<tt cLASS="monofont">return</tt> statements are optional. When a function
doesn't return a value explicitly, the function exits when
control falls off the end. Technically, all functions return a value;
if you don't provide a <tt CLASs="monofont">return</tt>, your function
returns the <tt class="monofont">None</tt>
<a name="idx392"></a> object automatically:</p>



<pRe ClasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> def proc(x):</B>
... <B>    print x       </b> # no return is a None return
<B>...</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> x = proc('testing 123...')</B>
testing 123...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> print x</B>
None</PRE>


<p>Functions such as this without a <tt cLASS="monofont">return</tt> are
Python's equivalent of what are called
<i>procedures</i> in some languages (such as Pascal).
They're usually called as a statement (and the
<TT CLass="monofont">None</tT> result is ignored), since they do their
business without computing a useful result. This is worth knowing,
because Python won't tell you if you try to use the result of a
function that doesn't return one. For instance, assigning the
result of a list <TT Class="monofont">append</tt> method won't raise
an error, but you'll really get back <tt class="monofont">None</tt>,
not the modified list:</p>



<pre cLaSs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>list = [1, 2, 3]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>list = list.append(4)    </b>  # append is a 'procedure'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>print list         </B>        # append changes list in-place<b> </B>
None</PrE>






<h4>4.5.5
Function Design Concepts</H4>


<P>When you start using
<A Name="idx393"></a>functions, you're faced with
choices about how to glue components together—for instance, how
to decompose a task into functions, how functions should communicate,
and so on. Some of this falls into the category of structured
analysis and design, which is too broad a topic to discuss in this
book. But here are a few general hints for Python beginners:</P>



<DL>
<Dt>
<i><foNT COlor="#990000">Use arguments for inputs and return for outputs</fONT></I></dt>
<dd>
<p>Generally speaking, you should strive to make a function independent
of things outside of it. Arguments and <tt class="monofont">return</tt>
statements are often the best way to isolate dependencies.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><FoNt coLoR="#990000">Use global variables only when absolutely necessary</FoNT></i></Dt>
<DD>
<P>Global variables (i.e., names in the enclosing module) are usually a
poor way to communicate with a function. They can create dependencies
that make programs difficult to change.</P>
</dd>
<dt>
<I><FONt colOR="#990000">Don't change mutable arguments unless the caller expects it</FOnt></i></dT>
<DD>
<P>Functions can also change parts of mutable objects passed in. But as
with global variables, this implies lots of coupling between the
caller and callee, which can make a function too specific and
brittle.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<p><a href="lpython_snode48.html#6">Table 4.3</a> summarizes the ways functions can talk
to the outside world; inputs may come from items in the left column,
and results may be sent out in any of the forms on the right.
Politically correct function designers usually only use arguments for
inputs and <tt class="monofont">return</tT> statements for outputs. But
there are plenty of exceptions, including Python's OOP
support—as we'll see in <a href="lpython_cnode63.html">Chapter 6</A>,
Python classes depend on changing a passed-in mutable object. Class
functions set attributes of an automatically passed-in
<tT ClASs="monofont">self</Tt> object, to change per-object state
information (e.g., <TT CLass="monofont">self.name</tT> <TT Class="monofont">=</TT>
<TT clasS="monofont">'bob'</TT>); side effects aren't dangerous if
they're expected.</P>

<H4>4.5.6
Functions Are Objects: Indirect Calls</h4>


<p>Because
Python<a nAME="idx394"></A> functions are objects at runtime, you
can write programs that process them generically. Function objects
can be assigned, passed to other functions, stored in data
structures, and so on, as if they were simple numbers or strings.
Function objects happen to export a special operation; they can be
called by listing arguments in parentheses after a function
expression. But functions belong to the same general category as
other objects.</p>



<p>For instance, as we've seen, there's really nothing
special about the name we use in a <tt class="monofont">def</tt> statement:
it's just a variable assigned in the current scope, as if it
had appeared on the left of an <tt class="monofont">=</tt> sign. After a
<Tt ClasS="monofont">def</tT> runs, the function name is a reference to an
object; you can <I>reassign</i> that object to other
names and call it through any reference—not just the original
name:</P>



<PrE cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def echo(message):        </b>   # echo assigned to a function object
...     <b>print message</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>x = echo                </B>     # now x references it too
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>x('Hello world!')           </B> # call the object by adding ()
Hello world!</pre>


<p>Since arguments are passed by assigning objects, it's just as
easy to pass functions to other functions, as arguments; the callee
may then call the passed-in function just by adding arguments in
parentheses:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>def indirect(func, arg):</B>
...     <B>func(arg)                         </b># call object by adding ()
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>indirect(echo, 'Hello jello!')        </b># pass function to a function
Hello jello!</pre>


<p>You can even stuff function objects into data structures, as though
they were integers or strings. Since Python compound types can
contain any sort of object, there's no special case here
either:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>schedule = [ (echo, 'Spam!'), (echo, 'Ham!') ]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>for (func, arg) in schedule:</b>
...     <B>apply(func, (arg,))</b>
...
Spam!
Ham!</Pre>


<p>This code simply steps through the <Tt CLaSS="monofont">schedule</tT> list,
calling the <tT CLAss="monofont">echo</tt> function with one argument each
time through. As we hope you're starting to notice by now,
Python's lack of type declarations makes for an incredibly
flexible programming language. Notice the use of
<TT CLass="monofont">apply</tT> to run functions generically, the
single-item tuple in the second argument to <TT Class="monofont">apply</TT>,
and the tuple unpacking assignment in the <TT class="monofont">for</tt> loop
header (all ideas introduced earlier).</p>
