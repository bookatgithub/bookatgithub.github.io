<h3>4.6
Function Gotchas</h3>


<p>Here are some of the more
<a NAME="idx395"></a>jagged edges of
<a naME="idx396"></A>functions
you might not expect. They're all obscure, but most have been
known to trip up a new user.</P>




<h4>4.6.1
Local Names Are Detected Statically</h4>


<p>As we've seen, <a NAME="idx397"></a>Python
classifies names assigned in a <a name="idx398"></a>function as locals by default; they
live in the function's scope and exist only while the function
is running. What we didn't tell you is that Python detects
locals statically, when it compiles the code, rather than by noticing
assignments as they happen at runtime. Usually, we don't care,
but this leads to one of the most common oddities posted on the
Python newsgroup by beginners.</p>



<p>Normally, a name that isn't assigned in a function is looked up
in the enclosing module:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> X = 99</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> def selector():      </b>  # X used but not assigned
... <B>    print X            </b># X found in global scope
<b>...</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> selector()</b>
99</PRe>


<P>Here, the <Tt ClASS="monofont">X</Tt> in the function resolves to the
<tt cLASS="monofont">X</tt> in the module outside. But watch what happens if
you add an assignment to <tt CLASs="monofont">X</tt> after the reference:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> def selector():</b>
... <b>    print X             </b> # does not yet exist!
... <b>    X = 88              </b> # X classified as a local name (everywhere)
... <b>                        </b> # can also happen if "import X", "def X",...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> selector()</b>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in selector
NameError: X</pre>


<p>You get an undefined name error, but the reason is subtle. Python
reads and compiles this code when it's typed interactively or
imported from a module. While compiling, Python sees the assignment
to <tt ClAss="monofont">X</tT> and decides that <tT ClASs="monofont">X</Tt> will be
a local name everywhere in the function. But later, when the function
is actually run, the assignment hasn't yet happened when the
<TT CLass="monofont">print</tT> executes, so Python says you're using
an undefined name. According to its name rules, it should; local
<TT Class="monofont">X</TT> is used before being assigned.<FOnt siZE="1"><SUp><a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a></sup></font>
</p>


<blockQuOte><fOnT SiZE="1">
<p ClASS="footnote">
<Sup><a nAME="FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</A></sup>
In fact, <i>any</I> assignment in a function body
makes a name local: <TT Class="monofont">import</TT>, <TT class="monofont">=</tt>,
nested <tt class="monofont">def</tt>s, nested <tt clAsS="monofont">class</tt>es,
and so on.</p>
</FoNT></bLOcKqUOTE>






<h5>4.6.1.1
Solution</h5>


<p>The problem occurs because assigned names are treated as locals
everywhere in a function, not just after statements where they are
assigned. Really, the code above is ambiguous at best: did you mean
to print the global <tT CLAss="monofont">X</tt> and then create a local
<TT CLass="monofont">X</tT>, or is this a genuine programming error? Since
Python treats <TT Class="monofont">X</tt> as a local everywhere, it is an
error; but if you really mean to print global <tt class="monofont">X</tt>,
you need to declare it in a <tt claSs="monofont">global</Tt> statement:</p>



<pRe CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> def selector():</B>
... <b>    global X           </B># force X to be global (everywhere)
... <B>    print X</B>
... <B>    X = 88</b>
<b>...</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> selector()</B>
99</PRE>


<p>Remember, though, that this means the assignment also changes the
global <tt cLASS="monofont">X</tt>, not a local <tt CLASs="monofont">X</tt>. Within
a function, you can't use both local and global versions of the
same simple name. If you really meant to print the global and then
set a local of the same name, import the enclosing module and qualify
to get to the global version:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>X = 99</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def selector():</b>
...     <b>import </b>__<b>main</b>__<B>      </b># import enclosing module
...     <B>print </b>__<b>main</b>__<B>.X    </b> # qualify to get to global version of name
...     <B>X = 88               </B># unqualified X classified as local
...     <b>print X             </B> # prints local version of name
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>selector()</b>
99
88</PrE>


<P>Qualification (the <TT clasS="monofont">.X</TT> part) fetches a value from a
namespace object. The interactive namespace is a module called _
_<Tt claSS="monofont">main</TT>__, so __<tt clASS="monofont">main</Tt>_
_<tt class="monofont">.X</tt> reaches the global version of
<tt class="monofont">X</tt>. If that isn't<a NaMe="idx399"></a> clear, check out
<a href="lpython_cnode52.html">Chapter 5</a>.</P>








<H4>4.6.2
Nested Functions Aren't Nested Scopes</h4>


<P>As we've seen, the Python <tT CLAss="monofont">def</tt> is an
executable statement: when it runs, it assigns a new function object
to a name.<A NAMe="idx400"></a>
<a nAME="idx401"></A>
<a namE="idx402"></A> Because
it's a statement, it can appear anywhere a statement
can—even nested in other statements. For instance, it's
completely legal to nest a function <TT class="monofont">def</tt> inside an
<tt class="monofont">if</tt> statement, to select between alternative
definitions:</p>



<pre ClAss="monofont">if test:
    def func():          # define func this way
        ... 
else:
    def func():          # or else this way instead
        ...
...
func()</pRe>


<P>One way to understand this code is to realize that the
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">def</TT> is much like an <TT clasS="monofont">=</TT>
statement: it assigns a name at runtime. Unlike C, Python functions
don't need to be fully defined before the program runs. Since
<Tt claSS="monofont">def</TT> is an executable statement, it can also show
up nested inside another <tt clASS="monofont">def</Tt>. But unlike languages
such as Pascal, nested <tt class="monofont">defs</tt> don't imply
nested scopes in Python. For instance, consider this example that
defines a function (<tt class="monofont">outer</tt>), which in turn defines
and calls another function (<tT cLass="monofont">inner</Tt>) that calls
itself recursively:<FOnT SiZe="1"><SUP><A href="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</A></SUP></font>

<A NAMe="idx403"></a></p>


<bLOCKquote><font size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sUp><A namE="FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></SUp>
By "recursively," we
mean that the function is called again, before a prior call exits. In
this example, the function calls itself, but it could also call
another function that calls it, and so on. Recursion could be
replaced with a simple <TT cLaSS="monofont">while</TT> or
<tt clASS="monofont">for</Tt> loop here (all we're doing is counting
down to zero), but we're trying to make a point about
self-recursive function names and nesting. Recursion tends to be more
useful for processing data structures whose shape can't be
predicted when you're writing a program.</p>

... <b>        print i,      </b>     # i is in inner's local
... <b>        if i: inner(i-1)  </b> # not in my local or global!

  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 4, in inner
NameError: inner</Pre>


<p>This won't work. A nested <Tt CLaSS="monofont">def</tT> really only
assigns a new function object to a name in the enclosing
function's scope (namespace). Within the nested function, the
LGB three-scope rule still applies for all names. The nested function
has access only to its own local scope, the global scope in the
enclosing module, and the built-in names scope. It does
<i>not</I> have access to names in the enclosing
function's scope; no matter how deeply functions nest, each
sees only three scopes.</P>



<P>For instance, in the example above, the nested <Tt claSS="monofont">def</TT>
creates the name <tt clASS="monofont">inner</Tt> in the
<tt cLASS="monofont">outer</tt> function's local scope (like any other
assignment in <tt class="monofont">outer</tt> would). But inside the
<tt class="monofont">inner</tt> function, the name <Tt ClasS="monofont">inner</tT>
isn't visible; it doesn't live in
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">inner</TT>'s local scope, doesn't live in
the enclosing module's scope, and certainly isn't a
built-in. Because <TT clasS="monofont">inner</TT> has no access to names in
<Tt claSS="monofont">outer</TT>'s scope, the call to
<tt clASS="monofont">inner</Tt> from <tt class="monofont">inner</tt> fails and
raises an exception.</p>




<h5>4.6.2.1
Solution</h5>


<p>Don't expect scopes to nest in Python. This is really more a
matter of understanding than anomaly: the <tt clasS="monofont">def</tT>
statement is just an <i>object constructor</i>, not a
scope nester. However, if you really need access to the nested
function name from inside the nested function, simply force the
nested function's name out to the enclosing module's
scope with a <tT cLAsS="monofont">global</Tt> declaration in the outer
function. Since the nested function shares the global scope with the
enclosing function, it finds it there according to the LGB rule:</P>



<pRE CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> def outer(x):</B>
... <B>    global inner</B>
... <B>    def inner(i):          </b># assign in enclosing module
... <b>        print i,</b>
... <b>        if i: inner(i-1)  </B> # found in my global scope now
... <B>    inner(x)</B>
<B>...</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> outer(3)</b>
3 2 1 0</pRE>







<H4>4.6.3
Using Defaults to Save References</H4>


<p>Really,<a name="idx404"></a> nested functions have no access to
any names in an enclosing function, so this is actually a more
general gotcha than the example above implies. To get access to names
assigned prior to the nested function's <tt class="monofont">def</tt>
statement, you can also assign their values to the nested
function's arguments as defaults. Because default arguments
save their values when the <tt clAsS="monofont">def</tt> runs (not when the
function is actually called), they can squirrel away objects from the
enclosing function's scope:</p>



<PrE ClASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> def outer(x, y):</b>
... <B>    def inner(a=x, b=y):     </B># save outer's x,y bindings/objects
... <B>        return a**b         </B> # can't use x and y directly here
... <b>    return inner</b>
<b>...</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> x = outer(2, 4)</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> x()</B>
16</pre>


<p>Here, a call to <TT CLass="monofont">outer</tT> returns the new function
created by the nested <TT Class="monofont">def</tt>. When the nested
<tt class="monofont">def</tt> statement runs,
<tt claSs="monofont">inner</Tt>'s arguments <tt ClASs="monofont">a</TT> and
<tT cLASS="monofont">b</tt> are assigned the values of <tt CLASs="monofont">x</tt>
and <tT CLAss="monofont">y</tt> from the <TT CLass="monofont">outer</tt>
function's local scope. In effect,
<tt class="monofont">inner</tt>'s <tt clasS="monofont">a</tT> and
<tt cLaSS="monofont">b</tT> remembers the values of
<Tt ClASS="monofont">outer</Tt>'s <tt cLASS="monofont">x</tt> and
<tt CLASs="monofont">y</tt>. When <tT CLAss="monofont">a</tt> and
<tt class="monofont">b</tt> are used later in
<tt class="monofont">inner</Tt>'s body, they still refer to the values
<Tt clAsS="monofont">x </Tt>and <TT cLaSS="monofont">y</TT> had when
<tt clASS="monofont">outer</Tt> ran (even though <tt cLASS="monofont">outer</tt>
has already returned to its caller).<foNT SIze="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a></sup></font>

This scheme works in <tt ClAss="monofont">lambda</tT>s too, since
<tT ClASs="monofont">lambda</Tt>s are really just shorthand for
<TT CLass="monofont">def</tT>s:</P>


<BLockqUOTE><font SIZE="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a></sup>
In
computer-science lingo, this sort of behavior is usually called a
<i>closure—</i>an object that remembers values in
enclosing scopes, even though those scopes may not be around any
more. In Python, you need to explicitly list which values are to be
remembered, using argument defaults (or class object attributes, as
we'll see in <A href="lpython_cnode63.html">Chapter 6</a>).</P>
</fONt></BLoCkQUOTe>





<pre CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> def outer(x, y):</b>
... <b>    return lambda a=x, b=y: a**b</B>
<B>...</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> y = outer(2, 5)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> y()</b>
32</pRE>


<P>Note that defaults won't quite do the trick in the last
section's example, because the name <Tt class="monofont">inner</tt>
isn't assigned until the inner <tt class="monofont">def</tt> has
completed. Global declarations may be the best workaround for nested
functions that call themselves:</p>



<prE cLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>def outer(x):</b>
...     <B>def inner(i, self=inner):     </B># name not defined yet
...         <b>print i,</B>
...         <B>if i: self(i-1)</b>
...     <B>inner(x)</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>outer(3)</B>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in outer
NameError: inner</PRe>


<p>But if you're interested in exploring the <i>Twilight
Zone</i> of Python hackerage, you can instead save a mutable
object as a default and plug in a reference to
<TT CLass="monofont">inner</tT> after the fact, in the enclosing
function's body:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>def outer(x):</B>
...     <b>fillin = [None]</b>
...     <b>def inner(i, self=fillin):    </b># save mutable
...         <b>print i,</b>
...         <b>if i: self[0](i-1)        </b># assume it's set
...     <b>fillin[0] = inner             </b># plug value now
...     <b>inner(x)</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>outer(3)</b>
3 2 1 0</pre>


<p>Although this code illustrates Python properties (and just might
amaze your friends, coworkers, and grandmother), we don't
recommend it. In this example, it makes much more sense to avoid
function nesting altogether:</p>



<pRe ClasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def inner(i):            </B>  # define module level name
...     <B>print i,</b>
...     <B>if i: inner(i-1)       </B># no worries: it's a global
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def outer(x):</B>
...     <b>inner(x)</B>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>outer(3)</B>
3 2 1 0</Pre>


<p>As a rule of thumb, the easy way out is usually the right way out.</p>







<H4>4.6.4
Defaults and Mutable Objects</H4>


<P>D<A name="idx405"></A>
<A NAme="idx406"></a>
<a NAME="idx407"></a>efault argument
values are evaluated and saved when the <tt class="monofont">def</tt>
statement is run, not when the resulting function is called.
That's what you want, since it lets you save values from the
enclosing scope, as we've just seen. But since defaults retain
an object between calls, you have to be careful about changing
mutable defaults. For instance, the following function uses an empty
list as a default value and then changes it in place each time the
function is called:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def saver(x=[]):</B>          # saves away a list object
...     <b>x.append(1)          </B> # changes same object each time!
...     <b>print x</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>saver([2])              </B>  # default not used
[2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>saver()              </B>     # default used
[1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>saver()             </b>      # grows on each call
[1, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>saver()</B>
[1, 1, 1]</pRe>


<P>The problem is that there's just one list object here—the
one created when the <TT Class="monofont">def</TT> was executed. You
don't get a new list every time the function is called, so the
list grows with each new <TT clasS="monofont">append</TT>.</P>




<h5>4.6.4.1
Solution</h5>


<p>If that's not the behavior you wish, simply move the default
value into the function body; as long as the value resides in code
that's actually executed each time the function runs,
you'll get a new object each time through:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def saver(x=None):</b>
...     <b>if x is None:         </b># no argument passed?
... <b>        x = []         </b>   # run code to make a new list
...     <b>x.append(1)</b>           # changes new list object
...     <b>print x</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>saver([2])</b>
[2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>saver()               </b>    # doesn't grow here
[1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>saver()</b>
[1]</PrE>


<p>By the way, the <tt ClASs="monofont">if</TT> statement above could
<i>almost</I> be replaced by the assignment <tT CLAss="monofont">x
= x or []</tt>, which takes advantage of the fact that
Python's <TT CLass="monofont">or</tT> returns one of its operand
objects: if no argument was passed, <TT Class="monofont">x</TT> defaults to
<TT class="monofont">None</tt>, so the <tt class="monofont">or</tt> returns the new
empty list on the right. This isn't exactly the same, though:
when an empty list is passed in, the function extends and returns a
newly created list, rather than extending and returning the passed-in
list like the previous version (the expression becomes
<tt clAsS="monofont">[]</tt> <tT cLAsS="monofont">or</Tt> <Tt CLASs="monofont">[]</tt>,
which evaluates to the new empty list on the right; see the
discussion of truth tests in <a href="lpython_cnode31.html">Chapter 3</a> if you
don't recall why). Since real program requirements may call for
either behavior, we won't pick a <a naME="idx408"></A>winner here.</P>
