<h3>5.6
Odds and Ends</h3>


<p>In this section, we introduce a few module-related ideas that seem
important enough to stand on their own (or obscure enough to defy our
organizational skills).</p>




<H4>5.6.1
Module Compilation Model</H4>


<P>As
currently<A name="idx441"></A> implemented, the Python system is often
called an interpreter, but it's really somewhere between a
classic interpreter and compiler. As in Java, Python programs are
compiled to an intermediate form called
<A NAme="idx442"></a>bytecode, which is
then executed on something called a virtual machine. Since the Python
virtual machine interprets the bytecode form, we can get away with
saying that Python is interpreted, but it still goes through a
compile phase first.</p>



<P>Luckily, the compile step is completely automated and hidden in
Python. Python programmers simply import modules and use the names
they define; Python takes care to automatically compile modules to
bytecode when they are first imported. Moreover, Python tries to save
a module's bytecode in a file, so it can avoid recompiling in
the future if the source code hasn't been changed. In effect,
Python comes with an automatic <I>make</I> system to
manage recompiles<I>.<font size="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a></sup></FoNt>
</i></p>


<BlOCkQUoTe><FONT size="1">
<P CLAss="footnote">
<suP><A NAme="FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a></sUP>
For readers who have
never used C or C++, a <I>make</I> system is a way to
automate compiling and linking programs. <i>make</i>
systems typically use file modification dates to know when a file
must be recompiled (just like Python).</p>
</font></blockquote>





<p>Here's how this works. You may have noticed<a nAmE="idx443"></a>
<i>.pyc</i> files in your module directories after
running programs; these are the files Python generates to save a
module's bytecode (provided you have write access to source
directories). When a module <I>M</i> is imported,
Python loads a <I>M.pyc</I> bytecode file instead of the
corresponding <i>M.py</I> source file, as long as the
<I>M.py</i>
<A nAME="idx444"></A> file hasn't been changed since the
<i>M.pyc</i> bytecode was saved. If you change the
source code file (or delete the <i>.pyc</i>), Python is
smart enough to recompile the module when imported; if not, the saved
bytecode files make your program start quicker by avoiding recompiles
at runtime.</P>



<P><TAble cELLSpaciNG="0" WIdth="90%" border="1"><tr><td>

<center><h2>
Why You Will Care: Shipping Options</H2></cEnteR>


<p>Incidentally, compiled <A NaME="idx445"></a><I>.pyc</i>
bytecode<A NAMe="idx446"></a> <a nAME="idx447"></A> files also happen to be one way to ship
a system without source code. Python happily loads a
<i>.pyc</i> file if it can't find a
<i>.py</i> source file for a module on its module search
path, so all you really need to ship to customers are the
<I>.pyc</I> files. Moreover, since Python bytecode is
portable, you can usually run a <I>.pyc</I> file on
multiple platforms. To force pre-compilation into
<i>.pyc</i> files, simply import your modules (also see
the <tt CLASs="monofont">compileall</tt> utility module).</p>



<p>It's also possible to "<a name="idx448"></a>freeze" Python programs into a C
executable; the standard <tt class="monofont">freeze</tt> tool packages your
program's compiled byte code, any Python utilities it uses, and
as much of the C code of the Python interpreter as needed to run your
program. It produces a C program, which you compile with a generated
<I>makefile</i> to produce a standalone executable
program. The executable works the same as the Python files of your
program. Frozen executables don't require a Python interpreter
to be installed on the target machine and may start up faster; on the
other hand, since the bulk of the interpreter is included, they
aren't small. A similar tool, <Tt clAsS="monofont">squeeze</Tt>,
packages Python bytecode in a Python program; search Python's
web site for details.</P>

<h4>5.6.2
Data Hiding Is a Convention</h4>


<P>As we've seen,
Python<A NAme="idx449"></a> <a NAME="idx450"></a> modules export all names assigned at the
top level of their file. There is no notion of declaring which names
should and shouldn't be visible outside the module. In fact,
there's no way to prevent a client from changing names inside a
module if they want to.</p>



<p>In Python, data hiding in modules is a convention, not a syntactical
constraint. If you want to break a module by trashing its names, you
can (though we have yet to meet a programmer who would want to). Some
purists object to this liberal attitude towards data hiding and claim
that it means Python can't implement encapsulation. We disagree
(and doubt we could convince purists of anything in any event).
Encapsulation in Python is more about packaging, than
restricting.<fONT Size="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></sup></font>
</p>


<BlOckqUoTE><fONt SiZE="1">
<P Class="footnote">
<SUP><A name="FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</A></SUP>
Purists would probably also be horrified
by the rogue C++ programmer who types <tt clASS="monofont">#define private
public</Tt> to break C++'s hiding mechanism in a single
blow. But then those are rogue programmers for you.</p>
</font></blockquote>





<p>As a special case, prefixing names with an underscore (e.g.,
<tt cLaSs="monofont">_X</tt>) prevents them from being copied out when a
client imports with a <Tt CLaSS="monofont">from*</tT> statement. This really
is intended only to minimize <i>namespace
pollution</I>;since
<TT Class="monofont">from*</TT> copies out all names, you may get more than
you bargained for (including names which overwrite names in the
importer). But underscores aren't "private"
declarations: you can still see and change such names with other
<TT clasS="monofont">import</TT> forms.<A name="idx451"></A></P>







<A Name="idx500"></a><h4>5.6.3
Mixed Modes: __name__ and __main__</h4>


<p>Here's a special module-related trick that lets you both import
a module from clients and run it as a standalone program. Each module
has a built-in attribute called __<tt class="monofont">name</tt>__, which
Python sets as follows:</p>



<ul>
<lI><p>If the file is being run as a program, __<Tt clAsS="monofont"> name </Tt>_
_ is set to the string __<TT cLaSS="monofont"> main </TT>__ when it starts</p>
</li>
<lI><P>If the file is being imported, __<TT clasS="monofont">name</TT>__ is set
to the module's name as known by its clients</P>
</li>
</ul>
<P>The upshot is that a module can test its own _
_<TT Class="monofont">name</tt>__ to determine whether it's being run
or imported. For example, suppose we create the module file below, to
export a single function called <tt class="monofont">tester</tt>:</p>



<pre cLaSs="monofont">def tester():
    print "It's Christmas in Heaven..."

if __name__ == '__main__':         # only when run
    tester()                       # not when imported</prE>


<p>This module defines a function for clients to import and use as usual:</P>



<PrE ClAsS="monofont">% <B>python</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> import runme</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> runme.tester()</b>
It's Christmas in Heaven...</pRE>


<P>But the module also includes code at the bottom that is set up to
call the function when this file is run as a program:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">% <b>python runme.py</b>
It's Christmas in Heaven...</prE>


<P>Perhaps the most common place you'll see the _
_<TT class="monofont">main</tt>__ test applied is for <i>self-test
code</i>: you can package code that tests a module's
exports in the module itself by wrapping it in a __ <tt class="monofont">main
</tt>__ test at the bottom. This way, you can use the file in
clients and test its logic by running it from the system shell.</p>







<h4>5.6.4
Changing the Module Search Path</H4>


<p>We've mentioned that
the<A namE="idx452"></a> module search path is a list of
directories in environment variable <TT cLAsS="monofont">PYTHONPATH</tT>.
What we haven't told you is that a Python program can actually
change the search path, by assigning to a built-in list called
<TT Class="monofont">sys.path</TT> (the <TT clasS="monofont">path</TT> attribute in
the built-in <Tt claSS="monofont">sys</TT> module).
<tt class="monofont">sys.path</tt>
<a name="idx453"></a> is initialized from
<tt claSs="monofont">PYTHONPATH</Tt> (plus compiled-in defaults) on startup,
but thereafter, you can delete, append, and reset its components
however you like:</p>



<pRe CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import sys</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>sys.path</B>
['.', 'c:\\python\\lib', 'c:\\python\\lib\\tkinter']

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>sys.path = ['.']                            </B># change module search path
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>sys.path.append('c:\\book\\examples')       </b># escape backlashes as "\\"
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>sys.path</b>
['.', 'c:\\book\\examples']

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import string</B>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
ImportError: No module named string</PRE>


<p>You can use this to dynamically configure a search path inside a
Python program. Be careful, though; if you delete a critical
directory from the path, you may lose access to critical utilities.
In the last command above, for example, we no longer have access to
the <tt cLASS="monofont">string</tt> module, since we deleted the Python
source library's directory from the path.</p>







<a NAME="idx503"></a><a name="idx504"></a><h4>5.6.5
Module Packages (New in 
1.5)</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx454"></a>Packages
are an advanced tool, and we debated whether to cover them in this
book. But since you may run across them in other people's code,
here's a quick overview of their machinery.</p>



<p>In short, Python packages allow you to import modules using directory
paths; qualified names in <tt ClAss="monofont">import</tT> statements
reflect the directory structure on your machine. For instance, if
some module <tT ClASs="monofont">C</Tt> lives in a directory
<TT CLass="monofont">B</tT>, which is in turn a subdirectory of directory
<TT Class="monofont">A</TT>, you can say <TT clasS="monofont">import A.B.C</TT> to
load the module. Only directory <Tt class="monofont">A</tt> needs to be
found in a directory listed in the <tt class="monofont">PYTHONPATH</tt>
variable, since the path from <tt cLaSs="monofont">A</tt> to
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">C</tT> is given by qualification.</p>



<P>Packages come in handy when integrating systems written by
independent developers; by storing each system's set of modules
in its own subdirectory, we can reduce the risk of name clashes. For
instance, if each developer writes a module called
<I>spam.py</I>, there's no telling which will be
found on <Tt claSS="monofont">PYTHONPATH</TT> first if package qualifier
paths aren't used. If another subsystem's directory
appears on <tt clASS="monofont">PYTHONPATH</Tt> first, a subsystem may see
the wrong one.</p>



<p>Again, if you're new to Python, make sure that you've
mastered simple modules before stepping up to packages. Packages are
more complex than we've described here; for instance, each
directory used as a package must include a __ <tT CLAss="monofont">init
</tt>__<tt class="monofont">.py</tt> module to identify itself as
such. See Python's reference manuals for the whole story.</p>

Why You Will Care: Module Packages</H2></CEnter>


<P>Now that packages are a standard part of Python, you're likely
to start seeing third-party extensions shipped as a set of package
directories, rather than a flat list of modules. The PythonWin port
of Python for MS-Windows was one of the first to jump on the package
bandwagon. Many of its utility modules reside in packages, which you
import with qualification paths; for instance, to load client-side
COM tools, we say:</P>


<PRe class="monofont">from win32com.client import constants, Dispatch</pre>

<p>which fetches names from the <tt class="monofont">client</tt> module of the
PythonWin <tT cLass="monofont">win32com</Tt> package (an install directory).
We'll see more about COM in <A href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a>.</P>

<H4>5.6.6
Module Design Concepts</H4>


<P>Like functions,<a namE="idx455"></A> modules present design tradeoffs:
deciding which functions go in which module, module communication
mechanisms, and so on. Here too, it's a bigger topic than this
book allows, so we'll just touch on a few general ideas that
will become clearer when you start writing bigger Python systems:</P>



<Dl>
<dt>
<i><FONT color="#990000">You're always in a module in Python</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>There's no way to write code that doesn't live in some
module. In fact, code typed at the interactive prompt really goes in
a built-in module called __<tt claSs="monofont">main</Tt> __.</p>
</dD>
<dT>
<I><fONt CoLOR="#990000">Minimize module coupling: global variables</Font></i></DT>
<DD>
<p>Like functions, modules work best if they're written to be
closed boxes. As a rule of thumb, they should be as independent of
global names in other modules as possible.</p>
</dd>
<DT>
<I><Font cOLOR="#990000">Maximize module cohesion: unified purpose</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>You can minimize a module's couplings by maximizing its
cohesion; if all the components of a module share its general
purpose, you're less likely to depend on external names.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><font CoLor="#990000">Modules should rarely change other modules' variables</fOnT></I></dT>
<Dd>
<P>It's perfectly okay to use globals defined in another module
(that's how clients import services, after all), but changing
globals in another module is usually a symptom of a design problem.
There are exceptions of course, but you should try to communicate
results through devices such as function return values, not
cross-module changes.</p>
</DD>
</DL>





<a namE="7"></A>
<H4>5.6.7
Modules Are Objects: Metaprograms</H4>


<p>Finally, because<a naME="idx456"></A>
modules expose most of their interesting properties as built-in
attributes, it's easy to write programs that manage other
programs. We usually call such manager programs
<I>metaprograms</i>
<a naME="idx457"></A>,
because they work on top of other systems. This is also referred to
as <I>introspection</i>, because programs can see and
process object internals.</p>



<p>For instance, to get to an attribute called <tt class="monofont">name</tt>
in a module called <tt class="monofont">M</tT>, we can either use
qualification, or index the module's attribute dictionary
exposed in the built-in <a Name="idx458"></A>_
_<tT ClASs="monofont">dict</Tt>__ attribute. Further, Python also exports
the list of all loaded modules as the
<TT CLass="monofont">sys.modules</tT>
<A NAme="idx459"></a> dictionary (that is, the
<tT CLAss="monofont">modules</tt> attribute of the <TT CLass="monofont">sys</tt>
module), and provides a built-in called <tt class="monofont">getattr</tt>
that lets us fetch attributes from their string names. Because of
that, all the following expressions reach the same attribute and
object:</p>



<pre clAsS="monofont">M.name                          # qualify object
M.__dict__['name']             # index namespace dictionary manually
sys.modules['M'].name           # index loaded-modules table manually
getattr(M, 'name')              # call built-in fetch function</pre>


<P>By exposing module internals like this, Python helps you build
programs about programs.<fONt SIzE="1"><sUP><A Href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a></SUP></Font>
 For example,
here is a module that puts these ideas to work, to implement a
customized version of the built-in <tT CLAss="monofont">dir</tt> function.
It defines and exports a function called <TT CLass="monofont">listing</tt>,
which takes a module object as an argument and prints a formatted
listing of the module's namespace:</p>


<blockquote><font SiZe="1">
<p cLaSS="footnote">
<sUP><a NaME="FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</A></Sup>
Notice that because a
function can access its enclosing module by going through the
<tt CLASs="monofont">sys.modules</tt> table like this, it's possible
to emulate the effect of the <tT CLAss="monofont">global</tt> statement we
met in <A href="lpython_cnode42.html">Chapter 4</a>. For instance, the effect of
<tt class="monofont">global</tt> <tt class="monofont">X;</tt>
<Tt ClasS="monofont">X=0</tT> can be simulated by saying, inside a function:
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">import sys; glob=sys.modules[</TT>_
_<TT clasS="monofont">name</TT>__ <Tt claSS="monofont">];</TT>
<tt clASS="monofont">glob.X=0</Tt> (albeit with much more typing). Remember,
each module gets a __ <tt class="monofont">name</tt>__ attribute for free;
it's visible as a global name inside functions within a module.
This trick provides a way to change both local and global variables
of the same name, inside a function.</p>
