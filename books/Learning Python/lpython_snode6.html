<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>


<p>We'd like to express our gratitude to all the people who played
a part in developing this book, but this is too short a book to list
them all. But we'd like to give a special thanks to our editor,
Frank Willison, and O'Reilly in general, for supporting another
Python book. Thanks also to everyone who took part in the early
review of this book—Eric Raymond, Guido van Rossum, Just van
Rossum, Andrew Kuchling, Dennis Allison, Greg Ward, and Jennifer
Tanksley. And for creating such an enjoyable and useful language, we
owe an especially large debt to Guido, and the rest of the Python
community; like most freeware systems, Python is the product of many
heroic efforts.</p>




<H4>Mark Also Says:</H4>


<P>Since writing <I>Programming Python</i>, I've had
the opportunity to travel around the country teaching Python to
beginners. Besides racking up frequent flyer miles, these courses
helped me refine the core language material you'll see in the
first part of this book. I'd like to thank the early students
of my course, at Badger, Lawrence Livermore, and Fermi Labs, in
particular. Your feedback played a big role in shaping my
contributions to this text. I also want to give a special thanks to
Softronex, for the chance to teach Python in Puerto Rico this summer
(a better perk would be hard to imagine).</p>



<p>Finally, a few personal notes of thanks. To coauthor David Ascher,
for his hard work and patience on this project. To the people I
worked with at Lockheed Martin while writing this book, including my
teammate Linda Cordova, to whom I've lost a bet or two. To the
late Carl Sagan, for inspiration. To Lao Tzu, for deep thoughts. To
the Denver Broncos, for winning the big one. And most of all, to my
wife Lisa, and my kids—a set which now consists of Michael,
Samantha, and Roxanne—for tolerating yet another book project.
I owe the latter bunch a trip to Wally World.</p>

<H4>David Also Says:</H4>


<P>In addition to the thanks listed above, I'd like to extend
special thanks to several people.</P>



<p>First, thanks to Mark Lutz for inviting me to work with him on this
book and for supporting my efforts as a Python trainer. Belated thank
yous go to the Python folks who encouraged me in my early days with
the language and its tools, especially Guido, Tim Peters, Don
Beaudry, and Andrew Mullhaupt.</p>



<p>Like Mark, I've developed a course in which I teach Python and
JPython. The students in these courses have helped me identify the
parts of Python that are the trickiest to learn (luckily, they are
rare), as well as remind me of the aspects of the language that make
it so pleasant to use. I thank them for their feedback. I would also
like to thank those who have given me the chance to develop these
courses: Jim Anderson (Brown University), Cliff Dutton (then at
Distributed Data Systems), Geoffrey Philbrick (Hibbitt, Karlsson
&amp; Sorensen, Inc.), Paul Dubois (Lawrence Livermore National
Labs), and Ken Swisz (KLA-Tencor).</p>



<P>Thanks to my scientific advisors, Jim Anderson, Leslie Welch, and
Norberto Grzywacz, who have all kindly supported my efforts with
Python in general and this book in particular, not necessarily
understanding why I was doing it but trusting me nonetheless.</P>



<P>The first victims of my Python evangelization efforts deserve gold
stars for tolerating my most enthusiastic (some might say fanatical)
early days: Thanassi Protopapas, Gary Strangman, and Steven Finney.
Thanassi also gave his typically useful feedback on an early draft of
the book.</P>



<p>Finally, thanks to my family: my parents JacSue and Philippe for
always encouraging me to do what I want to do; my brother Ivan for
reminding me of some of my early encounters with programming; my wife
Emily for her constant support and utter faith that writing a book
was something I could do. I thank our son Hugo for letting me use the
keyboard at least some of the time, and only learning how to turn the
computer off in the last phase of this project. He was three days old
when I received the first email from Mark about this book. He's
eighteen months old now. It's been a great year and a half.</p>



<p>To the reader of this book, I hope you enjoy the book and through it,
the Python language. Through Python, I've learned more than I
ever thought I'd want to about many aspects of computing that
once seemed foreboding. My aim in helping write this book was to
allow others the same experience. If your aim in learning Python is
to work on a specific problem, I hope that Python becomes so
transparent that it becomes invisible, letting you focus your efforts
on the issues you're dealing with. I suspect, however, that at
least a few readers will have the same reaction that I had when
discovering Python, which was to find in Python itself a world worth
learning more about. If that's the case for you, be aware that
exploring Python is not necessarily a short-term project. After
countless hours, I'm still poking around, and still having fun.</p>
