<h3>5.7
Module Gotchas</h3>


<p>Finally, here is the usual collection of boundary cases, which make
life interesting for beginners. Some are so obscure it was hard to
come up with examples, but most illustrate <a NAME="idx461"></a> <a naME="idx462"></A>something
important about Python.</P>




<h4>5.7.1
Importing Modules by Name String</h4>


<p>As we've seen, the module name in an
<tT CLAss="monofont">import</tt>
<a name="idx463"></a> or <tt class="monofont">from</tt>
statement is a hardcoded variable name; you can't use these
statements directly to load a module given its name as a Python
string. For instance:</p>



<PrE claSs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> import "string"</B>
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
    import "string"
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</pRE>



<h5>5.7.1.1
Solution</H5>


<p>You need to use special tools to load modules dynamically, from a
string that exists at runtime. The most general approach is to
construct an <TT CLass="monofont">import</tT> statement as a string of
Python code and pass it to the <TT Class="monofont">exec</TT> statement to
run:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>modname = "string"</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>exec "import " + modname      </b> # run a string of code
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>string                        </b> # imported in this namespace
&lt;module 'string'&gt;</pre>


<p>The <tt class="monofont">exec</tt> statement (and its cousin, the
<tt ClAss="monofont">eval</tT> function) compiles a string of code, and
passes it to the Python interpreter to be executed. In Python, the
bytecode compiler is available at runtime, so you can write programs
that construct and run other programs like this. By default,
<tT ClASs="monofont">exec</Tt> runs the code in the current scope, but you
can get more specific by passing in optional namespace dictionaries.
We'll say more about these tools later in this book.</P>



<P>The only real drawback to <TT clasS="monofont">exec</TT> is that it must
compile the <Tt claSS="monofont">import</TT> statement each time it runs; if
it runs many times, you might be better off using the built-in __
<tt clASS="monofont">import </Tt>__ function to load from a name string
instead. The effect is similar, but __<tt class="monofont"> import </tt>__
returns the module object, so we assign it to a name here:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>modname = "string"</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>string = </B>__<b>import</b>__<b>(modname)</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>string</B>
&lt;module 'string'&gt;</PrE>







<H4>5.7.2
from Copies Names but Doesn't Link</h4>


<P>Earlier, we mentioned that the
<tT CLAss="monofont">from</tt>
<A NAMe="idx464"></a>
statement is really an <i>assignment</i> to names in
the importer's scope—a name-copy operation, not a name
aliasing. The implications of this are the same as for all
assignments in Python, but subtle, especially given that the code
that shares objects lives in different files. For instance, suppose
we define a module <TT CLass="monofont">nested1</tT> as follows:</P>



<PRe class="monofont">X = 99
def printer(): print X</pre>


<p>Now, if we import its two names using <tt class="monofont">from</tt> in
another module, we get copies of those names, not links to them.
Changing a name in the importer resets only the binding of the local
version of that name, not the name in <tT cLass="monofont">nested1</Tt>:</P>



<PrE ClAsS="monofont">from nested1 import X, printer    # copy names out
X = 88                            # changes my "X" only!
printer()                         # nested1's X is still 99

% <B>python nested2.py</B>
99</Pre>



<h5>5.7.2.1
Solution</h5>


<P>On the other hand, if you use <TT Class="monofont">import</TT> to get the
whole module and assign to a <I>qualified</I> name, you
change the name in <tt clASS="monofont">nested1</Tt>. Qualification directs
Python to a name in the module object, rather than a name in the
importer:</p>



<pre class="monofont">import nested1                    # get module as a whole
nested1.X = 88                    # okay: change nested1's X
nested1.printer() 

% <b>python nested3.py</b>
88</pre>







<h4>5.7.3
Statement Order Matters in Top-Level Code</h4>


<p>As we also saw earlier, when a module is first imported (or
reloaded), Python executes its <a nAmE="idx465"></a>statements one by one, from the top of
file to the bottom. This has a few subtle implications regarding
<a nAmE="idx466"></A>forward
references that are worth underscoring here:</p>



<UL>
<lI><p>Code at the top level of a module file (not nested in a function)
runs as soon as Python reaches it during an import; because of that,
it can't reference names assigned lower in the file.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>Code inside a function body doesn't run until the function is
called; because names in a function aren't resolved until the
function actually runs, they can usually reference names anywhere in
the file.</p>
</lI>
</UL>
<P>In general, forward references are only a concern in top-level module
code that executes immediately; functions can reference names
arbitrarily. Here's an example that illustrates forward
reference dos and don'ts:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">func1()               # error: "func1" not yet assigned

def func1():
    print func2()     # okay:  "func2" looked up later

func1()               # error: "func2" not yet assigned

def func2():
    return "Hello"

func1()               # okay:  "func1" and "func2" assigned</pre>


<P>When this file is imported (or run as a standalone program), Python
executes its statements from top to bottom. The first call to
<TT Class="monofont">func1</tt> fails because the <tt class="monofont">func1</tt>
<tt claSs="monofont">def</Tt> hasn't run yet. The call to
<tt ClASs="monofont">func2</TT> inside <tT cLASS="monofont">func1</tt> works as
long as <tt CLASs="monofont">func2</tt>'s <tT CLAss="monofont">def</tt> has
been reached by the time <TT CLass="monofont">func1</tt> is called (it
hasn't when the second top-level <tt class="monofont">func1</tt> call
is run). The last call to <tt clasS="monofont">func1 </tT>at the bottom of
the file works, because <tt cLaSS="monofont">func1</tT> and
<Tt ClASS="monofont">func2</Tt> have both been assigned.</p>




<h5>5.7.3.1
Solution</h5>


<P>Don't do that. Mixing <TT Class="monofont">defs</TT> with top-level
code is not only hard to read, it's dependent on statement
ordering. As a rule of thumb, if you need to mix immediate code with
<TT clasS="monofont">defs</TT>, put your <Tt class="monofont">defs</tt> at the top
of the file and top-level code at the bottom. That way, your
functions are defined and assigned by the time code that uses them
runs.</p>








<h4>5.7.4
Recursive "from" Imports May Not Work</h4>


<p>Because imports execute a file's statements from top to bottom,
we sometimes need to be careful when using modules that import each
other (something called <i>recursive
imports</i>
<a name="idx467"></a>
<A nAme="idx468"></a>). Since
the statements in a module have not all been run when it imports
another module, some of its names may not yet exist. If you use
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">import</tT> to fetch a module as a whole, this may or
may not matter; the module's names won't be accessed
until you later use qualification to fetch their values. But if you
use <tT CLAss="monofont">from</tt> to fetch specific names, you only have
access to names already assigned.</P>



<P>For instance, take the following modules <TT clasS="monofont">recur1</TT>
and <Tt claSS="monofont">recur2</TT>. <tt class="monofont">recur1</tt> assigns a
name <tt class="monofont">X</tt>, and then imports
<tt ClAss="monofont">recur2</tT>, <i>before</I> assigning name
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">Y</TT>. At this point, <TT clasS="monofont">recur2</TT> can
fetch <Tt claSS="monofont">recur1</TT> as a whole with an
<tt clASS="monofont">import</Tt> (it already exists in Python's
internal modules table), but it can see only name
<tt class="monofont">X</tt> if it uses <tt class="monofont">from</tt>; the name
<tT cLass="monofont">Y</Tt> below the <TT cLAsS="monofont">import</tT> in
<TT Class="monofont">recur1</TT> doesn't yet exist, so you get an
error:</P>



<P><i>module recur1.py</i></p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">X = 1
import recur2             # run recur2 now if doesn't exist
Y = 2</pRE>


<P><I>module recur2.py</i></p>



<pre class="monofont">from recur1 import X      # okay: "X" already assigned
from recur1 import Y      # error: "Y" not yet assigned

&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> import recur1</b>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "recur1.py", line 2, in ?
    import recur2
  File "recur2.py", line 2, in ?
    from recur1 import Y   # error: "Y" not yet assigned
ImportError: cannot import name Y</pre>


<p>Python is smart enough to avoid rerunning
<tt clAsS="monofont">recur1</tt>'s statements when they are imported
recursively from <tT cLAsS="monofont">recur2</Tt> (or else the imports would
send the script into an infinite loop), but
<Tt CLASs="monofont">recur1</tt>'s namespace is incomplete when
imported by <tT CLAss="monofont">recur2</tt>.</P>




<H5>5.7.4.1
Solutions</H5>


<P>Don't do that....really! Python won't get stuck in a
cycle, but your programs will once again be dependent on the order of
statements in modules. There are two ways out of this gotcha:</p>



<ul>
<lI><P>You can usually eliminate import cycles like this by careful design;
maximizing cohesion and minimizing coupling are good first steps.</P>
</Li>
<li><p>If you can't break the cycles completely, postpone module name
access by using <tt class="monofont">import</tt> and qualification (instead
of <tt class="monofont">from)</Tt>, or running your <Tt clAsS="monofont">from
</Tt>s inside functions (instead of at the top level of the
module).</P>
</Li>
</Ul>







<A NAMe="idx520"></a><h4>5.7.5

reload May Not Impact from Imports</h4>


<P>The <TT Class="monofont">from</TT> statement is the source of all sorts of
gotchas in Python. Here's another: because
<TT clasS="monofont">from</TT> copies (assigns) names when run,
there's no link back to the module where the names came from.
Names imported with <Tt class="monofont">from</tt> simply become references
to objects, which happen to have been referenced by the same names in
the importee when the <tt class="monofont">from</tt> ran. Because of this
behavior, reloading the importee has no effect on clients that use
<tt cLaSs="monofont">from</tt>; the client's names still reference the
objects fetched with <Tt CLaSS="monofont">from</tT>, even though names in
the original module have been reset:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">from module import X       # X may not reflect any module reloads!
. . .
reload(module)             # changes module, not my names
X                          # still references old object</PRE>



<H5>5.7.5.1
Solution</h5>


<p>Don't do it that way. To make reloads more effective, use
<tt CLASs="monofont">import</tt> and name qualification, instead of
<tT CLAss="monofont">from</tt>. Because qualifications always go back to the
module, they will find the new bindings of module names after calling
<tt class="monofont">reload</tt>:</p>



<pre claSs="monofont">import module              # get module, not names
. . .
reload(module)             # changes module in-place
module.X                   # get current X: reflects module reloads</Pre>







<h4>5.7.6
reload Isn't Applied Transitively</H4>


<p>When you reload a module, Python only reloads that particular
module's file; it doesn't automatically reload modules
that the file being reloaded happens to import. For example, if we
reload some module A, and A imports modules B and C, the reload only
applies to A, not B and C. The statements inside A that import B and
C are rerun during the reload, but they'll just fetch the
already loaded B and C module objects (assuming they've been
imported before):</P>



<PrE ClAsS="monofont">% <B>cat A.py</B>
import B                   # not reloaded when A is
import C                   # just an import of an already loaded module

%<B> python</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; . . . 
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>reload(A)</b></pRE>



<H5>5.7.6.1
Solution</H5>


<p>Don't depend on that. Use multiple <tt cLASS="monofont">reload</tt>
calls to update subcomponents independently. If desired, you can
design your systems to reload their subcomponents automatically by
adding <tt CLASs="monofont">reload</tt> calls in parent modules like
<tt class="monofont">A</tt>
<a name="idx469"></a> <a nAmE="idx470"></a>.<foNt SIzE="1"><SuP><a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a></sup></FONT>
</p>


<bloCKQUote><fONT Size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a></suP>
You could also write a
general tool to do transitive reloads automatically, by scanning
module __ <tT claSs="monofont">dict </TT>__s (see the section <a href="lpython_snode59.html#7">Section 5.6.7</a>), and checking each item's
<TT CLass="monofont">type()</tT> to find nested modules to reload
recursively. This is an advanced exercise for the ambitious.</P>
