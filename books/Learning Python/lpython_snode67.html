<h3>6.3
Using the Class Statement</h3>


<p>Did all of the above make sense? If not, don't worry; now that
we've had a quick tour, we're going to dig a bit deeper
and study the concepts we've introduced in more detail. We met
the <tT CLAss="monofont">class</tt>
<A NAMe="idx504"></a>
statement in our first examples, but let's formalize some of
the ideas we introduced. As in C++, the <tt CLASs="monofont">class</tt>
statement is Python's main OOP tool. Unlike in C++,
<tt class="monofont">class</tt> isn't really a declaration; like
<tt class="monofont">def</tT>, <tT claSs="monofont">class</TT> is an object
builder, and an implicit assignment—when run, it generates a
class object, and stores a reference to it in the name used in the
header.</p>




<H4>6.3.1
General Form</H4>


<p>As we saw on our quick tour, <Tt CLASs="monofont">class</tt> is a compound
statement with a body of indented statements under it. In the header,
superclasses are listed in parentheses after the class name,
separated by commas. Listing more than one superclass leads to
multiple inheritance (which we'll say more about later in this
chapter):</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">class &lt;name&gt;(superclass,...):       # assign to name
    data = value                    # shared class data
    def method(self,...):           # methods
        self.member = value         # per-instance data</PRE>


<P>Within the class statement, specially-named methods overload
operators; for instance, a function called <tt clASS="monofont"> </Tt>_
_<tt class="monofont"> init</tt> __<tt class="monofont"> </tt> is called at
instance object construction time, if defined.</p>







<H4>6.3.2
Example</h4>


<P>At the start of this chapter, we mentioned that classes are mostly
just
<i>namespaces—</i>
<a NaME="idx505"></a>a tool for defining names
(called attributes) that export data and logic to clients. So how do
you get from the statement to a namespace?</P>



<P>Here's how. Just as with modules, the statements nested in a
<tT cLASS="monofont">class</tt> statement body create its attributes. When
Python executes a <tt CLASs="monofont">class</tt> statement (not a call to a
class), it runs all the statements in its body from top to bottom.
Assignments that happen during this process create names in the
class's local scope, which become attributes in the associated
class object. Because of this, classes resemble both modules and
functions:</p>



<UL>
<LI><p>Like functions, <tt cLASS="monofont">class</tt> statements are a local scope
where names created by nested assignments live.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Like modules, names assigned in a <tt class="monofont">class</tt> statement
become attributes in a class object.</p>
</li>
</Ul>
<P>The main distinction for classes is that their namespaces are also
the basis of inheritance in Python; attributes are fetched from other
classes if not found in a class or instance object. Because
<tt cLaSS="monofont">class</tT> is a compound statement, any sort of
statement can be nested inside its body—for instance,
<Tt ClASS="monofont">print</Tt>, <tt cLASS="monofont">=</tt>,
<tt CLASs="monofont">if</tt>, and <tT CLAss="monofont">def</tt>. As we've
seen, nested <tt class="monofont">defs</tt> make class methods, but other
assignments make attributes too. For example, suppose we run the
following class:</p>



<pre claSs="monofont">class Subclass(aSuperclass):               # define subclass
    data = 'spam'                          # assign class attr
    def __init__(self, value):             # assign class attr
        self.data = value                  # assign instance attr
    def display(self):
        print self.data, Subclass.data     # instance, class</Pre>


<p>This class contains two <Tt CLaSS="monofont">defs</tT>, which bind class
attributes to method functions. It also contains a
<tT CLAss="monofont">=</tt> assignment statement; since the name
<TT CLass="monofont">data</tT> is assigned inside the
<TT Class="monofont">class</TT>, it lives in the class's local scope
and becomes an attribute of the class object. Like all class
attributes, <TT class="monofont">data</tt> is inherited and
<i>shared</i> by all instances of the class:<font size="1"><sup><A hRef="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></SuP></FoNT>
</p>

If you've used C++, you may recognize this as similar to
the notion of C++'s <tt class="monofont">static</tt> class
data—members that are stored in the class, independent of
instances. In Python, it's nothing special: all class
attributes are just names assigned in the <tt claSs="monofont">class</Tt>
statement, whether they happen to reference functions (C++'s
<i>methods</i>) or something else (C++'s
<I>members</i>).</P>

<P>When we run this code, the name <TT Class="monofont">data</tt> lives in two
places—in instance objects (created in the <tt class="monofont">
</tt>__<tt claSs="monofont"> init </Tt>__<tt ClASs="monofont"> </TT>
constructor) <a NaME="idx506"></A> <A name="idx507"></A>
<A NAme="idx508"></a>and in the
class they inherit names from (created by the <tT CLAss="monofont">=</tt>
assignment). The class's <TT CLass="monofont">display</tt> method
prints both versions, by first qualifying the self instance, and then
the class itself. Since classes are objects with attributes, we can
get to their names by qualifying, even if there's no instance
involved.<a name="idx509"></a></p>
