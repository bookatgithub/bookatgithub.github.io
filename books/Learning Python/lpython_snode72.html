<h3>6.8
Designing with Classes</h3>


<p>So far, we've concentrated on the OOP tool in Python—the
class. But OOP is also about design issues—how to use classes
to model useful objects. In this section, we're going to touch
on a few OOP core ideas and look at some examples that are more
realistic than the ones we've seen so far. Most of the design
terms we throw out here require more explanation than we can provide;
if this section sparks your curiosity, we suggest exploring a text on
OOP design or design patterns as a next step.</p>




<H4>6.8.1
Python and OOP</H4>


<P>Python's implementation of <A name="idx540"></A>
<A NAme="idx541"></a>OOP can be summarized by three ideas:</p>



<A NAMe="idx542"></a><a name="idx543"></a><a name="idx544"></a><dl>
<dt>
<foNt ColoR="#990000">I<a NAmE="idx542"></A>nheritance</fOnT></DT>
<Dd>
<p>Is based on attribute lookup in Python (in <tt CLASs="monofont">X.name</tt>
expressions).</p>
</DD>
<DT>
<font COLOr="#990000">P<a name="idx543"></a>olymorphism</font></dt>
<dd>
<p>In <tt clAsS="monofont">X.method</tt>, the meaning of
<tT cLAsS="monofont">method</Tt> depends on the type (class) of
<Tt CLASs="monofont">X</tt>.</p>
</DD>
<DT>
<font COLOr="#990000">E<a naME="idx544"></A>ncapsulation</Font></dt>
<dd>
<p>Methods and operators implement behavior; data hiding is a convention
by default.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<p>By now, you should have a good feel for what inheritance is all about
in Python. Python's flavor of polymorphism flows from its lack
of type declarations. Because attributes are always resolved at
runtime, objects that implement the same interfaces are
interchangeable; clients don't need to know what sort of object
is implementing a method they call.<font siZe="1"><Sup><a HrEF="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a></SUp></FoNT>
 Encapsulation means
packaging in Python, not privacy; privacy is an option, as
we'll see later in this chapter.</P>


<BlockQUOTe><fonT SIZe="1">
<p clASS="footnote">
<Sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a></sup>
Some OOP
languages also define polymorphism to mean overloading functions
based on the type signatures of their arguments. Since there is no
type declaration in Python, the concept doesn't really apply,
but type-base selections can be always be coded using
<tt class="monofont">if</tt> tests and <Tt ClasS="monofont">type(X)</tT> built-in
functions (e.g., <Tt CLaSs="monofont">if type(X) is type(0):
doIntegerCase()</TT>).</P>
</Font></bLOCKquotE>









<H4>6.8.2
OOP and Inheritance: "is-a"</H4>


<P>We've talked about the mechanics of<a namE="idx545"></A> inheritance in depth already, but
we'd like to show you an example<A Name="idx546"></a> of how it can be used to model
real-world relationships. From a programmer's point of view,
inheritance is kicked off by attribute qualifications and searches
for a name in an instance, its class, and then its superclasses. From
a designer's point of view, inheritance is a way to specify set
membership. A class defines a set of properties that may be inherited
by more specific sets (i.e., subclasses).</p>



<p>To illustrate, let's put that pizza-making robot we talked
about at the start of the chapter to work. Suppose we've
decided to explore alternative career paths and open a pizza
restaurant. One of the first things we'll need to do is hire
employees to service customers, make the pizza, and so on. Being
engineers at heart, we've also decided to build a robot to make
the pizzas; but being politically and cybernetically correct,
we've also decided to make our robot a full-fledged employee,
with a salary.</p>



<p>Our pizza shop team can be defined by the following classes in the
example file <i>employees.py</i>. It defines four
classes and some self-test code. The most general class,
<tt class="monofont">Employee</tt>, provides common behavior such as bumping
up salaries (<tT cLass="monofont">giveRaise</Tt>) and printing (<TT cLAsS="monofont">
</tT>__<TT Class="monofont"> repr </TT>__<TT clasS="monofont"> </TT>). There
are two kinds of employees, and so two subclasses of
<Tt claSS="monofont">Employee--Chef</TT> and <tt class="monofont">Server</tt>. Both
override the inherited <tt class="monofont">work</tt> method to print more
specific messages. Finally, our pizza robot is modeled by an even
more specific class: <tt ClAss="monofont">PizzaRobot</tT> is a kind of
<tT ClASs="monofont">Chef</Tt>, which is a kind of
<TT CLass="monofont">Employee</tT>. In OOP terms, we call these
relationships "is-a" links: a robot is a chef, which is
a(n) employee.</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary=0):
        self.name   = name
        self.salary = salary
    def giveRaise(self, percent):
        self.salary = self.salary + (self.salary * percent)
    def work(self):
        print self.name, "does stuff"
    def __repr__(self):
        return "&lt;Employee: name=%s, salary=%s&gt;" % (self.name, self.salary)

class Chef(Employee):
    def __init__(self, name):
        Employee.__init__(self, name, 50000)
    def work(self):
        print self.name, "makes food"

class Server(Employee):
    def __init__(self, name):
        Employee.__init__(self, name, 40000)
    def work(self):
        print self.name, "interfaces with customer"

class PizzaRobot(Chef):
    def __init__(self, name):
        Chef.__init__(self, name)
    def work(self):
        print self.name, "makes pizza"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bob = PizzaRobot('bob')       # make a robot named bob
    print bob                     # runs inherited __repr__
    bob.giveRaise(0.20)           # give bob a 20% raise
    print bob; print

    for klass in Employee, Chef, Server, PizzaRobot:
        obj = klass(klass.__name__)
        obj.work()</PRe>


<p>When we run this module's self-test code, we create a
pizza-making robot named <tt CLASs="monofont">bob</tt>, which inherits names
from three classes: <tt class="monofont">PizzaRobot</tt>,
<tt class="monofont">Chef</tT>, and <tT claSs="monofont">Employee</TT>. For
instance, printing <tT ClAsS="monofont">bob</TT> runs the <Tt claSS="monofont">Employee.
</TT>__<tt clASS="monofont"> repr </Tt>__<tt cLASS="monofont"> </tt> method,
and giving <tt class="monofont">bob</tt> a raise invokes
<tt class="monofont">Employee.giveRaise</tt>, because that's where
inheritance finds it.</P>



<pRe clAsS="monofont">C:\python\examples&gt; <B>python employees.py</b>
&lt;Employee: name=bob, salary=50000&gt;
&lt;Employee: name=bob, salary=60000.0&gt;

Employee does stuff
Chef makes food
Server interfaces with customer
PizzaRobot makes pizza</PRe>


<P>In a class hierarchy like this, you can usually make instances of any
of the classes, not just the ones at the bottom. For instance, the
<tT CLAss="monofont">for</tt> loop in this module's self-test code
creates instances of all four classes; each responds differently when
asked to work, because the <TT CLass="monofont">work</tT> method is
different in each. Really, these classes just simulate real world
objects; <TT Class="monofont">work</TT> prints a message for the time being,
but could be expanded to really work later.</P>







<H4>6.8.3
OOP and Composition: "has-a"</h4>


<p>We introduced the notion of<a name="idx547"></a> <a name="idx548"></a>
<a name="idx549"></a>
composition at the start of this chapter. From a programmer's
point of view, composition involves embedding other objects in a
container object and activating them to implement container methods.
To a designer, composition is another way to represent relationships
in a problem domain. But rather than set membership, composition has
to do with components—parts of a whole. Composition also
reflects the relationships between parts; it's usually called a
"has-a" relationship, when OOP people speak of such
things.</P>



<p>Now that we've implemented our employees, let's throw
them in the pizza shop and let them get busy. Our pizza shop is a
composite object; it has an oven, and employees like servers and
chefs. When a customer enters and places an order, the components of
the shop spring into action—the server takes an order, the chef
makes the pizza, and so on. The following example simulates all the
objects and relationships in this scenario:</P>



<pre ClASs="monofont">from employees import PizzaRobot, Server

class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def order(self, server):
        print self.name, "orders from", server
    def pay(self, server):
        print self.name, "pays for item to", server

class Oven:
    def bake(self):
        print "oven bakes"

class PizzaShop:
    def __init__(self):
        self.server = Server('Pat')         # embed other objects
        self.chef   = PizzaRobot('Bob')     # a robot named bob
        self.oven   = Oven()

    def order(self, name):
        customer = Customer(name)           # activate other objects
        customer.order(self.server)         # customer orders from server
        self.chef.work()
        self.oven.bake()
        customer.pay(self.server)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    scene = PizzaShop()                     # make the composite
    scene.order('Homer')                    # simulate Homer's order
    print '...'
    scene.order('Shaggy')                   # simulate Shaggy's order</PRe>


<P>The <tT CLAss="monofont">PizzaShop</tt> class is a container and controller;
its constructor makes and embeds instances of the employee classes we
wrote in the last section, as well as an <TT CLass="monofont">Oven</tT>
class defined here. When this module's self-test code calls the
<TT Class="monofont">PizzaShop</TT> <TT class="monofont">order</tt> method, the
embedded objects are asked to carry out their actions in turn. Notice
that we make a new <tt class="monofont">Customer</tt> object for each order,
and pass on the embedded <tt clAsS="monofont">Server</tt> object to
<tT cLAsS="monofont">Customer</Tt> methods; customers come and go, but the
server is part of the pizza shop composite. Also notice that
employees are still involved in an inheritance relationship;
composition and inheritance are complementary tools:</P>



<pRE CLass="monofont">C:\python\examples&gt; <b>python pizzashop.py</B>
Homer orders from &lt;Employee: name=Pat, salary=40000&gt;
Bob makes pizza
oven bakes
Homer pays for item to &lt;Employee: name=Pat, salary=40000&gt;
...
Shaggy orders from &lt;Employee: name=Pat, salary=40000&gt;
Bob makes pizza
oven bakes
Shaggy pays for item to &lt;Employee: name=Pat, salary=40000&gt;</PRE>


<p>When we run this module, our pizza shop handles two orders—one
from Homer, and then one from Shaggy. Again, this is mostly just a
toy simulation; a real pizza shop would have more parts, and
there's no real pizza to be had here. But the objects and
interactions are representative of composites at work. As a rule of
thumb, classes can represent just about any objects and relationships
you can express in a sentence; just replace nouns with classes and
verbs with methods, and you have a first cut at <a naME="idx550"></A> <A name="idx551"></A> <A NAme="idx552"></a>a design.</p>



<p><table cellspacinG="0" wIdth="90%" BoRDeR="1"><Tr><Td>
<CENTer><h2>
Why You Will Care: Classes and Persistence</h2></CENTer>


<p>Besides allowing us to simulate real-world interactions, the pizza
shop classes could also be used as the basis of a
<a NAME="idx553"></a>
<a naME="idx554"></A>
<A name="idx555"></a>persistent restaurant database. As
we'll see in <a href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a>, instances of classes
can be stored away on disk in a single step using Python's
<tt class="monofont">pickle</tt>
<A nAme="idx556"></a>
<A nAMe="idx557"></A>
or <Tt ClASS="monofont">shelve</Tt>
<a naME="idx558"></A> modules. The object pickling interface
is remarkably easy to use:</P>


<pre cLASS="monofont">import pickle
object = someClass()
file   = open(filename, 'w')         # create external file
pickle.dump(object, file)            # save object in file

file   = open(filename, 'r')
object = pickle.load(file)           # fetch it back later</pre>

<p>Shelves are similar, but they automatically pickle objects to an
access-by-key database:</P>


<PRE class="monofont">import shelve
object = someClass()
dbase  = shelve.open('filename')
dbase['key'] = object                 # save under key
object = dbase['key']                 # fetch it back later</pre>

<p>(Pickling converts objects to serialized byte streams, which may be
stored in files, sent across a network, and so on.) In our example,
using classes to model employees means we can get a simple database
of employees and shops for free: pickling such instance objects to a
file makes them persistent across Python program executions. See
<a href="lpython_cnode103.html">Chapter 10</a> for more details on pickling.</p>

<H4>6.8.4
OOP and Delegation</h4>


<P>O<A nAMe="idx559"></A>bject-oriented
programmers often talk about something called
<a NAME="idx560"></a>delegation
too, which usually implies controller objects that embed other
objects, to which they pass off operation requests. The controllers
can take care of administrative activities such as keeping track of
accesses and so on. In Python, delegation is often implemented with
the <tt cLASS="monofont"> </tt>__<tt CLASs="monofont"> getattr </tt>__<tT CLAss="monofont">
</tt> method hook; because it intercepts accesses to nonexistent
attributes, a wrapper class can use <tt class="monofont"> </tt>__<tt class="monofont">
getattr </Tt>__<Tt clAsS="monofont"> </Tt> to route arbitrary accesses
to a wrapped object. For instance:</P>



<PrE cLASS="monofont">class wrapper:
    def __init__(self, object):
        self.wrapped = object                        # save object
    def __getattr__(self, attrname):
        print 'Trace:', attrname                     # trace fetch
        return getattr(self.wrapped, attrname)       # delegate fetch</pre>


<p>You can use this module's <TT CLass="monofont">wrapper</tT> class to
control any object with attributes—lists, dictionaries, and
even classes and instances. Here, the class simply prints a trace
message on each attribute access:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>from trace import wrapper</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>x = wrapper([1,2,3])            </b>  # wrap a list
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>x.append(4)                     </b>  # delegate to list method
Trace: append
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>x.wrapped                         </b># print my member
[1, 2, 3, 4]

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>x = wrapper({"a": 1, "b": 2})     </b># wrap a dictionary
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>x.keys()                         </b> # delegate to dictionary method
Trace: keys
['a', 'b']</pre>





<a name="8"></a>
<h4>6.8.5
Extending Built-in Object Types</H4>


<p>C<A namE="idx561"></a>lasses are also commonly used to
extend the functionality of Python's built-in types, to support
more exotic data structures. For instance, to add queue insert and
delete methods to lists, you can code classes that
<I>wrap</I> (embed) a list object, and export insert
and delete methods that process the list.</p>



<P>Remember those set functions we wrote in <A href="lpython_cnode42.html">Chapter 4</A>? Here's what they look like brought back
to life as a Python class. The following example implements a new set
<I>object</I>
<a namE="idx562"></A>
type, by moving some of the set functions we saw earlier in the book
to methods, and adding some basic operator overloading. For the most
part, this class just wraps a Python list with extra set operations,
but because it's a class, it also supports multiple instances
and customization by inheritance in subclasses.</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">class Set:
   def __init__(self, value = []):    # constructor
       self.data = []                 # manages a list
       self.concat(value)

   def intersect(self, other):        # other is any sequence
       res = []                       # self is the subject
       for x in self.data:
           if x in other:             # pick common items
               res.append(x)
       return Set(res)                # return a new Set

   def union(self, other):            # other is any sequence
       res = self.data[:]             # copy of my list
       for x in other:                # add items in other
           if not x in res:
               res.append(x)
       return Set(res)

   def concat(self, value):           # value: list, Set...
       for x in value:                # removes duplicates
          if not x in self.data:
               self.data.append(x)

   def __len__(self):          return len(self.data)        # on len(self)
   def __getitem__(self, key): return self.data[key]        # on self[i]
   def __and__(self, other):   return self.intersect(other) # on self &amp; other
   def __or__(self, other):    return self.union(other)     # on self | other
   def __repr__(self):         return 'Set:' + `self.data`  # on print</Pre>


<p>By overloading indexing, our set class can often masquerade as a real
list. Since we're going to ask you to interact with and extend
this class in an exercise at the end of this chapter, we won't
say much more about this code until <a href="lpython_cnode130.html">Appendix C</a>.</p>







<h4>6.8.6
Multiple Inheritance</h4>


<p>When we discussed details of the <tt class="monofont">class</tt> statement,
we mentioned that more than one superclass can be listed in
parentheses in the header line. When you do this, you use something
called<a name="idx563"></a>
<I>multiple inheritance; </i>the class and its
instances inherit names from all listed superclasses. When searching
for an attribute, Python searches superclasses in the class header
from left to right until a match is found. Technically, the search
proceeds depth-first, and then left to right, since any of the
superclasses may have superclasses of its own.</P>



<p>In theory, multiple inheritance is good for modeling objects which
belong to more than one set. For instance, a person may be an
engineer, a writer, a musician, and so on, and inherit properties
from all such sets. In practice, though, multiple inheritance is an
advanced tool and can become complicated if used too much;
we'll revisit this as a gotcha at the end of the chapter. But
like everything else in programming, it's a useful tool when
applied well.</p>



<p>One of the most common ways multiple inheritance is used is to
"mix in" general-purpose methods from superclasses. Such
superclasses are usually called <I>mixin</i> classes;
they provide methods you add to application classes by inheritance.
For instance, Python's default way to print a class instance
object isn't incredibly useful:</P>



<PrE ClAsS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>class Spam:</B>
...     <B>def __init__(self):</b>               # no __repr__
...         <b>self.data1 = "food"</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>X = Spam()</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>print X</B>                               # default format: class, address
&lt;Spam instance at 87f1b0&gt;</Pre>


<p>As seen in the previous section on operator overloading, you can
provide a <tT CLAss="monofont"> </tt>__<TT CLass="monofont"> repr </tt>_
_<tt class="monofont"> </tt> method to implement a custom string
representation of your own. But rather than code a <tt clasS="monofont">
</tT>__<tt cLaSS="monofont"> repr </tT>__<Tt ClASS="monofont"> </Tt> in each
and every class you wish to print, why not code it once in a
general-purpose tool class, and inherit it in all classes?</p>



<p>That's what<a NAME="idx564"></a>
<a naME="idx565"></A> mixins are
for. The following code defines a mixin class called
<Tt claSS="monofont">Lister</TT> that overloads the <tt class="monofont"> </tt>_
_<tt class="monofont"> repr </tt>__<tt ClAss="monofont"> </tT> method for each
class that includes <tT ClASs="monofont">Lister</Tt> in its header line. It
simply scans the instance's attribute dictionary (remember,
it's exported in <TT CLass="monofont"> </tT>__<TT Class="monofont"> dict
</TT>__<TT clasS="monofont"> </TT>) to build up a string showing the
names and values of all instance attributes. Since classes are
objects, <Tt class="monofont">Lister</tt>'s formatting logic can be
used for instances of any subclass; it's a generic tool.</p>



<p><tt class="monofont">Lister</tt> uses two special tricks to extract the
instance's classname and address. Instances have a built-in
<tT cLass="monofont"> </Tt>__<TT cLAsS="monofont"> class </tT>__<TT Class="monofont">
</TT> attribute that references the class the instance was
created from, and classes have a <TT clasS="monofont"> </TT>__<Tt claSS="monofont">

instance's memory address by calling the built-in
<TT clasS="monofont">id</TT> function, which returns any object's
address:</P>



<pre class="monofont"># Lister can be mixed-in to any class, to
# provide a formatted print of instances
# via inheritance of __repr__ coded here;
# self is the instance of the lowest class;

class Lister:
   def __repr__(self):
       return ("&lt;Instance of %s, address %s:\n%s&gt;" %
                         (self.__class__.__name__,      # my class's name
                          id(self),                     # my address
                          self.attrnames()) )           # name=value list
   def attrnames(self):
       result = ''
       for attr in self.__dict__.keys():      # scan instance namespace dict
           if attr[:2] == '__':
               result = result + "\tname %s=&lt;built-in&gt;\n" % attr
           else:
               result = result + "\tname %s=%s\n" % (attr, self.__dict__[attr])
       return result</pre>


<p>Now, the <tt class="monofont">Lister</tT> class is useful for any class you
write—even classes that already have a superclass. This is
where multiple inheritance comes in handy: by adding
<tT claSs="monofont">Lister</TT> to the list of superclasses in a class
header, you get its <tT ClAsS="monofont"> </TT>__<Tt claSS="monofont"> repr </TT>_
_<tt clASS="monofont"> </Tt> for free, while still inheriting from the
existing superclass:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">from mytools import Lister            # get tool class

class Super:
    def __init__(self):               # superclass __init__
        self.data1 = "spam"

class Sub(Super, Lister):             # mix-in a __repr__
    def __init__(self):               # Lister has access to self
        Super.__init__(self)
        self.data2 = "eggs"           # more instance attrs
        self.data3 = 42

if __name__ == "__main__":
    X = Sub()
    print X                           # mixed-in repr</pre>


<p>Here, <tt class="monofont">Sub</tt> inherits names from both
<tt claSs="monofont">Super</Tt> and <tt ClASs="monofont">Lister</TT>; it's a
composite of its own names and names in both its superclasses. When
you make a <tT cLASS="monofont">Sub</tt> instance and print it, you get the
custom representation mixed in from <tt CLASs="monofont">Lister</tt>:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">C:\python\examples&gt; <B>python testmixin.py</B>
&lt;Instance of Sub, address 7833392:
        name data3=42
        name data2=eggs
        name data1=spam
&gt;</PRe>


<p><tt class="monofont">Lister</tt> works in any class it's mixed into,
because <tt class="monofont">self</tt> refers to an instance of the subclass
that pulls <Tt ClasS="monofont">Lister</tT> in, whatever that may be. If you
later decide to extend <Tt CLaSs="monofont">Lister</TT>'s <TT clasS="monofont">
</TT>__<Tt claSS="monofont"> repr </TT>__<tt clASS="monofont"> </Tt> to also
print class attributes an instance inherits, you're safe;
because it's an inherited method, changing
<tt class="monofont">Lister</tt>'s <tt class="monofont"> </tt>__<tT cLass="monofont">
repr </Tt>__<TT cLAsS="monofont"> </tT> updates each subclass that
mixes it in.<FONt sizE="1"><SUP><a hreF="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</A></SUp></fonT>
 In some
sense, mixin classes are the class equivalent of modules. Here is
<TT Class="monofont">Lister</tt> working in single-inheritance mode, on a
different class's instances; like we said, OOP is about code
reuse:</p>


<blockquote><fonT sIze="1">
<p ClASs="footnote">
<SUp><A nAME="FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</A></sup>
For the curious reader, classes also
have a built-in attribute called __<tT CLAss="monofont">bases</tt>__ ,
which is a tuple of the class's superclass objects. A
general-purpose class hierarchy lister or browser can traverse from
an instance's __<TT CLass="monofont">class</tT>__ to its class, and
then from the class's __<TT Class="monofont">bases</tt>__ to all
superclasses recursively. We'll revisit this idea in an
exercise, but see other books or Python's manuals for more
details on special object attributes.</p>

<H4>6.8.7
Classes Are Objects: Generic Object Factories</H4>


<p>Because <a name="idx569"></a>
<a name="idx570"></a>
<a name="idx571"></a>classes
are objects, it's easy to pass them around a program, store
them in data structures, and so on. You can also pass classes to
functions that generate arbitrary kinds of
<a NaMe="idx572"></a>objects;
such functions are sometimes called <i>factories</I> in
OOP design circles. They are a major undertaking in a strongly typed
language such as C++, but almost trivial in Python: the
<tT ClASs="monofont">apply</Tt> function we met in <A href="lpython_cnode42.html">Chapter 4</a> can call any class with any argument in one
step, to generate any sort of instance:<foNT SIze="1"><suP><A HRef="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></sUP></FOnt>
</p>


<blockquote><font sizE="1">
<p ClasS="footnote">
<sUP><a NAmE="FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></SUP>
Actually,
<Tt claSS="monofont">apply</TT> can call <i>any</i> callable
object; that includes functions, classes, and methods. The
<tt CLASs="monofont">factory</tt> function here can run any callable, not
just a class (despite the argument name).</p>
</FONT></blockquote>





<pre class="monofont">def factory(aClass, *args):                 # varargs tuple
    return apply(aClass, args)              # call aClass

class Spam:
    def doit(self, message):
        print message

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, job):
        self.name = name
        self.job  = job

object1 = factory(Spam)                      # make a Spam
object2 = factory(Person, "Guido", "guru")   # make a Person</prE>


<p>In this code, we define an object generator function, called
<Tt clAsS="monofont">factory</Tt>. It expects to be passed a class object
(any class will do), along with one or more arguments for the
class's constructor. The function uses <TT cLaSS="monofont">apply</TT>
to call the function and return an instance. The rest of the example
simply defines two classes and generates instances of both by passing
them to the <tt clASS="monofont">factory</Tt> function. And that's the
only <tt cLASS="monofont">factory</tt> function you ever need write in
Python; it works for any class and any constructor arguments. The
only possible improvement worth noting: to support keyword arguments
in constructor calls, the factory can collect them with a
<tt CLASs="monofont">**args</tt> argument and pass them as a third argument
to <tt class="monofont">apply</tt>:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">def factory(aClass, *args, **kwargs):        # +kwargs dict
    return apply(aClass, args, kwargs)       # call aClass</pRe>


<p>By now, you should know that everything is an "object" in
Python; even things like classes, which are just compiler input in
languages like C++. However, only objects derived from classes are
OOP objects in Python; you can't do inheritance with
nonclass-based objects such as lists and numbers, unless you wrap
them in classes.</p>







<H4>6.8.8
Methods Are Objects: Bound or Unbound</h4>


<P>Speaking of<A nAMe="idx573"></A>
<a NAME="idx574"></a> objects, it turns out that methods
are a kind of object too, much like functions. Because class methods
can be accessed from either an instance or a class, they actually
come in two flavors in Python:</p>



<a nAME="idx575"></A><a namE="idx576"></A><DL>
<dt>
<foNT COlor="#990000">U<a name="idx575"></a>nbound class methods: no self</font></dt>
<dd>
<p>Accessing a class's function attribute by qualifying a class
returns an <i>unbound method object</i>. To call it,
you must provide an instance object explicitly as its first argument.</P>
</dD>
<dt>
<fOnT CoLOr="#990000">B<A nAME="idx576"></A>ound instance methods: self + function pairs</font></DT>
<DD>
<p>Accessing a class's function attribute by qualifying an
instance returns a <i>bound method object</i>. Python
automatically packages the instance with the function in the bound
method object, so we don't need to pass an instance to call the
method.</p>
</DD>
</DL>


<p>Both kinds of methods are full-fledged objects; they can be passed
around, stored in lists, and so on. Both also require an instance in
their first argument when run (i.e., a value for
<tt cLASS="monofont">self</tt>), but Python provides one for you
automatically when calling a bound method through an instance. For
example, suppose we define the following class:</p>



<pre class="monofont">class Spam:
    def doit(self, message):
        print message</pre>


<p>Now, we can make an instance, and fetch a bound method without
actually calling it. An <tt claSs="monofont">object.name</Tt> qualification
is an object expression; here, it returns a bound method object that
packages the instance (<tt ClASs="monofont">object1</TT>) with the method
function (<tT cLASS="monofont">Spam.doit</tt>). We can assign the bound
method to another name and call it as though it were a simple
function:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">object1 = Spam()
x = object1.doit        # bound method object
x('hello world')        # instance is implied</pRE>


<P>On the other hand, if we qualify the class to get to
<Tt claSS="monofont">doit</TT>, we get back an unbound method object, which
is simply a reference to the function object. To call this type of
method, pass in an instance in the leftmost argument:</p>



<pre class="monofont">t = Spam.doit           # unbound method object
t(object1, 'howdy')     # pass in instance</pre>


<p>Most of the time, you call methods immediately after fetching them
with qualification (e.g., <tt class="monofont">self.attr(args)</Tt>), so you
don't always notice the method object along the way. But if you
start writing code that calls objects generically, you need to be
careful to treat unbound methods specially; they require an explicit
object.</P>
