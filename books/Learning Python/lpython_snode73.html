<h3>6.9
Odds and Ends</h3>



<h4>6.9.1
Private Attributes (New in 1.5)</h4>


<P>In the last chapter, we noted that every name assigned at the top
level of a file is exported by a module. By default, the same holds
for classes; data hiding is a convention, and clients may fetch or
change any class or instance attribute they like. In fact, attributes
are all <TT Class="monofont">public</TT> and <TT clasS="monofont">virtual</TT> in
C++ terms; they're all accessible everywhere and all looked up
dynamically at runtime.</P>



<p>At least until Python 1.5. In 1.5, Guido introduced the notion
of<a name="idx577"></a>
<i>name mangling</i> to localize some names in
<a name="idx578"></a>classes. Private names are an
advanced feature, entirely optional, and probably won't be very
useful until you start writing large class hierarchies. But
here's an overview for the curious.</p>



<p>In Python 1.5, names inside a <tt cLaSs="monofont">class</tt> statement that
start with two underscores (and don't end with two underscores)
are automatically changed to include the name of the enclosing class.
For instance, a name like <Tt CLaSS="monofont"> </tT>__<tT CLAss="monofont">
X</tt> in a class <TT CLass="monofont">Class</tT> is changed to
<TT Class="monofont">_Class </TT>__<TT class="monofont"> X</tt> automatically.
Because the modified name includes the name of the enclosing class,
it's somewhat unusual; it won't clash with similar names
in other classes in a hierarchy.</p>



<p>Python mangles names wherever they appear in the class. For example,
an instance attribute called <tt class="monofont">self. </tt>__<tt ClAss="monofont">
X</tT> is transformed to <tT ClASs="monofont">self._Class </Tt>_
_<TT CLass="monofont"> X</tT>, thereby mangling an attribute name for
<I>instance</I> objects too. Since more than one class
may add attributes to an instance, name mangling helps avoid clashes
automatically.</P>



<p>Name mangling happens only in <tt cLASS="monofont">class</tt> statements and
only for names you write with two leading underscores. Because of
that, it can make code somewhat unreadable. It also isn't quite
the same as <tt CLASs="monofont">private</tt> declarations in C++ (if you
know the name of the enclosing class, you can still get to mangled
attributes!), but it can avoid accidental name clashes when an
attribute name is used by more than one class of a hierarchy.</p>







<h4>6.9.2
Documentation Strings</h4>


<p>Now that we know about
<a name="idx579"></a> <a name="idx580"></a>
<a NaMe="idx581"></a>classes, we can tell what those
<tT cLAsS="monofont"> </Tt>__<Tt CLASs="monofont"> doc </tt>__<tT CLAss="monofont">
</tt> attributes we've seen are all about. So far
we've been using comments that start with a
<TT CLass="monofont">#</tT> to describe our code. Comments are useful for
humans reading our programs, but they aren't available when the
program runs. Python also lets us associate
<I>strings</I> of documentation with program-unit
objects and provides a special syntax for it. If a module file,
<Tt class="monofont">def</tt> statement, or <tt class="monofont">class</tt>
statement begins with a string constant instead of a statement,
Python stuffs the string into the <tt cLaSs="monofont"> </tt>__<Tt CLaSS="monofont">
doc </tT>__<tT CLAss="monofont"> </tt> attribute of the generated
object. For instance, the following program defines documentation
strings for multiple objects:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">"I am: docstr.__doc__"

class spam:
    "I am: spam.__doc__ or docstr.spam.__doc__"

    def method(self, arg):
        "I am: spam.method.__doc__ or self.method.__doc__"
        pass

def func(args):
    "I am: docstr.func.__doc__"
    pass</PRE>


<p>The main advantage of documentation strings is that they stick around
at runtime; if it's been coded as a documentation string, you
can qualify an object to fetch its documentation.</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import docstr</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>docstr.</b>__<b>doc</b>__
'I am: docstr.__doc__'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>docstr.spam.</b>__<b>doc</b>__
'I am: spam.__doc__ or docstr.spam.__doc__'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>docstr.spam.method.</b>__<b>doc</b>__
'I am: spam.method.__doc__ or self.method.__doc__'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>docstr.func.</b>__<b>doc</b>__
'I am: docstr.func.__doc__'</PrE>


<p>This can be especially useful during development. For instance, you
can look up components' documentation at the interactive
command line as done above, without having to go to the source file
to see # comments. Similarly, a Python object browser can take
advantage of documentation strings to display descriptions along with
objects.</p>



<p>On the other hand, documentation strings are not universally used by
Python programmers. To get the most benefit from them, programmers
need to follow some sort of conventions in their documentation
styles, and it's our experience that these sorts of conventions
are rarely implemented or followed in practice. Further,
documentation strings are available at runtime, but they are also
less flexible than # comments (which can appear anywhere in a
program). Both forms are useful tools, and <I>any</i>
program documentation is a good thing, as long as it's
accurate.</P>

C
lasses Versus Modules</h4>


<p>Finally, let's step back for a moment and compare the topics of
the last two chapters—modules and classes. Since they're
both about namespaces, the distinction can sometimes be confusing. In
short:</P>



<DL>
<Dt>
<i><foNT COlor="#990000">Modules</fONT></I></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><p>	Are data/logic packages</p>
</li>
<li><p>	Are created by writing Python files or C extensions</p>
</li>
<li><P>	Are used by being imported</p>
</Li>
</ul></Dd>
<DT>
<i><FOnT cOLOR="#990000">Classes</font></I></DT>
<Dd>
<ul>
<lI><P>	Implement new objects</P>
</Li>
<li><p>	Are created by class statements</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>	Are used by being called</p>
</li>
<li><p>	Always live in a module</p>
</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>


<p>Classes also support extra features modules don't, such as
operator overloading, multiple instances, and inheritance. Although
both are namespaces, we hope you can tell by now that they're
very different animals.</p>
