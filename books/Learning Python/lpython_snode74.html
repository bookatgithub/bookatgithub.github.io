<h3>6.10
Class Gotchas</h3>


<p>Most class issues can usually be boiled down to namespace issues
(which makes sense, given that classes are just namespaces with a few
extra tricks up their sleeves).</p>




<A NAMe="idx642"></a><h4>6.10.1
Changing Class Attributes Can Have Side Effects</h4>


<P>Theoretically speaking, <A NAme="idx582"></a>classes (and class instances) are
all mutable objects. Just as with built-in lists and dictionaries,
they can be changed in place, by assigning to their attributes. As
with lists and dictionaries, this also means that changing a class or
instance object may impact multiple references to it.</p>



<P>That's usually what we want (and is how objects change their
state in general), but this becomes especially critical to know when
changing class attributes. Because all instances generated from a
class share the class's namespace, any changes at the class
level are reflected in all instances, unless they have their own
versions of changed class attributes.</P>



<P>Since classes, modules, and instances are all just objects with
attribute namespaces, you can normally change their attributes at
runtime by assignments. Consider the following class; inside the
class body, the assignment to name <Tt class="monofont">a</tt> generates an
attribute <tt class="monofont">X.a</tt>, which lives in the class object at
runtime and will be inherited by all of <tt cLaSs="monofont">X</tt>'s
instances:</P>



<pRE cLAsS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> class X:</B>
...<B>     a = 1       </B> # class attribute
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> I = X()</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> I.a              </b># inherited by instance
1
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> X.a</B>
1</PRE>


<p>So far so good. But notice what happens when we change the class
attribute dynamically: it also changes it in every object which
inherits from the class. Moreover, new instances created from the
class get the dynamically set value, regardless of what the
class's source code says:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> X.a = 2          </b># may change more than X
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> I.a              </B># I changes too
2
&gt;&gt;&gt;<B> J = X()          </B># J inherits from X's runtime values
&gt;&gt;&gt;<b> J.a             </b> # (but assigning to J.a changes a in J, not X or I)
2</pre>



<h5>6.10.1.1
Solution</h5>


<p>Useful feature or dangerous trap? You be the judge, but you can
actually get work done by changing class attributes, without ever
making a single instance. In fact, this technique can simulate
"records" or "structs" in other languages.
For example, consider the following unusual but legal Python program:</p>



<pre class="monofont">class X: pass                          # make a few attribute namespaces
class Y: pass

X.a = 1                                # use class attributes as variables
X.b = 2                                # no instances anywhere to be found
X.c = 3
Y.a = X.a + X.b + X.c

for X.i in range(Y.a): print X.i       # prints 0..5</pre>


<P>Here, classes <tT claSs="monofont">X</TT> and <tT ClAsS="monofont">Y</TT> work like
file-less modules—namespaces for storing variables we
don't want to clash. This is a perfectly legal Python
programming trick, but is less appropriate when applied to classes
written by others; you can't always be sure that class
attributes you change aren't critical to the class's
internal behavior. If you're out to simulate a C struct, you
may be better off changing instances than classes, since only one
object is affected:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>class Record: pass</b>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>X = Record()</b>
<A NAMe="idx583"></a>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>X.name = 'bob'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>X.job  = 'Pizza maker'</B></PRe>







<h4>6.10.2
Multiple Inheritance: Order Matters</h4>


<p>This may be obvious, but is worth underscoring: if you
use<a name="idx584"></a>
<a name="idx585"></a>
multiple inheritance, the order in which superclasses are listed in a
<tt clAsS="monofont">class</tt> statement header can be critical. For
instance, in the example we saw earlier, suppose that the
<tT cLAsS="monofont">Super</Tt> implemented a <Tt CLASs="monofont"> </tt>_
_<tT CLAss="monofont"> repr </tt>__<TT CLass="monofont"> </tT> method too; would
we then want to inherit <TT Class="monofont">Lister</tt>'s or
<tt class="monofont">Super</tt>'s? We would get it from whichever
class is listed first in <tt claSs="monofont">Sub</Tt>'s class header,
since inheritance searches left to right. But now suppose
<tt ClASs="monofont">Super</TT> and <tT cLASS="monofont">Lister</tt> have their own
versions of other names too; if we want one name from
<tt CLASs="monofont">Super</tt> and one from <tT CLAss="monofont">Lister</tt>, we
have to override inheritance by manually assigning to the attribute
name in the <TT CLass="monofont">Sub</tt> class:</p>



<pre class="monofont">def __repr__(self): ...
    def other(self): ...

    def __repr__(self): ...
    def other(self): ...

class Sub(Super, Lister):  # pick up Super's __repr__, by listing it first
    other = Lister.other   # but explicitly pick up Lister's version of other  
    def __init__(self): 
        ...</pre>



<h5>6.10.2.1
Solution</h5>


<p>Multiple inheritance is an advanced tool; even if you understood the
last paragraph, it's still a good idea to use it sparingly and
carefully. Otherwise, the meaning of a name may depend on the order
in which classes are mixed in an arbitrarily far removed subclass.</P>








<h4>6.10.3
Class Function Attributes Are Special</H4>


<p>This one is<a nAmE="idx586"></A> simple if you understand
Python's underlying object model, but it tends to trip up new
users with backgrounds in other OOP languages (especially Smalltalk).
In Python, class method functions can never be called without an
instance. Earlier in the chapter, we talked about unbound methods:
when we fetch a method function by qualifying a class (instead of an
instance), we get an unbound method. Even though they are defined
with a <tT ClAsS="monofont">def</TT> statement, unbound method objects are
not simple functions; they cannot be called without an instance.</P>



<p>For example, suppose we want to use class attributes to count how
many instances are generated from a class. Remember, class attributes
are shared by all instances, so we can store the counter in the class
object itself:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">class Spam:
    numInstances = 0
    def __init__(self):
        Spam.numInstances = Spam.numInstances + 1
    def printNumInstances():
        print "Number of instances created: ", Spam.numInstances</prE>


<P>This won't work: the <TT clasS="monofont">printNumInstances</TT>
method still expects an instance to be passed in when called, because
the function is associated with a class (even though there are no
arguments in the <Tt class="monofont">def</tt> header):</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>from spam import *</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>a = Spam()</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>b = Spam()</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>c = Spam()</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Spam.printNumInstances()</B>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
TypeError: unbound method must be called with class instance 1st argument</pRE>



<h5>6.10.3.1
Solution</H5>


<P>Don't expect this: unbound methods aren't exactly the
same as simple functions. This is really a knowledge issue, but if
you want to call functions that access class members without an
instance, just make them simple functions, not class methods. This
way, an instance isn't expected in the call:</p>



<PrE CLAss="monofont">def printNumInstances():
    print "Number of instances created: ", Spam.numInstances

class Spam:
    numInstances = 0
    def __init__(self):
        Spam.numInstances = Spam.numInstances + 1

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import spam</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>a = spam.Spam()</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>b = spam.Spam()</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>c = spam.Spam()</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>spam.printNumInstances()</b>
Number of instances created:  3</PRE>


<P>We can also make this work by calling through an instance, as usual:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">class Spam:
    numInstances = 0
    def __init__(self):
        Spam.numInstances = Spam.numInstances + 1
    def printNumInstances(self):
        print "Number of instances created: ", Spam.numInstances

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>from spam import Spam</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>a, b, c = Spam(), Spam(), Spam()</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>a.printNumInstances()</b>
Number of instances created:  3
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>b.printNumInstances()</b>
Number of instances created:  3
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Spam().printNumInstances()</b>
Number of instances created:  4</pre>


<p>Some language theorists claim that this means Python doesn't
have class methods, only instance methods. We suspect they really
mean Python classes don't work the same as in some other
language. Python really has bound and unbound method objects, with
well-defined semantics; qualifying a class gets you an unbound
method, which is a special kind of function. Python really does have
class attributes, but functions in classes expect an instance
argument.</p>



<p>Moreover, since Python already provides <i>modules</i>
as a namespace partitioning tool, there's usually no need to
package functions in classes unless they implement object behavior.
Simple functions in modules usually do most of what instance-less
class methods could. For example, in the first example in this
section, <tT cLass="monofont">printNumInstances</Tt> is already associated
with the class, because it lives in the same module.</P>








<H4>6.10.4
Methods, Classes, and Nested Scopes</h4>


<P>Classes introduce a local <A nAmE="idx587"></A>scope just as functions do, so the same
sorts of scope gotchas can happen in a <TT clasS="monofont">class</TT>
statement body. Moreover, methods are further nested functions, so
the same issues apply. Confusion seems to be especially common when
classes are nested. For instance, in the following example, the
<Tt claSS="monofont">generate</TT> function is supposed to return an
instance of the nested <tt clASS="monofont">Spam</Tt> class. Within its
code, the class name <tt class="monofont">Spam</tt> is assigned in the
<tt class="monofont">generate</tt> function's local scope. But within
the class's <tT cLass="monofont">method</Tt> function, the class name
<TT cLAsS="monofont">Spam</tT> is not visible; <TT Class="monofont">method</TT> has
access only to its own local scope, the module surrounding
<TT clasS="monofont">generate</TT>, and built-in names:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">def generate():
    class Spam:
        count = 1
        def method(self):        # name Spam not visible:
            print Spam.count     # not local (def), global (module), built-in
    return Spam()

generate().method()

C:\python\examples&gt; <b>python nester.py</b>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "nester.py", line 8, in ?
    generate().method()
  File "nester.py", line 5, in method
    print Spam.count             # not local (def), global (module), built-in
NameError: Spam</pre>



<h5>6.10.4.1
Solution</h5>


<p>The most general piece of advice we can pass along here is to
remember the LGB rule; it works in classes and method functions just
as it does in simple functions. For instance, inside a method
function, code has unqualified access only to local names (in the
method <tt class="monofont">def</tt>), global names (in the enclosing
module), and built-ins. Notably missing is the enclosing
<tt cLaSs="monofont">class</tt> statement; to get to class attributes,
methods need to qualify <Tt CLaSS="monofont">self</tT>, the instance. To
call one method from another, the caller must route the call through
<tT CLAss="monofont">self</tt> (e.g., <TT CLass="monofont">self.method()</tT>).</P>



<P>There are a variety of ways to get the example above to work. One of
the simplest is to move the name <Tt claSS="monofont">Spam</TT> out to the
enclosing module's scope with global declarations; since
<tt class="monofont">method</tt> sees names in the enclosing module by the
LGB rule, <tt class="monofont">Spam</tt> references work:</p>



<pRe ClasS="monofont">def generate():
    global Spam                 # force Spam to module scope
    class Spam:
        count = 1
        def method(self):
            print Spam.count    # works: in global (enclosing module)
    return Spam()

generate().method()             # prints 1</pRE>


<p>Perhaps better, we can also restructure the example such that class
<TT cLaSS="monofont">Spam</TT> is defined at the top level of the module by
virtue of its nesting level, rather than <tt clASS="monofont">global</Tt>
declarations. Both the nested <tt cLASS="monofont">method</tt> function and
the top-level <tt CLASs="monofont">generate</tt> find
<tt class="monofont">Spam</tt> in their global scopes:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">def generate():
    return Spam()

class Spam:                    # define at module top-level
    count = 1
    def method(self):
        print Spam.count       # works: in global (enclosing module)

generate().method()</pRe>


<p>We can also get rid of the <tT cLAsS="monofont">Spam</Tt> reference in
<Tt CLASs="monofont">method</tt> altogether, by using the special <tT CLAss="monofont">
</tt>__<TT CLass="monofont"> class </tT>__<TT Class="monofont"> </tt>
attribute, which, as we've seen, returns an instance's
class object:</p>



<pre class="monofont">def generate():
    class Spam:
        count = 1
        def method(self):
            print self.__class__.count       # works: qualify to get class
    return Spam()

generate().method()</pre>


<p>Finally, we could use the <i>mutable default
</I> argument trick we saw in <a href="lpython_cnode42.html">Chapter 4</A> to
make this work, but it's so complicated we're almost
embarrassed to show you; the prior solutions usually make more sense:</p>



<PRe CLaSs="monofont">def generate():
    class Spam:
        count = 1
        fillin = [None]
        def method(self, klass=fillin):     # save from enclosing scope
            print klass[0].count            # works: default plugged-in
    Spam.fillin[0] = Spam
    return Spam()

generate().method()</PRE>


<P>Notice that we can't say <tt clASS="monofont">klass=Spam</Tt> in
<tt cLASS="monofont">method</tt>'s <tt CLASs="monofont">def</tt> header,
because the name <tt class="monofont">Spam</tt> isn't visible in
<tt class="monofont">Spam</tT>'s body either; it's not local (in
the class body), global (the enclosing module), or built-in.
<tT claSs="monofont">Spam</TT> only exists in the
<tT ClAsS="monofont">generate</TT> function's local scope, which
neither the nested class nor its<A name="idx588"></A> method can see. The LGB rule works the
same for<A NAme="idx589"></a>
both.</p>
