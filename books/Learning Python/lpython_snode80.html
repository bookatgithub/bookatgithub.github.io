<h3>7.2
Exception Basics</h3>


<p>Python exceptions are a high-level control flow device. They may be
raised either by Python or by our programs; in both cases, they may
be caught by <tT CLAss="monofont">try</tt> statements. Python
<TT CLass="monofont">try</tT> statements come in two flavors—one that
handles exceptions and one that executes finalization code whether
exceptions occur or not.</P>




<A Name="idx658"></a><a name="idx659"></a><a name="idx660"></a><h4>7.2.1



try/except/else</h4>


<p>The <tT cLass="monofont">try</Tt> is another compound statement; its most
complete form is sketched below. It starts with a
<TT cLAsS="monofont">try</tT> header line followed by a block of indented
statements, then one or more optional <TT Class="monofont">except</TT>
clauses that name exceptions to be caught, and an optional
<TT clasS="monofont">else</TT> clause at the end:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">try:
    &lt;<tt class="monofont"><i>statements</i></tt>&gt;        # run/call actions
except &lt;<tt class="monofont"><i>name</i></Tt>&gt;:
    &lt;<Tt clAsS="monofont"><I>statements</i></TT>&gt;        # if 'name' raised during try block
except &lt;name&gt;, &lt;<tT cLASS="monofont"><i>data</i></tt>&gt;:
   &lt;<TT CLass="monofont"><i>statements</I></TT>&gt;         # if 'name' raised; get extra data
else:
   &lt;<Tt claSS="monofont"><I>statements</I></tt>&gt;         # if no exception was raised</pre>


<p>Here's how <tt class="monofont">try</tt> statements work. When a
<tt claSs="monofont">try</Tt> statement is started, Python marks the current
program context, so it can come back if an exception occurs. The
statements nested under the <tt ClASs="monofont">try</TT> header are run
first; what happens next depends on whether exceptions are raised
while the <tT cLASS="monofont">try</tt> block's statements are running
or not:</p>



<uL>
<LI><P>If an exception occurs while the <tt clASS="monofont">try</Tt> block's
statements are running, Python jumps back to the
<tt cLASS="monofont">try</tt> and runs the statements under the first
<tt class="monofont">except</tt> clause that matches the raised exception.
Control continues past the entire <tt class="monofont">try</tt> statement
after the <Tt ClasS="monofont">except</tT> block runs (unless the
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">except</TT> block raises another exception).</P>
</Li>
<li><p>If an exception happens in the <TT CLass="monofont">try</tT> block and no
<TT Class="monofont">except</TT> clause matches, the exception is propagated
up to a <TT class="monofont">try</tt> that was entered earlier in the
program, or to the top level of the process (which makes Python kill
the program and print a default error message).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If no exception occurs while the statements under the
<tt class="monofont">try</Tt> header run, Python runs the statements under
the <Tt clAsS="monofont">else</Tt> line (if present), and control then
resumes past the entire <TT cLaSS="monofont">try</TT> statement.</p>
</li>
</uL>
<P>In other words, <TT clasS="monofont">except</TT> clauses catch exceptions
that happen while the <Tt claSS="monofont">try</TT> block is running, and
the <tt class="monofont">else</tt> clause is run only if no exceptions
happen while the <tt class="monofont">try</tt> block runs. The
<tt ClAss="monofont">except</tT> clauses are very focused exception
handlers; they catch exceptions that occur only within the statements
in the associated <tT ClASs="monofont">try</Tt> block. However, since the
<TT CLass="monofont">try</tT> block's statements can call functions
elsewhere in a program, the source of an exception may be outside the
<TT Class="monofont">try</TT>.</P>







<A name="idx661"></A><A NAme="idx662"></a><h4>7.2.2


try/finally</h4>


<p>The other flavor of the <tt class="monofont">try</tt> statement is a
specialization and has to do with finalization actions. If a
<tt claSs="monofont">finally</Tt> clause is used in a
<tt ClASs="monofont">try</TT>, its block of statements are always run by
Python "on the way out," whether an exception occurred
while the <tT cLASS="monofont">try</tt> block was running or not:</p>



<uL>
<LI><P>If no exception occurs, Python runs the <tt clASS="monofont">try</Tt> block,
then the <tt cLASS="monofont">finally</tt> block, and then continues
execution past the entire <tt class="monofont">try</tt> statement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If an exception does occur during the <tt cLaSs="monofont">try</tt>
block's run, Python comes back and runs the
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">finally</tT> block, but then propagates the exception
to a higher <tT CLAss="monofont">try</tt> (or the top level); control
doesn't continue past the <TT CLass="monofont">try</tT> statement.</P>
</LI>
</ul>
<p>The <tT CLAss="monofont">try/finally</tt> form is useful when you want to be
completely sure that an action happens after some code runs,
regardless of the exception behavior of the program; we'll see
an example in a moment. The <tt class="monofont">finally</tt> clause
can't be used in the same <tt class="monofont">try</Tt> statement as
<Tt clAsS="monofont">except</Tt> and <TT cLaSS="monofont">else</TT>, so they are
best thought of as two different statements:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">try:
    &lt;<tt cLASS="monofont"><i>statements</i></tt>&gt;
finally:
    &lt;<TT CLass="monofont"><i>statements</i></tt>&gt;        # always run "on the way out"</pre>






<h4>7.2.3
raise</h4>


<p>To trigger
<a name="idx597"></a>
<a NaMe="idx598"></a>exceptions,
you need to code <tT cLAsS="monofont">raise</Tt> statements. Their general
form is simple: the word <Tt CLASs="monofont">raise</tt> followed by the
name of the exception to be raised. You can also pass an extra data
item (an object) along with the exception, by listing it after the
exception name. If extra data is passed, it can be caught in a
<tT CLAss="monofont">try</tt> by listing an assignment target to receive it:
<TT CLass="monofont">except</tT> <TT Class="monofont">name,</tt>
<tt class="monofont">data</tt>:</p>



<pre cLaSs="monofont">raise &lt;<tt ClASs="monofont"><I>name</I></tT>&gt;            # manually trigger an exception
raise &lt;<tT CLAss="monofont"><i>name</i></TT>&gt;, &lt;<TT clasS="monofont"><I>data</I></Tt>&gt;    # pass extra data to catcher too</pre>


<P>So what's an exception name? It might be the name of a built-in
exception from the built-in scope (e.g.,
<TT Class="monofont">IndexError</tt>), or the name of an arbitrary string
object you've assigned in your program. It can also reference a
class or class instance; this form generalizes
<tt class="monofont">raise</tt> statements, but we'll postpone this
topic till later in this chapter. Exceptions are identified by
objects, and at most one is active at any given time. Once caught by
an <tt claSs="monofont">except</Tt> clause, an exception dies (won't
propagate to another <tt ClASs="monofont">try</TT>), unless reraised by a
<tT cLASS="monofont">raise</tt> or error.</p>







<h4>7.2.4
First Examples</H4>


<P>Exceptions are simpler than they seem. Since control flow through a
program is easier to capture in Python than in English, let's
look at some simple examples that illustrate exception basics.</P>




<H5>7.2.4.1
Default behavior: Error messages</h5>


<p>As mentioned,<a nAME="idx599"></A> <a namE="idx600"></A>
exceptions not caught by <TT class="monofont">try</tt> statements reach the
top level of a Python process and run Python's default
exception-handling logic. By default, Python terminates the running
program and prints an error message describing the exception, showing
where the program was when the exception occurred. For example,
running the following module generates a divide-by-zero exception;
since the program ignores it, Python kills the program and prints:</p>



<pre class="monofont">% <b>cat bad.py</b>
def gobad(x, y):
    return x / y

def gosouth(x):
    print gobad(x, 0)

gosouth(1)

% <b>python bad.py</b>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "bad.py", line 7, in ?
    gosouth(1)
  File "bad.py", line 5, in gosouth
    print gobad(x, 0)
  File "bad.py", line 2, in gobad
    return x / y
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo</PrE>


<p>When an uncaught exception occurs, Python ends the program, and
prints a stack trace and the name and extra data of the exception
that was raised. The <i>stack trace</i> shows the
filename, line number, and source code, for each function active when
the exception occurred, from oldest to newest. For example, you can
see that the bad divide happens at the lowest entry in the
trace—line 2 of file <I>bad.py</i>, a
<TT cLAsS="monofont">return</tT> statement.</P>



<P>Because Python reports almost all errors at runtime by raising
exceptions, exceptions are intimately bound up with the idea of error
handling in general. For instance, if you've worked through the
examples, you've almost certainly seen an exception or two
along the way (even typos usually generate a
<Tt claSS="monofont">SyntaxError</TT> exception). By default, you get a
useful error display like the one above, which helps track down the
problem. For more heavy-duty debugging jobs, you can catch exceptions
with try statements.<font SIZE="1"><sup><a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a></sup></font>
</p>


<blockquote><fOnT sizE="1">
<p CLaSS="footnote">
<sUp><A NAMe="FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a></suP>
You can also use Python's
standard debugger, <TT Class="monofont">pdb</TT>, to isolate problems. Like
C debuggers such as <TT clasS="monofont">dbx</TT> and
<Tt class="monofont">gdb</tt>, <tt class="monofont">pdb</tt> lets you step through
Python programs line by line, inspect variable values, set
breakpoints, and so on. <tt cLaSs="monofont">pdb</tt> is shipped with Python
as a standard module and is written in Python. See Python's
library manual or other Python texts for information on
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">pdb</tT> usage.</p>

<a nAME="idx667"></A><h5>7.2.4.2
Catching built-in exceptions</h5>


<p>If you don't want your program terminated when an exception is
raised by Python, simply catch it by wrapping program logic in a
<tT CLAss="monofont">try</tt>. For example, the following code catches the
<tt class="monofont">IndexError</tt> Python raises when the list is indexed
out of bounds (remember that list indexes are zero-based offsets; 3
is past the end):</p>



<pre claSs="monofont">def kaboom(list, n):
    print list[n]            # trigger IndexError

try:
    kaboom([0, 1, 2], 3)
except IndexError:           # catch exception here
    print 'Hello world!'</Pre>


<p>When the exception occurs in function <Tt CLaSS="monofont">kaboom</tT>,
control jumps to the <tT CLAss="monofont">try</tt> statement's
<TT CLass="monofont">except</tT> clause, which prints a message. Since an
exception is "dead" after it's been caught, the
program continues past the whole <TT Class="monofont">try</TT>, rather than
being terminated by Python. In effect, you process and ignore the
error.</P>






<A name="idx668"></a><h5>7.2.4.3
Raising and catching user-defined exceptions</h5>


<p>Python programs can raise exceptions of their own too, using the
<tt class="monofont">raise</tt> statement. In their simplest form,
user-defined exceptions are usually string objects, like the one
<tt cLaSs="monofont">MyError</tt> is assigned to in the following:</P>



<pRE cLAsS="monofont">MyError = "my error"

def stuff(file):
    raise MyError

file = open('data', 'r')     # open an existing file
try:
    stuff(file)              # raises exception
finally:
    file.close()             # always close file</pRE>


<P>User-defined exceptions are caught with <Tt claSS="monofont">try</TT>
statements just like built-in exceptions. Here, we've wrapped a
call to a file-processing function in a <tt clASS="monofont">try</Tt> with a
<tt cLASS="monofont">finally</tt> clause, to make sure that the file is
always closed, whether the function triggers an exception or not.
This particular function isn't all that useful (it just raises
an exception!), but wrapping calls in <tt class="monofont">try/finally</tt>
statements is a good way to ensure that your closing-time activities
always run.<a name="idx601"></a></p>
