<h3>9.1
Data Structure Manipulations</h3>


<p>One <a NAME="idx732"></a>of Python's greatest features
is that it provides the list, tuple, and dictionary built-in types.
They are so flexible and easy to use that once you've grown
used to them, you'll find yourself reaching for them
automatically.</p>




<h4>9.1.1
Making Copies Inline</h4>


<P>Due to Python'<A NAme="idx733"></a>s reference management scheme, the
statement <tT CLAss="monofont">a = b</tt> doesn't make a copy of the
object referenced by <tt class="monofont">b</tt> ; instead, it makes a new
reference to that object. Sometimes a new copy of an object, not just
a shared reference, is needed. How to do this depends on the type of
the object in question. The simplest way to make copies of
<a name="idx734"></a>lists
and
<a NaMe="idx735"></a>tuples
is somewhat odd. If <tT cLAsS="monofont">myList</Tt> is a list, then to make
a copy of it, you can do:</P>



<pRE CLass="monofont">newList = myList[:]</pRE>


<P>which you can read as "slice from beginning to end,"
since you'll remember from <A href="lpython_cnode17.html">Chapter 2</A>, that
the default index for the start of a slice is the beginning of the
sequence (0), and the default index for the end of a slice is the end
of sequence. Since tuples support the same slicing operation as
lists, this same technique can also copy tuples. Dictionaries, on the
other hand, don't support slicing. To make a copy of a
<A NAme="idx736"></a>dictionary
<tT CLAss="monofont">myDict</tt>, you can use:</p>



<pre class="monofont">newDict = {}
for key in myDict.keys():
    newDict[key] = myDict[key]</pre>


<p>This is such a common task that a new method was added to the
dictionary object in Python 1.5, the <tt cLaSs="monofont">copy()
</tt>method, which performs this task. So the preceding code can
be replaced with the single statement:</P>



<pRE cLAsS="monofont">newDict = myDict.copy()</pRE>


<P>Another common dictionary operation is also now a standard dictionary
feature. If you have a dictionary <Tt claSS="monofont">oneDict</TT>, and
want to update it with the contents of a different dictionary
<tt clASS="monofont">otherDict</Tt>, simply type
<tt cLASS="monofont">oneDict.update(otherDict)</tt>. This is the equivalent
of:</p>



<pre class="monofont">for key in otherDict.keys():
    oneDict[key] = otherDict[key]</pre>


<p>If <tt claSs="monofont">oneDict</Tt> shared some keys with
<tt ClASs="monofont">otherDict</TT> before the <tT cLASS="monofont">update()</tt>
operation, the old values associated with the keys in
<tt CLASs="monofont">oneDict</tt> are obliterated by the update. This may be
what you want to do (it usually is, which is why this behavior was
chosen and why it was called "update"). If it
isn't, the right thing to do might be to complain (raise an
exception), as in:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">def mergeWithoutOverlap(oneDict, otherDict):
    newDict = oneDict.copy()
    for key in otherDict.keys():
        if key in oneDict.keys():
            raise ValueError, "the two dictionaries are sharing keys!"
        newDict[key] = otherDict[key]
    return newDict</PRE>


<P>or, alternatively, combine the values of the two dictionaries, with a
tuple, for example:</p>



<pre class="monofont">def mergeWithOverlap(oneDict, otherDict):
    newDict = oneDict.copy()
    for key in otherDict.keys():
        if key in oneDict.keys():
            newDict[key] = oneDict[key], otherDict[key]
        else:
            newDict[key] = otherDict[key]
    return newDict</pre>


<p>To illustrate the differences between the preceding three algorithms,
consider the following two dictionaries:</p>



<pre claSs="monofont">phoneBook1 = {'michael': '555-1212', 'mark': '554-1121', 'emily': '556-0091'}
phoneBook2 = {'latoya': '555-1255', 'emily': '667-1234'}</Pre>


<p>If <Tt CLaSS="monofont">phoneBook1</tT> is possibly out of date, and
<tT CLAss="monofont">phoneBook2</tt> is more up to date but less complete,
the right usage is probably
<TT CLass="monofont">phoneBook1.update(phoneBook2)</tT>. If the two
phoneBooks are supposed to have nonoverlapping sets of keys, using
<TT Class="monofont">newBook = mergeWithoutOverlap(phoneBook1,
phoneBook2)</TT> lets you know if that assumption is wrong.
Finally, if one is a set of home phone numbers and the other a set of
office phone numbers, chances are <TT class="monofont">newBook</tt>
<tt class="monofont">=</tt> <tt clAsS="monofont">mergeWithOverlap(phoneBook1,
phoneBook2)</tt>is what you want, as long as the subsequent code
that uses <tT cLAsS="monofont">newBook</Tt> can deal with the fact that
<Tt CLASs="monofont">newBook['emily']</tt> is the tuple
<tT CLAss="monofont">('556-0091',</tt> <TT CLass="monofont">'667-1234')</tT>.</P>







<H4>9.1.2
Making Copies: The copy Module</H4>


<p>Back to making copies: the <tt class="monofont">[:]</tt> and
<tt class="monofont">.copy()</tt>tricks will get you copies in 90% of the
cases. If you are writing functions that, in true Python spirit, can
deal with arguments of any type, it's sometimes necessary to
make copies of X, regardless of what X is. In
<a NaMe="idx737"></a>comes the
<tT cLAsS="monofont">copy</Tt>
<A nAME="idx738"></A> module. It provides two functions,
<tt clASS="monofont">copy</Tt> and <tt cLASS="monofont">deepcopy</tt>. The first is
just like the <tt CLASs="monofont">[:]</tt> sequence slice operation or the
<tt class="monofont">copy</tt> method of dictionaries. The second is more
subtle and has to do with deeply nested structures (hence the term
<i>deepcopy</i>). Take the example of copying a list
<tt clasS="monofont">listOne </tT>by slicing it from beginning to end using
the <tt cLaSS="monofont">[:]</tT> construct. This technique makes a new list
that contains references to the same objects contained in the
original list. If <A nAmE="idx739"></A>the contents of that original list are
immutable objects, such as numbers or strings, the copy is as good as
a "true" copy. However, suppose that the first element in
<TT clasS="monofont">listOne</TT> is itself a dictionary (or any other
mutable object). The first element of the copy of
<Tt claSS="monofont">listOne</TT> is a new reference to the
<i>same</i> dictionary. So if you then modify that
dictionary, the modification is evident in both
<tt CLASs="monofont">listOne</tt> and the copy of
<tt class="monofont">listOne</tt>. An example makes it much clearer:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import copy</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>listOne = [{"name": "Willie", "city": "Providence, RI"}, 1, "tomato", 3.0]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>listTwo = listOne[:]</B>                   # or listTwo=copy.copy(listOne)
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>listThree = copy.deepcopy(listOne)</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>listOne.append("kid")</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>listOne[0]["city"] = "San Francisco, CA"</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print listOne, listTwo, listThree</B>
[{'name': 'Willie', 'city': 'San Francisco, CA'}, 1, 'tomato', 3.0, 'kid']
[{'name': 'Willie', 'city': 'San Francisco, CA'}, 1, 'tomato', 3.0]
[{'name': 'Willie', 'city': 'Providence, RI'}, 1, 'tomato', 3.0]</pRE>


<P>As you can see, modifying <Tt claSS="monofont">listOne</TT> directly
modified only <tt clASS="monofont">listOne</Tt>. Modifying the first entry
of the list <i>referenced by</i>
<tT CLAss="monofont">listOne</tt> led to changes in
<tt class="monofont">listTwo</tt>, but not in <tt class="monofont">listThree</Tt>;
that's the difference between a shallow copy
(<Tt clAsS="monofont">[:]</Tt>) and a deepcopy. The <TT cLaSS="monofont">copy</TT>
module functions know how to copy all the built-in types that are
reasonably copyable,<font SIZE="1"><sup><a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></sup></FONT>
 including classes and instances.</p>


<blockquote><font size="1">
<p ClAss="footnote">
<sUp><A NaME="FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></SuP>
Some objects don't qualify
as "reasonably copyable," such as modules, file objects,
and sockets. Remember that file objects are different from files on
disk.</P>

<A NAMe="idx830"></a><h4>9.1.3
Sorting and Randomizing</h4>


<P>In <A href="lpython_cnode17.html">Chapter 2</a>, you saw that lists have a
<a name="idx740"></a>sort method that
does an in-place sort. Sometimes you want to iterate over the sorted
contents of a list, without disturbing the contents of this list. Or
you may want to list the sorted contents of a tuple. Because
<a name="idx741"></a>tuples are immutable, an operation such as
<tt claSs="monofont">sort</Tt>, which modifies it in place, is not allowed.
The only solution is to make a list copy of the elements, sort the
list copy, and work with the sorted copy, as in:</p>



<pRe CLaSS="monofont">listCopy = list(myTuple)
listCopy.sort()
for item in listCopy:
    print item                             # or whatever needs doing</pRe>


<P>This solution is also the way to deal with <A NAme="idx742"></a>data
structures that have no inherent order, such as dictionaries. One of
the reasons that dictionaries are so fast is that the implementation
reserves the right to change the order of the keys in the dictionary.
It's really not a problem, however, given that you can iterate
over the keys of a dictionary using an intermediate copy of the keys
of the dictionary:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">keys = myDict.keys()                       # returns an unsorted list of
                                           # the keys in the dict
keys.sort()
for key in keys:                           # print key, value pairs 
    print key, myDict[key]                 # sorted by key</PRE>


<P>The <tt clASS="monofont">sort</Tt> method on lists uses the standard Python
comparison scheme. Sometimes, however, that scheme isn't
what's needed, and you need to sort according to some other
procedure. For example, when sorting a list of words, case (lower
versus UPPER) may not be significant. The standard comparison of text
strings, however, says that all uppercase letters "come
before" all lowercase letters, so '<tt class="monofont">Baby'</tt> is
"less than" '<tt class="monofont">apple'</tt> but
'<tT cLass="monofont">baby'</Tt> is "greater than"
'<TT cLAsS="monofont">apple'</tT>. In order to do a <A NAme="idx743"></a>
<a NAME="idx744"></a>case-independent
sort, you need to define a comparison function that takes two
arguments, and returns -<tt cLASS="monofont">1</tt>, <tt CLASs="monofont">0</tt>,
or <tt class="monofont">1</tt> depending on whether the first argument is
smaller than, equal to, or greater than the second argument. So, for
our case-independent sorting, you can use:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def caseIndependentSort(something, other):</B></pre>

<PrE ClASs="monofont">... <B>   something, other  = string.lower(something), string.lower(other)</b></PRE>

<Pre clASS="monofont">... <B>   return cmp(something, other)</b></pre>

<PRE Class="monofont">... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>testList = ['this', 'is', 'A', 'sorted', 'List']</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>testList.sort()</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print testList</b>
['A', 'List', 'is', 'sorted', 'this']
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>testList.sort(caseIndependentSort)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print testList</b>
['A', 'is', 'List', 'sorted', 'this']</pre>


<p>We're using the built-in function <tt class="monofont">cmp</tt>, which
does the hard part of figuring out that <tT cLass="monofont">'a'</Tt> comes
before <TT cLAsS="monofont">'b'</tT>, <TT Class="monofont">'b'</TT> before
<TT clasS="monofont">'c'</TT>, etc. Our sort function simply lowercases both
items and sorts the lowercased versions, which is one way of making
the comparison case-independent. Also note that the lowercasing
conversion is local to the comparison function, so the elements in
the list aren't modified by the sort.</P>







<h4>9.1.4
Randomizing: The random Module</h4>


<p>What about<a NAME="idx745"></a>
<a name="idx746"></a> randomizing
a sequence, such as a list of lines? The easiest way to randomize a
sequence is to repeatedly use the <tt class="monofont">choice</tt> function
in the <tt clAsS="monofont">random</tt> module, which returns a random
element from the sequence it receives as an argument.<fOnT SiZE="1"><sUp><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></suP></FONt>
 In
order to avoid getting the same line multiple times, remember to
remove the chosen item. When manipulating a list object, use the
<tt cLASS="monofont">remove</tt> method:</p>


<bLOCKquote><font size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sUp><A namE="FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></SUp>
The <TT cLaSS="monofont">random</TT> module provides many other useful
functions, such as the <tt clASS="monofont">random</Tt> function, which
returns a random floating-point number between
and 1. Check a reference source for details.</p>
</foNT></BLockqUOTE>





<pre class="monofont">while myList:                        # will stop looping when myList is empty
    element = random.choice(myList)
    myList.remove(element)
    print element,</pre>


<p>If you need to randomize a nonlist object, it's usually easiest
to convert that object to a list and randomize the list version of
the same data, rather than come up with a new strategy for each data
type. This might seem a wasteful strategy, given that it involves
building intermediate lists that might be quite large. In general,
however, what seems large to you probably won't seem so to the
computer, thanks to the reference system. Also, consider the time
saved by not having to come up with a different strategy for each
data type! Python is designed to save time; if that means running a
slightly slower or bigger program, so be it. If you're handling
enormous amounts of data, it may be worthwhile to optimize. But never
optimize until the need for optimization is clear;
<i>that</i> would be a waste of time.</p>







<h4>9.1.5
Making New Data Structures</h4>


<p>The last point about not reinventing the wheel is especially true
when it comes to <a nAmE="idx747"></a>data structures. For example, Python lists
and dictionaries might not be the lists and dictionaries or mappings
you're used to, but you should avoid designing your own data
structure if these structures will suffice. The algorithms they use
have been tested under wide ranges of conditions, and they're
fast and stable. Sometimes, however, the interface to these
algorithms isn't convenient for a particular task.</p>



<p>For example, computer-science textbooks often describe algorithms in
terms of other data structures such as queues and stacks. To use
these algorithms, it may make sense to come up with a data structure
that has the same methods as these data structures (such as
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">pop</tT> and <tT CLAss="monofont">push</tt> for stacks or
<TT CLass="monofont">enqueue</tT>/<TT Class="monofont">dequeue</TT> for queues).
However, it also makes sense to reuse the built-in list type in the
implementation of a stack. In other words, you need something that
acts like a stack but is based on a list. The easiest solution is to
use a class wrapper around a list. For a minimal stack
implementation, you can do this:</P>



<Pre class="monofont">class Stack:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._data = list(data)
    def push(self, item):
        self._data.append(item)
    def pop(self):
        item = self._data[-1]
        del self._data[-1]
        return item</pre>


<p>The following is simple to write, to understand, to read, and to use:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>thingsToDo = Stack(['write to mom', 'invite friend over', 'wash the kid'])</b></Pre>

<pRe CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>thingsToDo.push('do the dishes')</B></pRE>

<PRe claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>print thingsToDo.pop()</B></pre>

<pRE CLass="monofont">do the dishes
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print thingsToDo.pop()</B></PRE>

<pre class="monofont">wash the kid</pre>


<p>Two standard Python naming
<a name="idx748"></a>conventions are used in the
<tt ClAss="monofont">Stack</tT> class above. The first is that class names
start with an uppercase letter, to distinguish them from functions.
The other is that the <tT ClASs="monofont">_data</Tt> attribute starts with
an underscore. This is a half-way point between public attributes
(which don't start with an underscore), private attributes
(which start with two underscores; see <A href="lpython_cnode63.html">Chapter 6</a>),
and Python-reserved identifiers (which both start and end with two
underscores). What it means is that <tt CLASs="monofont">_data</tt> is an
attribute of the class that shouldn't be needed by clients of
the class. The class designer expects such
"pseudo-private" attributes to be used only by the class
methods and by the methods of any eventual subclass.</p>







<A NAMe="idx840"></a><a nAME="idx841"></A><h4>9.1.6
Making New Lists and Dictionaries: The UserList and
 UserDict Modules</h4>


<p>The <a name="idx749"></a><tt class="monofont">Stack</tt> class
presented earlier does its minimal job just fine. It assumes a fairly
minimal definition of what a stack is, specifically, something that
supports just two operations, a <tt ClAss="monofont">push</tT> and a
<tT ClASs="monofont">pop</Tt>. Quickly, however, you find that some of the
features of lists are really nice, such as the ability to iterate
over all the elements using the <TT CLass="monofont">for...in...</tT>
construct. This can be done by reusing existing code. In this case,
you should use the
<TT Class="monofont">UserList</TT>
<A Name="idx750"></a>
<A NAMe="idx751"></a> class defined in the
<tt class="monofont">UserList</tt> module as a class from which the
<tt class="monofont">Stack</tt> can be derived. The library also includes a
<Tt ClasS="monofont">UserDict</tT> module that is a class wrapper around a
dictionary. In general, they are there to be specialized by
subclassing. In our case:</P>



<pRE cLaSS="monofont"># import the UserList class from the UserList module
from UserList import UserList

# subclass the UserList class
class Stack(UserList):
    push = UserList.append
    def pop(self):
        item = self[-1]                    # uses __getitem__
        del self[-1] 
        return item</PRe>


<p>This <tt CLASs="monofont">Stack</tt> is a subclass of the
<tT CLAss="monofont">UserList</tt> class. The <TT CLass="monofont">UserList
</tt>class implements the behavior of the <tt class="monofont">[]</tt>
brackets by defining the special __<tt clasS="monofont">getitem</tT>__ and
__<tt cLaSS="monofont">delitem</tT>_ <Tt ClASS="monofont">_</Tt> methods among
others, which is why the code in <tt cLASS="monofont">pop</tt> works. You
don't need to define your own __<tt CLASs="monofont">init</tt>__
method because <tT CLAss="monofont">UserList</tt> defines a perfectly good
default. Finally, the <tt class="monofont">push</tt> method is defined just
by saying that it's the same as
<tt class="monofont">UserList</Tt>'s
<Tt clAsS="monofont">append</Tt>
<A NaMe="idx752"></A> method. Now we can do list-like things
as well as stack-like things:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>thingsToDo = Stack(['write to mom', 'invite friend over', 'wash the kid']) </B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print thingsToDo </b>                  # inherited from UserList
['write to mom', 'invite friend over', 'wash the kid']
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>thingsToDo.pop() </b>        
'wash the kid'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>thingsToDo.push('change the oil') </B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>for chore in thingsToDo: </B>          # we can also iterate over the <i>contents </i>
...    <b>print chore                     </b># as "for .. in .." uses __getitem__
...
write to mom
invite friend over
change the oil</PRE>
