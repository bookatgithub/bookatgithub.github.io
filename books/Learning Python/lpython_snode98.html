<h3>9.2
Manipulating Files</h3>


<p>Scripting<a NAME="idx753"></a>
languages were designed in part in order to help people do repetitive
tasks quickly and simply. One of the common things webmasters, system
administrators, and programmers need to do is to take a set of files,
select a subset of those files, do some sort of manipulation on this
subset, and write the output to one or a set of output files. (For
example, in each file in a directory, find the last word of every
other line that starts with something other than the
<tt cLASS="monofont">#</tt> character, and print it along with the name of
the file.) This is a task for which special-purpose tools have been
developed, such as <i>sed</i> and
<I>awk</I>. We find that Python does the job just fine
using very simple tools.</P>




<A name="idx847"></a><h4>9.2.1
Doing Something to Each Line in a File</h4>


<p>The <tt class="monofont">sys</tt>
<a naMe="idx754"></A>
module is most helpful when it comes to dealing with an input file,
parsing the text it contains and processing it. Among its attributes
are three file objects, called
<tt cLaSS="monofont">sys.stdin</tT>
<A nAmE="idx755"></A>,
<TT clasS="monofont">sys.stdout</TT>
<A name="idx756"></A>,
and
<TT Class="monofont">sys.stderr</TT>
<A Name="idx757"></a>.
The names come from the notion of the three
<i>streams</i>, called standard in, standard out, and
standard error, which are used to connect command line tools.
Standard output (<tt class="monofont">stdout</tt>) is used by every
<tt claSs="monofont">print</Tt> statement. It's a file object with all
the output methods of file objects opened in write mode, such as
<tt ClASs="monofont">write</TT> and <tT cLASS="monofont">writelines</tt>. The other
often-used stream is standard in (<tt CLASs="monofont">stdin</tt>), which is
also a file object, but with the input methods, such as
<tT CLAss="monofont">read</tt>, <TT CLass="monofont">readline</tt>, and
<tt class="monofont">readlines</tt>. For example, the following script
counts all the lines in the file that is "piped in":</p>



<pre clAsS="monofont">import sys
data = sys.stdin.readlines()
print "Counted", len(data), "lines."</pre>


<P>On Unix, you could test it by doing something like:</p>



<PRe CLaSs="monofont">% <B>cat countlines.py | python countlines.py</B> 
Counted 3 lines.</PRe>


<p>On Windows or DOS, you'd do:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">C:\&gt; <b>type countlines.py | python countlines.py</B> 
Counted 3 lines.</PRE>


<p>The <tt cLASS="monofont">readlines</tt> function is useful when implementing
simple filter operations. Here are a few examples of such filter
operations:</p>



<dl>
<dt>
<i><font color="#990000">Finding all lines that start with a #</fonT></i></Dt>
<dd>
<PrE ClASs="monofont">import sys
for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
    if line[0] == '#':
        print line,</PrE>


<P>Note that a final comma is needed after the <TT clasS="monofont">print</TT>
statement because the <Tt claSS="monofont">line</TT> string already includes
a newline character as its last character.</p>
</dd>
<dT>
<I><FOnt color="#990000">Extracting the fourth column of a file (where columns are defined by whitespace)</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<pre cLaSs="monofont">import sys, string
for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
    words = string.split(line) 
    if len(words) &gt;= 4:
        print words[3]</prE>


<p>We look at the length of the words list to find if there are indeed
at least four words. The last two lines could also be replaced by the
try/except idiom, which is quite common in Python:</P>



<PrE ClAsS="monofont">try:
        print words[3]
    except IndexError:                     # there aren't enough words
        pass</PRE></dd>

    if len(words) &gt;= 4:

<dt>
<i><font cOlOr="#990000">Printing the first 10 lines, the last 10 lines, and every other line</foNt></I></Dt>

<DD>
<pRe CLASs="monofont">import sys, string
lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
sys.stdout.writelines(lines[:10])          # first ten lines
sys.stdout.writelines(lines[-10:])         # last ten lines
for lineIndex in range(0, len(lines), 2):  # get 0, 2, 4, ...
    sys.stdout.write(lines[lineIndex])     # get the indexed line</pre></DD>
<DT>
<i><fonT COLor="#990000">Counting the number of times the word "Python" occurs in a file</foNT></I></Dt>
<dd>

print string.count(text, 'Python')</pre></dd>
<dt>
<i><fOnT colOr="#990000">Changing a list of columns into a list of rows</FOnT></I></dT>
<dD>
<P>In this more complicated example, the task is to
"transpose" a file; imagine you have a file that looks
like:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">Name:   Willie   Mark   Guido   Mary  Rachel   Ahmed
Level:    5       4      3       1     6        4
Tag#:    1234   4451   5515    5124   1881    5132</Pre>


<p>And you really want it to look like the following instead:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">Name:  Level:  Tag#:
Willie 5       1234
Mark   4       4451
...</PRE>


<P>You could use code like the following:</p>



<pre class="monofont">import sys, string
lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
wordlists = []
for line in lines:
    words = string.split(line)
    wordlists.append(words)
for row in range(len(wordlists[0])):
    for col in range(len(wordlists)):
        print wordlists[col][row] + '\t',
    print</pre>


<p>Of course, you should really use much more defensive programming
techniques to deal with the possibility that not all lines have the
same number of words in them, that there may be missing data, etc.
Those techniques are task-specific and are left as an exercise to the
reader.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h5>9.2.1.1
Choosing chunk sizes</h5>


<P>All the preceding examples assume you can read the entire file at
once (that's what the <tT claSs="monofont">readlines</TT> call
expects). In some cases, however, that's not possible, for
example when processing really huge files on computers with little
memory, or when dealing with files that are constantly being appended
to (such as log files). In such cases, you can use a
<tT ClAsS="monofont">while</TT>/<Tt claSS="monofont">readline</TT> combination,
where some of the file is read a bit at a time, until the end of file
is reached. In dealing with files that aren't line-oriented,
you must read the file a character at a time:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont"># read character by character
while 1:
    next = sys.stdin.read(1)            # read a one-character string
    if not next:                        # or an empty string at EOF
        break
<pre><I>       Process character 'next'</I></PRe></pre>


<p>Notice that the <tt class="monofont">read()</tt> method on file objects
returns an empty string at end of file, which breaks out of the
<tt clasS="monofont">while</tT> loop. Most often, however, the files
you'll deal with consist of line-based data and are processed a
line at a time:</p>



<prE cLAsS="monofont"># read line by line
while 1:
    next = sys.stdin.readline()         # read a one-line string
    if not next:                        # or an empty string at EOF
        break
<PrE><i>       Process line 'next'</I></PRE></pre>







<h4>9.2.2
Doing Something to a Set of Files Specified on the Command Line</H4>


<P>Being able to <A Name="idx758"></a>re<A NAMe="idx759"></a>ad <tt CLASs="monofont">stdin</tt> is a great
feature; it's the foundation of the Unix toolset. However, one
input is not always enough: many tasks need to be performed on sets
of files. This is usually done by having the Python program parse the
list of arguments sent to the script as command-line options. For
example, if you type:</p>



<pre class="monofont">% <b>python myScript.py input1.txt input2.txt input3.txt output.txt</b></pre>


<p>you might think that <i>myScript.py</i> wants to do
something with the first three input files and write a new file,
called <I>output.txt</i>. Let's see what the
beginning of such a program could look like:</P>



<pre ClASs="monofont">import sys<PRe><I>
inputfilenames, outputfilename = sys.argv[1:-1], sys.argv[-1]</i></PRE>
for inputfilename in inputfilenames:
    inputfile = open(inputfilename, "r")
    do_something_with_input(inputfile)
outputfile = open(outputfilename, "w")
write_results(outputfile)</Pre>


<p>The second line extracts parts of the <tT CLAss="monofont">argv</tt>
attribute of the <TT CLass="monofont">sys</tT> module. Recall that
it's a list of the words on the command line that called the
current program. It starts with the name of the script. So, in the
example above, the value of <TT Class="monofont">sys.argv</tt> is:</p>



<pre class="monofont">['myScript.py', 'input1.txt', 'input2.txt', 'input3.txt', 'output.txt'].</pre>


<p>The script assumes that the command line consists of one or more
input files and one output file. So the slicing of the input file
names starts at 1 (to skip the name of the script, which isn't
an input to the script in most cases), and stops before the last word
on the command line, which is the name of the output file. The rest
of the script should be pretty easy to understand (but won't
work until you provide the
<tT cLass="monofont">do_something_with_input()</Tt> and
<TT cLAsS="monofont">write_results()</tT> functions).</P>



<P>Note that the preceding script doesn't actually read in the
data from the files, but passes the file object down to a function to
do the real work. Such a function often uses the
<Tt claSS="monofont">readlines()</TT> method on file objects, which returns
a list of the lines in that file. A generic version of
<tt clASS="monofont">do_something_with_input()</Tt> is:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">def do_something_with_input(inputfile):
    for line in inputfile.readlines()
        process(line)</pre>






<a name="idx854"></a><a name="idx855"></a><h4>9.2.3
The f
ileinput Module</h4>


<p>The combination of this idiom with the preceding one regarding
opening each file in the <Tt ClasS="monofont">sys.argv[1:]</tT> list is so
common that Python 1.5 introduced a new module that's designed
to help do just this task. It's called
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">fileinput</TT> and works like this:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">import fileinput
for line in fileinput.input():
    process(line)</Pre>


<p>The <tT CLAss="monofont">fileinput.input()</tt> call parses the arguments on
the command line, and if there are no arguments to the script, uses
<TT CLass="monofont">sys.stdin</tt> instead. It also provides a bunch of
useful functions that let you know which file and line number
you're currently manipulating:</p>



<pre class="monofont">import fileinput, sys, string
# take the first argument out of sys.argv and assign it to searchterm
searchterm, sys.argv[1:] = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2:]
for line in fileinput.input():
   num_matches = string.count(line, searchterm)
   if num_matches:                     # a nonzero count means there was a match
       print "found '%s' %d times in %s on line %d." % (searchterm, num_matches, 
           fileinput.filename(), fileinput.filelineno())</pre>


<p>If this script were called <i>mygrep.py</i>, it could
be used as follows:</P>



<pRe clAsS="monofont">% <B>python mygrep.py in *.py</b>
found 'in' 2 times in countlines.py on line 2.
found 'in' 2 times in countlines.py on line 3.
found 'in' 2 times in mygrep.py on line 1.
found 'in' 4 times in mygrep.py on line 4.
found 'in' 2 times in mygrep.py on line 5.
found 'in' 2 times in mygrep.py on line 7.
found 'in' 3 times in mygrep.py on line 8.
found 'in' 3 times in mygrep.py on line 12.</PRe>






<H4>9.2.4
Filenames and Directories</h4>


<P>We have now<A NAme="idx760"></a> covered reading existing files,
and if you remember the discussion on the <tT CLAss="monofont">open</tt>
built-in function in <A href="lpython_cnode17.html">Chapter 2</a>, you know how to
create new files. There are a lot of tasks, however, that need
different kinds of <a nAME="idx761"></A>file manipulations, such as
directory and path management and removing files. Your two best
friends in such cases are the <tt class="monofont">os</tt> and
<tt class="monofont">os.path</tt> modules described in <a href="lpython_cnode89.html">Chapter 8</a>.</p>



<p>Let's take a typical example: you have lots of files, all of
which have a space in their name, and you'd like to replace the
spaces with underscores. All you really need is the
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">os.curdir</tT> attribute (which returns an
operating-system specific string that corresponds to the current
directory), the<a NAME="idx762"></a> <tt cLASS="monofont">os.listdir</tt> function
(which returns the list of <a nAME="idx763"></A>filenames in a specified
directory), and the
<tt clASS="monofont">os.rename</Tt>
<a name="idx764"></a> function:</p>



<pre class="monofont">import os, string
if len(sys.argv) == 1:                     # if no filenames are specified,
    filenames = os.listdir(os.curdir)      #   use current dir
else:                                     <tt clAsS="monofont"><i> </i></tT># otherwise, use files specified
    filenames = sys.argv[1:]               #   on the command line
for filename in filenames:
    if ' ' in filename:
        newfilename = string.replace(filename, ' ', '_')
        print "Renaming", filename, "to", newfilename, "..."
        os.rename(filename, newfilename)</pRE>


<p>This program works fine, but it reveals a certain Unix-centrism. That
is, if you call it with wildcards, such as:</P>



<PrE cLASS="monofont">python despacify.py *.txt</pre>


<p>you find that on Unix machines, it renames all the files with names
with spaces in them and that end with <I>.txt</I>. In a
DOS-style shell, however, this won't work because the shell
normally used in DOS and Windows doesn't convert from
<I>*.txt</I> to the list of filenames; it expects the
program to do it. This is called <i>globbing</i>,
because the <tt CLASs="monofont">*</tt> is said to match a glob of
characters.</p>







<H4>9.2.5
Matching Sets of Files: The glob Module</H4>


<P>The <Tt class="monofont">glob</tt>
<a name="idx765"></a>
<a name="idx766"></a> module exports a single function, also
called <Tt ClasS="monofont">glob</tT>, which takes a filename pattern and
returns a list of all the filenames that match that pattern (in the
current working directory):</P>



<pRE cLaSS="monofont">import sys, glob, operator
print sys.argv[1:]
sys.argv = reduce(operator.add, map(glob.glob, sys.argv))
print sys.argv[1:]</PRe>


<p>Running this on Unix and DOS shows that on Unix, the Python
<tt CLASs="monofont">glob</tt> didn't do anything because the globbing
was done by the Unix shell before Python was invoked, and on DOS,
Python's globbing came up with the same answer:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">/usr/python/book$ python showglob.py *.py
['countlines.py', 'mygrep.py', 'retest.py', 'showglob.py', 'testglob.py']
['countlines.py', 'mygrep.py', 'retest.py', 'showglob.py', 'testglob.py']

C:\python\book&gt; <B>python showglob.py *.py</B>
['*.py']
['countlines.py', 'mygrep.py', 'retest.py', 'showglob.py', 'testglob.py']</PRe>


<p>This script isn't trivial, though, because it uses two
conceptually difficult operations; a <tt class="monofont">map</tt> followed
by a <tt class="monofont">reduce</tt>. <Tt ClasS="monofont">map</tT> was mentioned
in <A href="lpython_cnode42.html">Chapter 4</A>, but <tT CLAss="monofont">reduce</tt> is new
to you at this point (unless you have background in LISP-type
languages). <TT CLass="monofont">map</tT> is a function that takes a
callable object (usually a function) and a sequence, calls the
callable object with each element of the sequence in turn, and
returns a list containing the values returned by the function. For an
graphical representation of what <TT Class="monofont">map</TT> does, see
<A href="lpython_snode98.html#9">Figure 9.1</a>.<font size="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</A></sUp></foNt>
</P>


<BlOCkQuOTE><Font sIZE="1">
<P clasS="footnote">
<SUP><a namE="FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</A></SUp>
It turns out that
<tt class="monofont">map</tt> can do more; for example, if
<tt class="monofont">None</tt> is the first argument, <tT cLass="monofont">map</Tt>
converts the sequence that is its second argument to a list. It can
also operate on more than one sequence at a time. Check a reference
source for details.</P>
</FoNT></bLoCKQUote>

<img BORDer="0" width="503" height="207" src="FILES/lpy_0901.gif" alt="figs/lpy_0901.gif"></cEnTer>


<p><Tt CLaSS="monofont">map</tT> is needed here (or something equivalent)
because you don't know how many arguments were entered on the
command line (e.g., it could have been <tT CLAss="monofont">*.py *.txt</tt>
<TT CLass="monofont">*.doc</tT>). So the <TT Class="monofont">glob.glob</TT>
function is called with each argument in turn. Each
<TT class="monofont">glob.glob</tt> call returns a list of filenames that
match the pattern. The <tt class="monofont">map</tt> operation then returns
a list of lists, which you need to convert to a single list—the
combination of all the lists in this list of lists. That means doing
<tt clAsS="monofont">list1</tt> <tT cLAsS="monofont">+</Tt>
<Tt CLASs="monofont">list2</tt> <tT CLAss="monofont">+ ...</tt>
<TT CLass="monofont">+</tT> <TT Class="monofont">listN</tt>. That's exactly
the kind of situation where the <tt class="monofont">reduce</tt> function
comes in handy.</p>



<p>Just as with <tt cLaSs="monofont">map</tt>, <Tt CLaSS="monofont">reduce</tT> takes
a function as its first argument and applies it to the first two
elements of the sequence it receives as its second argument. It then
takes the result of that call and calls the function again with that
result and the next element in the sequence, etc. (See <a href="lpython_snode98.html#10">Figure 9.2</a> for an illustration of
<tt cLASS="monofont">reduce</tt>.) But wait: you need <tt CLASs="monofont">+</tt>
applied to a set of things, and <tT CLAss="monofont">+</tt> doesn't
look like a function (it isn't). So a function is needed that
works the same as <tt class="monofont">+</tt>. Here's one:</p>



<pre claSs="monofont">define myAdd(something, other):
    return something + other</Pre>


<p>You would then use <Tt CLaSS="monofont">reduce(myAdd, map(...))</tT>. This
works fine, but better yet, you can use the <tT CLAss="monofont">add</tt>
function defined in the <TT CLass="monofont">operator</tT> module, which
does the same thing. The <TT Class="monofont">operator</TT> module defines
functions for every syntactic operation in Python (including
attribute-getting and slicing), and you should use those instead of
homemade ones for two reasons. First, they've been coded,
debugged, and tested by Guido, who has a pretty good track record at
writing bugfree code. Second, they're actually C functions, and
applying <TT class="monofont">reduce</tt> (or <tt class="monofont">map</tt>, or
<tt clAsS="monofont">filter</tt>) to C functions results in much faster
performance than applying it to Python functions. This clearly
doesn't matter when all you're doing is going through a
few hundred files once. If you do thousands of globs all the time,
however, speed can become an issue, and now you know how to do it
quickly.</p>

<p>For a graphical representation of what <tt class="monofont">filter</tt>
does, see <a href="lpython_snode98.html#11">Figure 9.3</a>. One nice special feature of
<Tt ClasS="monofont">filter</tT> is that if one passes
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">None</TT> as the first argument, it filters out all
false entries in the sequence. So, to find all the nonempty lines in
a file called <I>myfile.txt</I>, do this:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">lines = open('myfile.txt').readlines()
lines = filter(None, lines)             # remember, the empty string is false</pre>


<P><TT Class="monofont">map</TT>, <TT class="monofont">filter</tt>, and
<tt class="monofont">reduce</tt> are three powerful constructs, and
they're worth knowing about; however, they are never necessary.
It's fairly simple to write a Python function that does the
same thing as any of them. The built-in versions are prob-ably
faster, especially when operating on built-in functions written in C,
such as the functions in the <tt clAsS="monofont">operator</tt>

<H4>9.2.6
Using Temporary Files</h4>


<P>If you've ever written a shell script and needed to use
intermediary files for storing the results of some intermediate
stages of processing, you probably suffered from directory litter.
You started out with 20 files called
<i>log_001.txt</i>, <i>log_002.txt</I>
etc., and all you wanted was one summary file called
<i>log_sum.txt</I>. In addition, you had a whole bunch
of <I>log_001.tmp</i>,
<I>log_001.tm2</I>, etc. files that, while they were
labeled temporary, stuck around. At least that's what
we've seen happen in our own lives. To put order back into your
directories, use temporary files in specific directories and clean
them up afterwards.</p>



<P>To help in this <a NAME="idx770"></a> <a naME="idx771"></A>temporary file-management problem, Python
provides a nice little module called <Tt claSS="monofont">tempfile</TT> that
publishes two functions: <tt clASS="monofont">mktemp()</Tt> and
<tt class="monofont">TemporaryFile()</tt>. The former returns the name of a
file not currently in use in a directory on your computer reserved
for temporary files (such as <i>/tmp</i> on Unix or
<i>C:\TMP</i> on Windows). The latter returns a new
file object directly. For example:</p>



<pre clAsS="monofont"># read input file
inputFile = open('input.txt', 'r')

import tempfile
# create temporary file
tempFile = tempfile.TemporaryFile()                   # we don't even need to 
first_process(input = inputFile, output = tempFile)   # know the filename...

# create final output file
outputFile = open('output.txt', 'w')
second_process(input = tempFile, output = outputFile)</pre>


<P><tT ClASs="monofont">Using tempfile.TemporaryFile()</Tt> works well in cases
where the intermediate steps manipulate file objects. One of its nice
features is that when it's deleted, it automatically deletes
the file it created on disk, thus cleaning up after itself. One
important use of temporary files, however, is in conjunction with the
<TT CLass="monofont">os.system</tT> call, which means using a shell, hence
using filenames, not file objects. For example, let's look at a
program that creates form letters and mails them to a list of email
addresses (on Unix only):</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">formletter = """Dear %s,\nI'm writing to you to suggest that ..."""    # etc. 
myDatabase = [('Bill Clinton', 'bill@whitehouse.gov.us'),
              ('Bill Gates', 'bill@microsoft.com'),
              ('Bob', 'bob@subgenius.org')]
for name, email in myDatabase:
    specificLetter = formletter % name
    tempfilename = tempfile.mktemp()
    tempfile = open(tempfilename, 'w')
    tempfile.write(specificLetter)
    tempfile.close()
    os.system('/usr/bin/mail %(email)s -s "Urgent!" &lt; %(tempfilename)s' % vars()) 
    os.remove(tempfilename)</PRe>


<p>The first line in the <tt CLASs="monofont">for</tt> loop returns a
customized version of the form letter based on the name it's
given. That text is then written to a temporary file that's
emailed to the appropriate email address using the
<tt class="monofont">os.system</tt> call (which we'll cover later in
this chapter). Finally, to clean up, the temporary file is removed.
If you forgot how the <tt class="monofont">% </tT>bit works, go back to
<a href="lpython_cnode17.html">Chapter 2</A> and review it; it's worth knowing.
The <tT ClASs="monofont">vars()</Tt> function is a built-in function that
returns a dictionary corresponding to the variables defined in the
current local namespace. The keys of the dictionary are the variable
names, and the values of the dictionary are the variable values.
<TT CLass="monofont">vars()</tT> comes in quite handy for exploring
namespaces. It can also be called with an object as an argument (such
as a module, a class, or an instance), and it will return the
namespace of that object. Two other built-ins,
<TT Class="monofont">locals()</TT> and <TT clasS="monofont">globals()</TT>, return
the local and global namespaces, respectively. In all three cases,
modifying the returned dictionaries doesn't guarantee any
effect on the namespace in question, so view these as read-only and
you won't be surprised. You can see that the
<Tt class="monofont">vars()</tt> call creates a dictionary that is used by
the string interpolation mechanism; it's thus important that
the names inside the <tt class="monofont">%(...)s</tt> bits in the string
match the variable names in the program.</p>







<h4>9.2.7
More on Scanning Text Files</h4>


<P>Suppose you've run a<a Name="idx772"></A> <a NAmE="idx773"></A> program that stores its output in a text
file, which you need to load. The program creates a file that's
composed of a series of lines that each contain a value and a key
separated by whitespace:</p>



<PrE CLAss="monofont"><a nAME="idx774"></A>value key
value key
value key
<pre><i>and so on...</I></PRE></pre>


<p>A key can appear on more than one line in the file, and you'd
probably like to collect all the values that appear for each given
key as you scan the file. Here's one way to solve this problem:</P>



<PRE class="monofont">#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys, string

entries = {}
for line in open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readlines():
    left, right = string.split(line)    
    try:                                
        entries[right].append(left)       # extend list
    except KeyError:
        entries[right] = [left]           # first time seen

for (right, lefts) in entries.items():
  print "%04d '%s'\titems =&gt; %s" % (len(lefts), right, lefts)</pre>


<p>This script uses the
<tt class="monofont">readlines</tt>
<a nAmE="idx775"></a>
<a nAmE="idx776"></A>
method to scan the text file line by line, and calls the built-in
<tT ClAsS="monofont">string.split</TT> function to chop the line into a list
of substrings—a list containing the value and key strings
separated by blanks or tabs in the file. To store all occurrences of
a key, the script uses a dictionary called
<Tt claSS="monofont">entries</TT>. The <tt clASS="monofont">try</Tt> statement in
the loop tries to add new values to an existing entry for a key; if
no entry exists for the key, it creates one. Notice that the
<tt cLASS="monofont">try</tt> could be replaced with an
<tt class="monofont">if</tt> here:</p>



<pre class="monofont">if entries.has_key(right):        # is it already in the dictionary?
    entries[right].append(left)   # add to the list of current values for key
else:
    entries[right] = [left]       # initialize key's values list</PrE>


<p>Testing whether a dictionary contains a key is sometimes faster than
catching an exception with the <tt ClASs="monofont">try</TT> technique; it
depends on how many times the test is true. Here's an example
of this script in action. The input filename is passed in as a
command-line argument (<tT cLASS="monofont">sys.argv[1]</tt>):</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">% <b>cat data.txt</B>
1       one
2       one
3       two
7       three
8       two
10      one
14      three
19      three
20      three
30      three

% <B>python collector1.py data.txt</B>
0003 'one'      items =&gt; ['1', '2', '10']
0005 'three'    items =&gt; ['7', '14', '19', '20', '30']
0002 'two'      items =&gt; ['3', '8']</Pre>


<p>You can make this code more useful by packaging the scanner logic in
a function that returns the <tT CLAss="monofont">entries</tt> dictionary as
a result and wrapping the printing loop logic at the bottom in an
<tt class="monofont">if</tt> test:</p>



<pre claSs="monofont">#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys, string

def collect(file):
    entries = {}
    for line in file.readlines():
        left, right = string.split(line)    
        try:                                
            entries[right].append(left)                     # extend list
        except KeyError:
            entries[right] = [left]                         # first time seen
    return entries

if __name__ == "__main__":                              # when run as a script
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        result = collect(sys.stdin)                         # read from stdin stream
    else:
        result = collect(open(sys.argv[1], 'r'))  # read from passed filename
    for (right, lefts) in result.items():
        print "%04d '%s'\titems =&gt; %s" % (len(lefts), right, lefts)</Pre>


<p>This way, the program becomes a bit more flexible. By using the
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">if</tT>
<a NAME="idx777"></a> __<tt cLASS="monofont">name</tt>__
<tt CLASs="monofont">== "</tt>__<tT CLAss="monofont">main</tt>_
_<tt class="monofont">"</tt> trick, you can still run it as a top-level
script (and get a display of the <tt class="monofont">results</Tt>), or
import the function it defines and process the resulting dictionary
explicitly:</P>



<pre ClASs="monofont"># run as a script file
% <B>collector2.py &lt; data.txt</B>
result displayed here...

# use in some other component (or interactively)
from collector2 import collect
result = collect(open("spam.txt", "r"))
process result here...</pRe>


<P>Since the <TT Class="monofont">collect</TT> function accepts an open file
object, it also works on any object that provides the methods (i.e.,
interface) built-in files do. For example, if you want to read text
from a simple string, wrap it in a class that implements the required
interface and pass an instance of the class to the
<TT clasS="monofont">collect</TT> function:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>from collector2 import collect </b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>from StringIO import StringIO </b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>str = StringIO("1 one\n2 one\n3 two") </b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>result = collect(str) </b>                   # scans the wrapped string
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print result </b>                            # {'one':['1','2'],'two':['3'<i>]} </i></pre>


<p>This code uses the <tt clAsS="monofont">StringIO</tt> class in the standard
Python library to wrap the string into an instance that has all the
methods file objects have; see the <i>Library
Reference</I> for more details on <tT ClASs="monofont">StringIO</Tt>.
You could also write a different class or subclass from
<TT CLass="monofont">StringIO</tT> if you need to modify its behavior.
Regardless, the <TT Class="monofont">collect</TT> function happily reads
text from the <TT clasS="monofont">StringIO</TT> object
<Tt class="monofont">str</tt>, which happens to be an in-memory object, not
a file.</p>



<p>The main reason all this works is that the <tt class="monofont">collect</tt>
function was designed to avoid making assumptions about the type of
object its <tT cLass="monofont">file</Tt> parameter references. As long as
the object exports a <TT cLAsS="monofont">readlines</tT> method that returns
a list of strings, <TT Class="monofont">collect</TT> doesn't care what
type of object it processes. The interface is all that matters. This
runtime binding<FOnt siZE="1"><SUp><a hrEF="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</A></Sup></font>
 is
an important feature of Python's object system, and allows you
to easily write component programs that communicate with other
components. For instance, consider a program that reads and writes
satellite telemetry data using the standard file interface. By
plugging in an object with the right sort of interface, you can
redirect its streams to live sockets, GUI boxes, web interfaces, or
databases without changing the program i<a name="idx778"></a> <a name="idx779"></a>tself or even recompiling it.</p>


<bLoCkquOtE><FoNT sIzE="1">
<P CLass="footnote">
<sUP><A Name="FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a></SUP>
Runtime binding means that Python
doesn't know which sort of object implements an interface until
the program is running. This behavior stems from the lack of type
declarations in Python and leads to the notion of polymorphism; in
Python, the meaning of a object operation (such as indexing, slicing,
etc.) depends on the object being operated on.</P>
