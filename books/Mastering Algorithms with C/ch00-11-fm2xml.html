                  <H3 class=docSection1Title>Acknowledgments</H3>
                  <P class=docText>The experience of writing a book is not 
                  without its ups and downs. On the one hand, there is 
                  excitement, but there is also exhaustion. It is only with the 
                  support of others that one can truly delight in its pleasures 
                  and overcome its perils. There are many people I would like to 
                  thank.</P>
                  <P class=docText>First, I thank Andy Oram, my editor at 
                  O'Reilly &amp; Associates, whose assistance has been 
                  exceptional in every way. I thank Andy especially for his 
                  continual patience and support. In addition, I would like to 
                  thank Tim O'Reilly and Andy together for their interest in 
                  this project when it first began. Other individuals I 
                  gratefully acknowledge at O'Reilly &amp; Associates are Rob 
                  Romano for drafting the technical illustrations, and Lenny 
                  Muellner and Mike Sierra, members of the tools group, who were 
                  always quick to reply to my questions. I thank Jeffrey Liggett 
                  for his swift and detailed work during the production process. 
                  In addition, I would like to thank the many others I did not 
                  correspond with directly at O'Reilly &amp; Associates but who 
                  played no less a part in the production of this book. Thank 
                  you, everyone.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Several individuals gave me a great deal of 
                  feedback in the form of reviews. I owe a special debt of 
                  gratitude to Bill Greene of Intel Corporation for his 
                  enthusiasm and voluntary support in reviewing numerous 
                  chapters throughout the writing process. I also would like to 
                  thank Alan Solis of Com21 for reviewing several chapters. I 
                  thank Alan, in addition, for the considerable knowledge he has 
                  imparted to me over the years at our weekly lunches. I thank 
                  Stephen Friedl for his meticulous review of the completed 
                  manuscript. I thank Shaun Flisakowski for the review she 
                  provided at the manuscript's completion as well. In addition, 
                  I gratefully acknowledge those who looked over chapters with 
                  me from time to time and with whom I discussed material for 
                  the book on an ongoing basis.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Many individuals gave me support in countless 
                  other ways. First, I would like to thank Jeff Moore, my 
                  colleague and friend at Jeppesen, whose integrity and pursuit 
                  of knowledge constantly inspire me. During our frequent 
                  conversations, Jeff was kind enough to indulge me often by 
                  discussing topics in the book. Thank you, Jeff. I would also 
                  like to thank Ken Sunseri, my manager at Jeppesen, for 
                  creating an environment at work in which a project like this 
                  was possible. Furthermore, I warmly thank all of my friends 
                  and family for their love and support throughout my writing. 
                  In particular, I thank Marc Loudon for answering so many of my 
                  questions. I thank Marc and Judy Loudon together for their 
                  constant encouragement. I thank Shala Hruska for her patience, 
                  understanding, and support at the project's end, which seemed 
                  to last so long.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Finally, I would like to thank Robert 
                  Foerster, my teacher, for the experiences we shared on a 16K 
                  TRS-80 in 1981. I still recall those times fondly. They made a 
                  wonderful difference in my life. For giving me my start with 
                  computers, I dedicate this book to you with affection.</P>
