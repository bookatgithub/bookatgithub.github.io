                  <H2 class=docChapterTitle>Chapter 1. Introduction</H2>
                  <P class=docText>When I was 12, my brother and I studied 
                  piano. Each week we would make a trip to our teacher's house; 
                  while one of us had our lesson, the other would wait in her 
                  parlor. Fortunately, she always had a few games arranged on a 
                  coffee table to help us pass the time while waiting. One game 
                  I remember consisted of a series of pegs on a small piece of 
                  wood. Little did I know it, but the game would prove to be an 
                  early introduction to data structures and algorithms.</P>
                  <P class=docText>The game was played as follows. All of the 
                  pegs were white, except for one, which was blue. To begin, one 
                  of the white pegs was removed to create an empty hole. Then, 
                  by jumping pegs and removing them much like in checkers, the 
                  game continued until a single peg was left, or the remaining 
                  pegs were scattered about the board in such a way that no more 
                  jumps could be made. The object of the game was to jump pegs 
                  so that the blue peg would end up as the last peg and in the 
                  center. According to the game's legend, this qualified the 
                  player as a "genius." Additional levels of intellect were 
                  prescribed for other outcomes. As for me, I felt satisfied 
                  just getting through a game without our teacher's kitten, 
                  Clara, pouncing unexpectedly from around the sofa to sink her 
                  claws into my right shoe. I suppose being satisfied with this 
                  outcome indicated that I simply possessed "common sense."</P>
                  <P class=docText>I remember playing the game thinking that 
                  certainly a deterministic approach could be found to get the 
                  blue peg to end up in the center every time. What I was 
                  looking for was an <SPAN class=docEmphasis>algorithm</SPAN>. 
                  Algorithms are well-defined procedures for solving problems. 
                  It was not until a number of years later that I actually 
                  implemented an algorithm for solving the peg problem. I 
                  decided to solve it in LISP during an artificial intelligence 
                  class in college. To solve the problem, I represented 
                  information about the game in various <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>data structures</SPAN>. Data structures<A 
                  name=IXT-1-313180></A> are conceptual organizations of 
                  information. They go hand in hand with algorithms because many 
                  algorithms rely on them for efficiency.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Often, people deal with information in fairly 
                  loose forms, such as pegs on a board, notes in a notebook, or 
                  drawings in a portfolio. However, to process information with 
                  a computer, the information needs to be more formally 
                  organized. In addition, it is helpful to have a precise plan 
                  for exactly what to do with it. Data structures and algorithms 
                  help us with this. Simply stated, they help us develop 
                  programs that are, in a word, elegant. As developers of 
                  software, it is important to remember that we must be more 
                  than just proficient with programming languages and 
                  development tools; developing elegant software is a matter of 
                  craftsmanship. A good understanding of data structures and 
                  algorithms is an important part of becoming such a 
                  craftsman.</P>
