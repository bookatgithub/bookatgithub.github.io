                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-1-313209></A>As mentioned at the 
                  start of this chapter, a good understanding of data structures 
                  and algorithms is an important part of developing well-crafted 
                  software. Equally important is a dedication to applying sound 
                  practices in software engineering in our implementations. 
                  Software engineering is a broad subject, but a great deal can 
                  be gleaned from a few concepts, which are presented here and 
                  applied throughout the examples in this book.</P><A

                    <P class=docList><A name=IXT-1-313210></A>One way to achieve 
                    modularity in software design is to focus on the development 
                    of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>black boxes</SPAN>. In software, 
                    a black box<A name=IXT-1-313211></A> is a module whose 
                    internals are not intended to be seen by users of the 
                    module. Users interact with the module only through a 
                    prescribed interface made <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphasis>public</SPAN> <A name=IXT-1-313212></A>by 
                    its creator. That is, the creator publicizes only what users 
                    need to know to use the module and hides the details about 
                    everything else. Consequently, users are not concerned with 
                    the details of how the module is implemented and are 
                    prevented (at least in policy, depending on the language) 
                    from working with the module's internals. These ideas are 
                    fundamental to <SPAN class=docEmphasis>data hiding</SPAN> <A 
                    name=IXT-1-313213></A><A name=IXT-1-313214></A>and <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphasis>encapsulation</SPAN>, principles of good 
                    software engineering enforced particularly well by 
                    object-oriented languages. Although languages that are not 
                    object-oriented do not enforce these ideas to the same 
                    degree, we can still apply them. One example in this book is 
                    the design of abstract datatypes. Fundamentally, each 
                    datatype is a structure<A name=IXT-1-313215></A>. Exactly 
                    what one can do with the structure is dictated by the 
                    operations defined for the datatype and publicized in its 
                    header.</P>

                    name=IXT-1-313217></A>We can make programs more readable in 
                    a number of ways. Writing meaningful comments, using aptly 
                    named identifiers, and creating code that is 
                    self-documenting are a few examples. Opinions on how to 
                    write good comments vary considerably, but a good 
                    fundamental philosophy is to document a program so that 
                    other developers can follow its logic simply by reading its 
                    comments. On the other hand, sections of self-documenting 
                    code require few, if any, comments because the code reads 
                    nearly the same as what might be stated in the comments 
                    themselves. One example of self-documenting code in this 
                    book is the use of header files as a means of defining and 
                    documenting public interfaces to the data structures and 
                    algorithms presented.</P>

                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>Unfortunately, as a society we tend to 
                    regard "complex" and "intelligent" as words that go 
                    together. In actuality, intelligent solutions are often the 
                    simplest ones. Furthermore, it is the simplest solutions 
                    that are often the hardest to find. Most of the algorithms 
                    in this book are good examples of the power of simplicity. 
                    Although many of the algorithms were developed and proven 
                    correct by individuals doing extensive research, they appear 
                    in their final form as clear and concise solutions to 
                    problems distilled down to their essence.</P>

                    <P class=docList><A name=IXT-1-313219></A>One of the best 
                    things we can do in software development is to establish 
                    coding conventions and stick to them. Of course, conventions 
                    must also be easy to recognize. After all, a convention is 
                    really no convention at all if someone else is not able to 
                    determine what the convention is. Conventions can exist on 
                    many levels. For example, they may be cosmetic, or they may 
                    be more related to how to approach certain types of problems 
                    conceptually. Whatever the case, the wonderful thing about a 
                    good convention is that once we see it in one place, most 
                    likely we will recognize it and understand its application 
                    when we see it again. Thus, consistency fosters readability 
                    and simplicity as well. Two examples of cosmetic conventions 
                    in this book are the way comments are written and the way 
                    operations associated with data structures are named. Two 
                    examples of conceptual conventions are the way data is 
                    managed in data structures and the way static functions are 
                    used for private functions, that is, functions that are not 
                    part of public interfaces.</P></DD></DL>
