                  <H3 class=docSection1Title>2.2 Storage Allocation</H3>
                  <P class=docText>When we declare a pointer<A 
                  name=IXT-2-313228></A> in C, a certain amount of space is 
                  allocated for it, just as for other types of variables. 
                  Pointers<A name=IXT-2-313229></A> generally occupy one machine 
                  word, but their size can vary. Therefore, for portability, we 
                  should never assume that a pointer has a specific size. 
                  Pointers often vary in size as a result of compiler settings 
                  and type specifiers allowed by certain C implementations. It 
                  is also important to remember that when we declare a pointer, 
                  space is allocated only for the pointer itself; no space is 
                  allocated for the data the pointer references. Storage for the 
                  data is allocated in one of two ways: by declaring a variable 
                  for it or by allocating storage <A name=IXT-2-313230></A><A 
                  name=IXT-2-313231></A>dynamically at runtime (using <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>malloc</SPAN> or <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>realloc</SPAN>, for example).<A 
                  name=IXT-2-313232></A></P>
                  <P class=docText>When we declare a variable, its type tells 
                  the compiler how much storage to set aside for it as the 
                  program runs. Storage for the variable is allocated 
                  automatically, but it may not be persistent throughout the 
                  life of the program. This is especially important to remember 
                  when dealing with pointers to <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>automatic variables</SPAN>. <A 
                  name=IXT-2-313233></A>Automatic variables<A 
                  name=IXT-2-313234></A><A name=IXT-2-313235></A> are those for 
                  which storage is allocated and deallocated automatically when 
                  entering and leaving a block or function. For example, since 
                  <TT><I>iptr</I></TT> is set to the address of the automatic 
                  variable <TT><I>a</I></TT> in the following function <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN>, <TT><I>iptr</I></TT> becomes a 
                  dangling pointer when <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> 
                  returns. This situation occurs because once <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> returns, <TT><I>a</I></TT> is no 
                  longer valid on the program stack (see <A class=docLink 
                  href="ch03-1-fm2xml.html#ch03-1-fm2xml">Chapter 
                  3</A>).</P><PRE>int f(int **iptr) {

int a = 10;
*iptr = &amp;a;

return 0;

}</PRE>
                  <P class=docText>In C, when we dynamically allocate storage, 
                  we get a pointer to some storage on the heap (see <A 
                  class=docLink 
                  href="ch03-1-fm2xml.html#ch03-1-fm2xml">Chapter 
                  3</A>). Since it is then our responsibility to manage this 
                  storage ourselves, the storage remains valid until we 
                  explicitly deallocate it. For example, the storage allocated 
                  by <SPAN class=docEmphasis>malloc</SPAN> in the following code 
                  remains valid until we call <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>free</SPAN> at some later time. Thus, it 
                  remains valid even after <SPAN class=docEmphasis>g</SPAN> 
                  returns (see <A class=docLink 
                  href="#ch02-98900">Figure 
                  2.2</A>), unlike the storage allocated automatically for 
                  <TT><I>a</I></TT> previously. The parameter 
                  <TT><I>iptr</I></TT> is a pointer to the object we wish to 
                  modify (another pointer) so that when <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>g</SPAN> returns, <TT><I>iptr</I></TT> 
                  contains the address returned by <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>malloc</SPAN>. This idea is explored further 
                  in the section on pointers as parameters to functions.</P><PRE>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-2-313236></A>Pointers and storage 
                  allocation are arguably the areas of C that provide the most 
                  fodder for the language's sometimes bad reputation. The misuse 
                  of dynamically allocated storage<A name=IXT-2-313237></A>, in 
                  particular, is a notorious source of <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>memory leaks</SPAN>. Memory leaks<A 
                  name=IXT-2-313238></A> are blocks of storage that are 
                  allocated but never freed by a program, even when no longer in 
                  use. They are particularly detrimental when found in sections 
                  of code that are executed repeatedly. Fortunately, we can 
                  greatly reduce memory leaks by employing consistent approaches 
                  to how we manage storage.</P>
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-2-313239></A>One example of a 
                  consistent approach to storage management is the one used for 
                  <A name=IXT-2-313240></A>data structures presented in this 
                  book. The philosophy followed in every case is that it is the 
                  responsibility of the user to manage the storage associated 
                  with the actual data that the data structure organizes; the 
                  data structure itself allocates storage only for internal 
                  structures used to keep the data organized. Consequently, only 
                  pointers are maintained to the data inserted into the data 
                  structure, rather than private copies of the data. One 
                  important implication of this is that a data structure's 
                  implementation does not depend on the type and size of the 
                  data it stores. Also, multiple data structures are able to 
                  operate on a single copy of data, which can be useful when 
                  organizing large amounts of data.</P>
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-2-313241></A><A 
                  name=IXT-2-313242></A><A name=IXT-2-313243></A>In addition, 
                  this book provides operations for initializing and destroying 
                  data structures. Initialization may involve many steps, one of 
                  which may be the allocation of memory. Destroying a data 
                  structure generally involves removing all of its data and 
                  freeing the memory allocated in the data structure. Destroying 
                  a data structure also usually involves freeing all memory 
                  associated with the data itself. This is the one exception to 
                  having the user manage storage for the data. Since managing 
                  this storage is an application-specific operation, each data 
                  structure uses a function provided by the user when the data 
                  structure is initialized.</P>                  <UL></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
