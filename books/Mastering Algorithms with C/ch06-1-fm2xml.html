                  <H2 class=docChapterTitle>Chapter 6. Stacks and Queues</H2>
                  <P class=docText>Often it is important to store data so that 
                  when it is retrieved later, it is automatically presented in 
                  some prescribed order. One common way to retrieve data is in 
                  the opposite order as it was stored. For example, consider the 
                  data blocks a program maintains to keep track of <A 
                  name=IXT-6-313568></A>function calls<A name=IXT-6-313569></A> 
                  as it runs. These blocks are called <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>activation records</SPAN>.<A 
                  name=IXT-6-313570></A> For a set of functions { <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN><SUB>1</SUB>, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN><SUB>2</SUB>, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN><SUB>3</SUB>} in which <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN><SUB>1</SUB> calls <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN><SUB>2</SUB> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN><SUB>2</SUB> calls <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN><SUB>3</SUB>, a program allocates 
                  one activation record each time one of the functions is 
                  called. Each record persists until its function returns. Since 
                  functions return in the opposite order as they were called, 
                  activation records are retrieved and relinquished in the 
                  opposite order as they were allocated. Another common way to 
                  retrieve data is in the same order as it was stored. For 
                  example, this might be useful with a bunch of things to do; 
                  often we want to do the first item first and the last item 
                  last. Stacks and queues are simple data structures that help 
                  in such common situations.</P>

                    protects. If so, the process blocks and waits until another

                    processes may be waiting on a resource, some implementations

                    In real-time systems, events frequently occur when the 
                    system is not quite ready to handle them. Therefore, a queue 
                    keeps track of events so that they can be processed at a 
                    later time in the order they were received.</P>
