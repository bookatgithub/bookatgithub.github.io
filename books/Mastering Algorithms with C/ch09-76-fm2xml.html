                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-9-314074></A>Binary search 
                  trees<A name=ch09-idx-376428-1></A> <A 
                  name=ch09-idx-376428-2></A><A name=ch09-idx-376428-3></A>are 
                  binary trees organized specifically for searching. To search 
                  for a node in a binary search tree, we start at the root of 
                  the tree and descend level by level until we find the node we 
                  are looking for. When we encounter a node greater than the 
                  desired node, we follow its left pointer. When we encounter a 
                  node that is less, we follow its right pointer. For example, 
                  to locate 15 in the tree of <A class=docLink 
                  href="#ch09-67682">Figure 
                  9.7</A>, start at the root and move to the left since 15 is 
                  less than 20, then to the right since 15 is greater than 09, 
                  at which point we find 15. If we reach the end of a branch 
                  before locating the desired node, it does not exist.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Of course, the process of searching a binary 
                  tree depends on nodes having been inserted in a similar way. 
                  Thus, to insert a node, we start at the root of the tree and 
                  descend level by level, moving left or right as appropriate. 
                  When we reach the end of a branch, we make the insertion. For 
                  example, to insert 65 into the tree of <A class=docLink 
                  href="#ch09-67682">Figure 
                  9.7</A>, we start at the root and move to the right since 65 
                  is greater than 20, then to the right again since 65 is 
                  greater than 53, and then to the left since 65 is less than 
                  79. This point is the end of a branch, so we insert the key as 
                  the left child of 79.<A name=IXT-9-314075></A> Duplicate keys 
                  are not allowed.</P>

                  <P class=docText>Binary search trees are efficient structures 
                  for searching because in the worst case, we only end up 
                  searching the data in one branch, instead of having to search 
                  every piece of data. Thus, searching becomes an <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>O</SPAN> (lg <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) operation, where <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> is the number of nodes in the tree, 
                  provided the tree is kept balanced. <A 
                  name=IXT-9-314076></A>Recall that keeping a tree balanced 
                  means that it will be as short as possible for a given number 
                  of nodes. Keeping a binary search tree balanced is important 
                  because it means that no branch we search will be 
                  exceptionally long.</P>
                  <P class=docText>To understand further the importance of 
                  keeping a binary search tree balanced, consider what happens 
                  as a binary search tree becomes more and more unbalanced. As 
                  this occurs, searching for a node approaches <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>O</SPAN> (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>), 
                  which is no better than searching from one end of the data to 
                  the next. For example, imagine a binary search tree containing 
                  216 words from a dictionary inserted in alphabetical order 
                  (see <A class=docLink 
                  href="#ch09-25742">Figure 
                  9.8</A>). In this case, the tree consists of a single branch 
                  to the right, and searching for a word could require 
                  inspecting as many as 2<SUP>16</SUP> words. However, if we 
                  insert the words in a random fashion, the tree should end up 
                  at least somewhat balanced, and we can expect to traverse 
                  closer to lg 2<SUP>16</SUP> = 16 words in the worst case. 
                  Since normally the order in which nodes are inserted and 
                  removed is not something we can control, we cannot rely on 
                  this method to keep a tree balanced. Instead, we must take a 
                  more proactive approach.</P>
