                  <P class=docText><A name=ch11-idx-957597-1></A>Graphs are 
                  composed of two types of elements: <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>vertices</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>edges</SPAN>. Vertices<A 
                  name=IXT-11-314274></A><A name=IXT-11-314275></A> represent 
                  objects, and edges establish relationships or connections 
                  between the objects. In many problems, values, or <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>weights</SPAN>, are associated with a 
                  graph's edges; however, such problems will not be considered 
                  further until <A class=docLink 
                  href="ch16-1-fm2xml.html#ch16-1-fm2xml">Chapter

                  name=IXT-11-314277></A>Graphs may be either <SPAN

                  <A name=IXT-11-314279></A>. In a <A name=IXT-11-314280></A><A 
                  name=IXT-11-314281></A>directed graph, edges go from one 
                  vertex to another in a specific direction. Pictorially, a 
                  directed graph is drawn with circles for its vertices and 
                  arrows for its edges (see <A class=docLink 
                  href="#ch11-63220">Figure 
                  11.1</A>a). Sometimes the edges of a directed graph are 
                  referred to as <SPAN class=docEmphasis>arcs</SPAN><A 
                  name=IXT-11-314282></A>. In an undirected graph, edges have no 
                  direction; thus, its edges are depicted using lines instead of 
                  arrows (see <A class=docLink

                  <P class=docText>Formally, a graph is a pair <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>G</SPAN> = (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>V</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>E 
                  </SPAN>), where <SPAN class=docEmphasis>V</SPAN> is a set of 
                  vertices and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>E</SPAN> is a binary 
                  relation on <SPAN class=docEmphasis>V</SPAN>. In a directed 
                  graph, if an edge goes from vertex <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN> to vertex <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>E</SPAN> 
                  contains the ordered pair (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN>, 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>). For example, in <A 
                  class=docLink 
                  href="#ch11-63220">Figure 
                  11.1</A>a, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>V</SPAN> = {1, 2, 3, 4} and 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>E</SPAN> = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), 
                  (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}. By convention, parentheses 
                  are used instead of braces for sets that represent edges in a 
                  graph. In an undirected graph, because an edge (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>) 
                  is the same as (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN>), either edge is listed in <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>E</SPAN>, but not both. Thus, in <A 
                  class=docLink 
                  href="#ch11-63220">Figure 
                  11.1</A>b, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>V</SPAN> = {1, 2, 3, 4} and

                  (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)}. Edges may point back to the same 
                  vertex in a directed graph, but not in an undirected 
graph.</P>
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-11-314283></A>Two important 
                  relations in graphs are <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>adjacency</SPAN><A name=IXT-11-314284></A> 
                  and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>incidence</SPAN><A 
                  name=IXT-11-314285></A>. Adjacency is a relation between two 
                  vertices. If a graph contains the edge (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>), 
                  vertex <SPAN class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN> is said to be <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>adjacent to</SPAN> vertex <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN>. In an undirected graph, this 
                  implies that vertex <SPAN class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN> is also 
                  adjacent to vertex <SPAN class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>. In other 
                  words, the adjacency relation is <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>symmetric</SPAN> in an undirected graph. 
                  This is not necessarily true in a directed graph. For example, 
                  in <A class=docLink 
                  href="#ch11-63220">Figure 
                  11.1</A>a, vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, but vertex 1 is 
                  not adjacent to vertex 2. On the other hand, vertices 2 and 3 
                  are adjacent to each other. A graph in which every vertex is 
                  adjacent to each other is called <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>complete</SPAN><A 
                  name=IXT-11-314286></A>.</P>
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-11-314287></A>Incidence is a 
                  relation between a vertex and an edge. In a directed graph, 
                  the edge (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN>, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>) is <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>incident from</SPAN> or <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>leaves</SPAN> vertex <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN> and is <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>incident to</SPAN> or <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>enters</SPAN> vertex <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>. Thus, in <A class=docLink 
                  href="#ch11-63220">Figure 
                  11.1</A>a, edge (1, 2) is incident from vertex 1 and incident 
                  to vertex 2. In a directed graph, the <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>in-degree</SPAN> <A 
                  name=IXT-11-314288></A>of a vertex is the number of edges 
                  incident to it. Its <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>out-degree</SPAN><A name=IXT-11-314289></A> 
                  is the number of edges incident from it. In an undirected 
                  graph, the edge (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN>, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>) is <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>incident on</SPAN> vertices <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>u</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>v</SPAN>. In an undirected graph, the <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>degree</SPAN> of a vertex is the number of 
                  edges incident on it.</P>

                  is a path that includes the same vertex two or more times. 
                  That is, in a directed graph, a path is a cycle if one of its

                  <P class=docText>To begin, we select a start vertex and color 
                  it gray. We color all other vertices in the graph white. The 
                  start vertex is also placed alone in a queue. The algorithm 
                  then proceeds as follows: for each vertex in the queue 
                  (initially only the start vertex), we peek at the vertex at 
                  the front of the queue and explore each vertex adjacent to it. 
                  As each adjacent vertex is explored, its color will be white

                  at the end of the queue. If its color is not white, it has

                  traversed before reaching each vertex, which turns out to be 
                  the shortest path to each vertex in graphs whose edges are not

                  or 3 consists of one hop, recorded when we first discover 
                  vertex 2 and 3. The shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 
                  consists of two hops: one hop is recorded as we discover 
                  vertex 2 from 1, and another is recorded when we discover 
                  vertex 4 from 2. We can also use breadth-first search to

                  Thus, the search continually tries to explore as deep as it

                  indicate it has been discovered. Then, we select a new vertex 
                  from the set of undiscovered vertices adjacent to it, which 
                  are white, and repeat the process. When there are no white 
                  vertices adjacent to the currently selected vertex, we have 
                  searched as deep as possible. Thus, we color the currently 
                  selected vertex black to indicate that we are finished with 
                  it, and we backtrack to explore the white vertices adjacent to 
                  the previously selected vertex.</P>
                  <P class=docText>We continue this process until the vertex we 
                  selected as the start vertex has no more white vertices 
                  adjacent to it. This process visits only the vertices 
                  reachable from the vertex at which we start. Therefore, the 
                  entire process must be repeated for each vertex in the graph.

                  When we restart at a vertex that is already black, the search 
                  stops immediately, and we move on to the next vertex. <A
