                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-13-314566></A>Although factoring 
                  and applying formulas are simple ways to determine the roots 
                  of polynomial equations, a great majority of the time 
                  polynomials are of a large enough degree and sufficiently 
                  complicated that we must turn to some method of approximation. 
                  One of the best approaches is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Newton's 
                  method</SPAN>. Fundamentally, Newton's method looks for a root 
                  of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f </SPAN>(<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) by moving closer and closer to it 
                  through a series of iterations. We begin by choosing an 
                  initial value <SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> = <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN><SUB>0</SUB> that we think is near 
                  the root we are interested in. Then, we iterate using the 
                  formula:</P>
                  <P class=docText><IMG height=37 alt=figs/equation.1306.gif

                  + 1</SUB> is a satisfactory approximation. In this formula, 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) is the polynomial for which we are

                  (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) is the <SPAN

                  <H4 class=docSection2Title>13.7.2 Computing the Derivative of 
                  a Polynomial</H4>
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-13-314567></A>The derivative of a 
                  function is fundamental to calculus and can be described in 
                  many ways. For now, let's simply look at a formulaic 
                  description, specifically for polynomials. To compute the 
                  derivative of a polynomial, we apply to each of its terms one 
                  of two formulas:</P>
                  <P class=docText><IMG height=32 alt=figs/equation.1307.gif 
                  src="image/equation.1307.gif" width=148 border=0></P>
                  <P class=docText>where <SPAN class=docEmphasis>k</SPAN> is a 
                  constant, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>r</SPAN> is a rational 
                  number, and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> is an unknown. 
                  The symbol <SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> /<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>dx</SPAN> means "derivative of," where <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> is the variable in the polynomial. 
                  For each term that is a constant, we apply the first formula; 
                  otherwise, we apply the second. For example, suppose we have 
                  the function:</P>
                  <P class=docText><IMG height=20 alt=figs/equation.1308.gif 
                  src="image/equation.1308.gif" width=142 border=0></P>
                  <P class=docText>In order to compute <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f 
                  '</SPAN> (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>), the derivative of 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>), we apply the second formula to 
                  the first three terms of the polynomial, and the first formula 
                  to the last term, as follows:</P>
                  <P class=docText><IMG height=24 alt=figs/equation.1309.gif 
                  src="image/equation.1309.gif" width=403 border=0></P>
                  <P class=docText>Sometimes it is necessary to compute 
                  higher-order derivatives as well, which are derivatives of 
                  derivatives. For example, the second derivative of <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>), 
                  written <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f ''</SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>), is the derivative of <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f '</SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>). Similarly, the third derivative 
                  of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>), written <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f 
                  ''' </SPAN>(<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>), is the 
                  derivative of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f ''</SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>), and so forth. Thus, to compute 
                  the second derivative of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> 
                  (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) in the previous equation, 
                  we compute the derivative of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f ' 
                  </SPAN>(<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>), as follows:</P>

                  <P class=docText>Now let's look at what derivatives really

                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) is increasing; if the value is

                  href="#ch13-30-fm2xml">Figure 
                  13-8</A> illustrates that this function appears to have three 
                  roots: one on the interval [-2, -1], another on the interval 
                  [0, -1], and a third on the interval [2, 3]. Once we have an 
                  idea of the number and location of a function's roots, we test 
                  each interval against the rules for selecting an initial 
                  iteration point. To do this, we need to know the 
following:</P>

                  src="image/equation.1313.gif" width=352 border=0></P>
                  <P class=docText>Using this information, we see that the 
                  interval [-2, -1] satisfies the first rule because <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (-2) = -4.2 and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (-1) = 2.8, and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f '</SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) does not change sign on the 
                  interval: it is always positive. Considering this, we know 
                  there is, in fact, one and only one root on the interval [-2, 
                  -1]. To satisfy the second rule, we see that <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f '' (x</SPAN>) does not change sign on the 
                  interval: it is negative. We select <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN><SUB>0</SUB> = -2 as the initial 
                  iteration point since <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (-2) = 
                  -4.2 is also negative. <A class=docLink

                  <P class=docText>Moving to the root on the interval [0, 1], we 
                  see that the first rule is satisfied just as for the previous 
                  interval. However, the sign of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f 
                  ''</SPAN> (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN>) is not constant 
                  on this interval; therefore, the interval does not satisfy the 
                  second rule. Suspecting that the root is closer to 1 than 0, 
                  we try the interval [0.5, 1] next, which corrects the problem. 
                  The first rule is satisfied because <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (0.5) = 0.175 and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (1) = -1.2, and <SPAN

                  select <SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN><SUB>0</SUB> = 0.5 
                  since <SPAN class=docEmphasis>f</SPAN> (0.5) = 0.175 is
