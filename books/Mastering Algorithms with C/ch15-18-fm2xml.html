                  <P class=docText><A name=ch15-idx-370708-1></A><A 
                  name=ch15-idx-370708-2></A><A name=ch15-idx-370708-3></A>RSA 
                  (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the most popular asymmetric, 
                  or public-key, ciphers. <A name=IXT-15-314953></A>RSA is 
                  asymmetric because the key used to encipher data is not the 
                  same key used to decipher it. Like DES, RSA is a block cipher, 
                  but the block size varies depending on the size of the keys. 
                  If the amount of data to be encrypted is not an even multiple 
                  of this size, it is padded in some application-specific 
                  way.</P>
                  <P class=docText>One important implication of RSA being an 
                  asymmetric cipher is that when transmitting data across a 
                  network, the key used to encipher the data does not have to be 
                  transmitted with the data itself. Thus, there is less chance 
                  of having the key compromised. RSA is also useful when parties 
                  enciphering data are not allowed to decipher the data of 
                  others. Parties who wish to encipher data use one key, which 
                  is considered public, while parties allowed to decipher the 
                  data use a second key, which they keep private.<A 
                  name=ch15-idx-370716-1></A></P>
                  <P class=docText>RSA is considered very secure, but it runs 
                  considerably slower than DES. As with DES, the security of RSA 
                  has never been proven, but it is related to the difficult 
                  problem of factoring large numbers (numbers containing at 
                  least 200 decimal digits). Since no efficient solutions are 
                  known for this problem, it is conjectured that there are no 
                  efficient ways to crack RSA.</P>
                  <P class=docText>RSA is based on principles that are less 
                  obtuse than the numerous permutations and substitutions 
                  performed in DES. Fundamentally, enciphering and deciphering 
                  data revolves around <SPAN class=docEmphasis>modular 
                  exponentiation</SPAN>, <A name=IXT-15-314954></A>an operation 
                  in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>modular arithmetic</SPAN>. Modular 
                  arithmetic is integer arithmetic as usual except that when we 
                  work modulo <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>, every result 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> is replaced with a member of 
                  {0, 1, . . . , <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> - 1} so that 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> mod <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> is the remainder of <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> /<SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>. 
                  For example, 40 mod 11 = 7 because 40/11 = 3 with a remainder 
                  of 7. Modular exponentiation is the process of computing <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>ab</SPAN> mod <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>.</P><A name=ch15-19-fm2xml></A>
                  <H4 class=docSection2Title>15.5.1 Computing Public and Private 
                  Keys</H4>
                  <P class=docText>In RSA, the public key and private key work 
                  together as a pair. The public key is used to encipher a block 
                  of data, after which only the corresponding private key can be 
                  used to decipher it. When generating keys, we follow a few 
                  steps to ensure that this marriage works. These steps also 
                  ensure that there is no practical way to determine one key 
                  from the other.</P>
                  <P class=docText>To begin, we select two large prime numbers, 
                  which are called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> (see the related topics at the end 
                  of the chapter). Considering today's factoring technology, 
                  these each should be at least 200 decimal digits to be 
                  considered secure in practice. We then compute <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>, the product of these numbers:</P>
                  <P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>n = pq</SPAN></P>
                  <P class=docText>Next, we choose a small odd integer <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN>, which will become part of the 
                  public key. The most important consideration in choosing <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> is that it should have no factors 
                  in common with (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> - 1)(<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> - 1). In other words, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> is relatively prime with (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> - 1) (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> - 1). For example, if <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> = 11 and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> = 19, then <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> = (11)(19) = 209. Here we might 
                  choose <SPAN class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> = 17 because (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> - 1)(<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> - 1) = (10)(18) = 180, and 17 and 
                  180 have no common factors. Common choices for <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> are 3, 17, and 65,537. Using one of 
                  these values does not jeopardize the security of RSA because 
                  deciphering data is a function of the private key.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Once we have chosen a value for <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN>, we compute a corresponding value 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN>, which will become part of 
                  the private key. To do this, we compute the multiplicative 
                  inverse of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN>, modulo (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> - 1)(<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> - 1), as follows:</P>
                  <P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>d = 
                  e<SUP>-1</SUP></SPAN> mod (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p-1)(q-1)</SPAN></P>
                  <P class=docText>The way to think of this is: what value of 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> satisfies <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>ed </SPAN>mod (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> - 1)(<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> - 1) = 1? For example, in the 
                  equation 17<SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> mod 180 = 1, one 
                  possible value for <SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> is 53. 
                  Other possibilities are 233, 413, 593, and so forth. An 
                  extension of Euclid's algorithm is used to compute 
                  multiplicative modular inverses in practice (see the related 
                  topics at the end of the chapter). In this book, code is 
                  provided for using <SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> but not for deriving them.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Now that we have values for both <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN>, we publish (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) 
                  as the public key <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN> and keep 
                  (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN>, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) secret as the private key <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>S</SPAN>, as shown:</P>
                  <P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>p = (e, n)</SPAN></P>
                  <P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>S = (d,n)</SPAN></P>
                  <P class=docText>Parties who encipher data use <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN>. Those who decipher data use <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>S</SPAN>. To ensure that even someone who 
                  knows <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN> cannot compute <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>S</SPAN>, the values used for <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> must never be revealed.</P>
                  <P class=docText>The security offered by <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>S</SPAN> together comes from the fact that 
                  multiplication is a good <SPAN class=docEmphasis>one-way 
                  function</SPAN>. One-way functions are fundamental to 
                  cryptography. Simply stated, a one-way function is a function 
                  that is relatively easy to compute in one direction but 
                  impractical to reverse. For example, in RSA, multiplying <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> is a one-way function because 
                  although multiplying <SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> is easy, factoring <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> back into <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> is extremely time-consuming, 
                  provided the values chosen for <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> are large enough.</P>
                  <P class=docText>The steps performed to compute <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>S</SPAN> have their origin in some 
                  interesting properties of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Euler's 
                  function</SPAN><A name=IXT-15-314955></A> (pronounced 
                  "oiler"). In particular, these properties allow us to do 
                  useful things with modular exponentiation. Euler's function, 
                  denoted <SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT 
                  face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>), defines how many numbers less 
                  than <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> are <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>relatively prime</SPAN> with <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>. Two numbers are said to be 
                  relatively prime if their only common factor is 1. As an 
                  example of Euler's function, <SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT 
                  face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (8) = 4 because there are four 
                  numbers less than 8 that are relatively prime with 8, namely 
                  1, 3, 5, and 7.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Euler's function has two properties that are 
                  particularly relevant to RSA. First, when <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> is prime, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) = <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> 
                  - 1. This is because the only factors of <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> are 1 and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>; thus, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> is relatively prime with all of the 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> - 1 numbers before it. 
                  Another interesting property is that <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) is the <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>exponential period</SPAN><A 
                  name=IXT-15-314956></A> modulo <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> for numbers relatively prime with 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>. This means that for any 
                  number <SPAN class=docEmphasis>a</SPAN> &lt; <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> relatively prime with <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>a 
                  </SPAN><SUP><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SUP><SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis> </SPAN><SUP>(</SUP><SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN><SUP>)</SUP> mod <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> = 1. For example, 1<SUP>4</SUP> mod 
                  8 = 1, 3<SUP>4</SUP> mod 8 = 1, 5<SUP>4</SUP> mod 8 = 1, and 
                  7<SUP>4</SUP> mod 8 = 1. Multiplying both sides of this 
                  equation by <SPAN class=docEmphasis>a</SPAN> yields:</P>
                  <P class=docText><IMG height=23 alt=figs/equation.1504.gif 
                  src="image/equation.1504.gif" width=286 border=0></P>
                  <P class=docText>Hence, 1<SUP>5</SUP> mod 8 = 1, 3<SUP>5</SUP> 
                  mod 8 = 3, 5<SUP>5</SUP> mod 8 = 5, and 7<SUP>5</SUP> mod 8 = 
                  7. This algebraic adjustment is powerful because for some 
                  equation <SPAN class=docEmphasis>c</SPAN> = <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>me</SPAN> mod <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>, it lets us find a value <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> so that <SPAN class=docEmphasis>c 
                  d</SPAN> mod <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> = <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>m</SPAN>. This is the identity that allows 
                  us to encipher data in RSA and then decipher the data back as 
                  shown below:</P>
                  <P class=docText><IMG height=26 alt=figs/equation.1505.gif

                  <P class=docText>The relationship of Euler's function with 
                  exponential periods guarantees that any block of data we 
                  encipher will decipher again uniquely. To find <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN>, we solve the equation <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> = <SPAN class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> 
                  <SUP>- 1</SUP><SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT 
                  face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) 
                  + 1. Unfortunately, there is not always an integer solution to 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> = <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN><SUP> - 1</SUP><SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) + 1. For example, consider if 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> = 5 and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> = 13. In this case, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> = (1/5)((13 - 1) + 1) = (1/5)(13). 
                  To deal with this, we compute <SPAN class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> 
                  modulo <SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT 
                  face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>). In other words, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> = (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN><SUP> - 1</SUP><SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) + 1) mod <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>), which can be simplified to:</P>
                  <P class=docText><IMG height=22 alt=figs/equation.1506.gif 
                  src="image/equation.1506.gif" width=112 border=0></P>
                  <P class=docText>We can make this simplification because 
                  (<SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> 
                  (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) + 1) mod <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) = (<SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT 
                  face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) 
                  + 1) - <SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT 
                  face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) 
                  = 1. We can verify this by inserting any number in place of 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> 
                  (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>). Notice the similarity 
                  between this equation and the one used for <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> earlier in the steps for computing 
                  keys. This provides a way to compute <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN> from <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>. Of course, since <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> are public and potentially known to 
                  an adversary, one might ask: doesn't this give an adversary 
                  the same opportunity to compute the private key? At this point 
                  it is worth examining where RSA's security comes from.</P>
                  <P class=docText>RSA gets its security from the critical fact 
                  that Euler's function is <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>multiplicative</SPAN>. This means that if 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> are relatively prime (which they 
                  are if we choose them both to be prime), then <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>pq</SPAN>) = <SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT 
                  face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN>)<SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT 
                  face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN>). Thus, if we have two primes <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN>, and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> = <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>pq</SPAN>, then <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>) = (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> - 1)(<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> - 1), and most importantly:</P>
                  <P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>d = 
                  e<SUP>-1</SUP></SPAN> mod <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>(p-1)(q-1)</SPAN></P>
                  <P class=docText>Therefore, even though an adversary might 
                  know both <SPAN class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>, in order to compute <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>d</SPAN>, she would have to know <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis><FONT face=symbol>f</FONT></SPAN> (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>), which can only be determined in a 
                  practical manner by knowing both <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN>. Since these are not known, the 
                  adversary is left to factor <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>, 
                  an extremely time-consuming process, provided the values 
                  chosen for <SPAN class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> are large enough. <A

                  <H4 class=docSection2Title>15.5.2 Enciphering and Deciphering 
                  Data Blocks</H4>
                  <P class=docText>To encipher and decipher data with RSA, we 
                  first need to choose a block size. To do this, we must ensure 
                  that the largest value that the block can store, considering 
                  its total number of bits, is less than <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>. For example, if <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>p</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>q</SPAN> are primes containing 200 decimal 
                  digits, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> will be just under 
                  400 decimal digits. Therefore, we should choose a block size 
                  small enough to store only those numbers with less than this 
                  many decimal digits. In practice, we often choose the block 
                  size in bits to be the largest power of 2 less than <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>. For example, if <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> were 209, we would choose a block 
                  size of 7 bits because 2<SUP>7</SUP> = 128 is less than 209, 
                  but 2<SUP>8</SUP> = 256 is greater.</P>
                  <P class=docText>To encipher a block of plaintext <SPAN

                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>M</SPAN>, we use the public key (<SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>e</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>)

                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>. This yields a block of ciphertext 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Ci</SPAN>. The modulo <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> operation ensures that <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>Ci</SPAN> will fit into the same size block 
                  as the plaintext. Thus, to encipher a block of plaintext:</P>

                  <P class=docText>It was mentioned earlier that Euler's
