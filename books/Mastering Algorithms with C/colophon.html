                <TD vAlign=top>Colophon 
                  <P class=docText>Our look is the result of reader comments, 
                  our own experimentation, and feedback from distribution 
                  channels. Distinctive covers complement our distinctive 
                  approach to technical topics, breathing personality and life 
                  into potentially dry subjects.</P>
                  <P class=docText>The animals on the cover of <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>Mastering Algorithms with C</SPAN> are sea 
                  horses. Sea horses are of the family <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>Syngnathidae</SPAN>, genus Hippocampus. The 
                  word "hippocampus" comes from the Greek for "bent horse." The 
                  sea horse's unusual-looking body is formed by 50 or so bony 
                  plates that encircle the body to create rings of armor. Within 
                  their narrow snouts are tubes through which they feed, sucking 
                  in plankton and tiny fish larvae. The male sea horse has a 
                  pouch in his belly, into which a female lays 100 or more eggs 
                  at a time. The male fertilizes the eggs in the pouch and 
                  carries them until they hatch, ten days to six weeks later, 
                  depending on the sea horse species.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Sea horses are found mostly in shallow 
                  tropical and subtropical waters, although there are some 
                  ocean-dwelling sea horse species. All sea horses use their 
                  pelvic and pectoral fins for steering. They swim slowly, in an 
                  upright position, and take frequent breaks. During these 
                  breaks they wrap their prehensile tails around a piece of 
                  seaweed or coral to anchor themselves. In addition to 
                  providing a resting place, the seaweed and coral provide good 
                  camouflage for the sea horse.</P>
                  <P class=docText>The largest sea horse species is the Pacific 
                  sea horse, measuring approximately 12 inches long. The 
                  smallest is the dwarf sea horse, which measures only an inch 
                  and a half long.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Jeffrey Liggett was the production editor for 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Mastering Algorithms with C</SPAN>; 
                  Cindy Kogut was the copyeditor; Ellie Fountain Maden was the 
                  proofreader; Sebastian Banker provided production assistance; 
                  Claire Cloutier LeBlanc, Nancy Wolfe Kotary, and Melanie Wang 
                  provided quality control. Robert Romano and Rhon Porter 
                  created the illustrations using Adobe Photoshop 5 and 
                  Macromedia FreeHand 8. Mike Sierra provided FrameMaker 
                  technical support. William Meyers wrote the index with 
                  production assistance by Seth Maislin and Brenda Miller.</P>
                  <P class=docText>Hanna Dyer designed the cover of this book 
                  based on a series design by Edie Freedman. The illustration is 
                  by Lorrie LeJeune. The cover layout was produced by Kathleen 
                  Wilson with QuarkXPress 3.32 using the ITC Garamond font. 
                  Kathleen Wilson designed the diskette label.</P>
                  <P class=docText>The inside layout was designed by Alicia Cech 
                  based on a series design by Nancy Priest. The inside layout 
                  was implemented in FrameMaker 5.5.6 by Mike Sierra. The text 
                  and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book. 
                  This colophon was written by Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary.</P>
                  <P class=docText>The online edition of this book was created 
                  by the Safari production group (John Chodacki, Becki Maisch, 
                  and Madeleine Newell) using a set of Frame-to-XML conversion 
                  and cleanup tools written and maintained by Erik Ray, Benn 
                  Salter, John Chodacki, and Jeff Liggett.</P>
