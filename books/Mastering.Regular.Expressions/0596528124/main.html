manipulating text and data. They are now standard features
in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including
Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB.NET and C# (and any language
using the .NET Framework), PHP, and MySQL. <br>
		</p><p class="docText"><br>
If you don't use regular expressions yet, you will discover
in this book a whole new world of mastery over your data. If
you already use them, you'll appreciate this book's
unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage. If you think
you know all you need to know about regular<br>
expressions, this book is a stunning
eye-opener.</p><br>
		<p class="docText"><br>
As this book shows, a command of regular expressions is an
invaluable skill. Regular expressions allow you to code
complex and subtle text processing that you never<br>
imagined could be automated. Regular expressions can save
you time and aggravation. They can be used to craft elegant
solutions to a wide range of problems. Once you've mastered
regular expressions, they'll become an invaluable part of
your toolkit. You will wonder how you ever got by without
them.</p><br>
		<p class="docText"><br>
Yet despite their wide availability, flexibility, and
unparalleled power, regular expressions are frequently
underutilized. Yet what is power in the hands of an expert
can be fraught with peril for the unwary.
<span class="docEmphasis">Mastering Regular Expressions</span> will help
you navigate the minefield to becoming an expert and help
you optimize your use of regular expressions. </p><br>
		<p class="docText"><br>
			<span class="docEmphasis">Mastering Regular Expressions</span>, Third
Edition, now includes a full chapter devoted to PHP and its
powerful and expressive suite of regular expression
functions, in addition to enhanced PHP coverage in the
central "core" chapters. Furthermore, this edition has been
updated throughout to reflect advances in other languages,
including expanded in-depth coverage of Sun's
<span class="docEmphasis">java.util.regex</span> package, which has
emerged as the standard Java regex implementation.Topics
include:</p><br>
		<ul><li><p class="docList">A comparison of features among different
versions of many<br>
languages and tools</p></li><li><p class="docList">How the regular expression engine
works</p></li><li><p class="docList">Optimization (major savings available
here!)</p></li><li><p class="docList">Matching just what you want, but not what
you don't want</p></li><li><p class="docList">Sections and chapters on individual
languages</p></li></ul><p class="docText"><br>
Written in the lucid, entertaining tone that makes a
complex, dry topic become crystal-clear to programmers, and
sprinkled with solutions to complex real-world problems,
<span class="docEmphasis">Mastering Regular Expressions</span>, Third
Edition offers a wealth information that you can put to
