About the Author
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Jeffrey E. F. Friedl</span> was raised in the countryside of Rootstown, Ohio, and had aspi-rations of being an astronomer until one day noticing a TRS-80 Model I sitting unused in the corner of the chem lab (bristling with a <span class="docEmphasis">full</span> 16K of RAM, no less).</P>
<p class="docText">He eventually began using Unix (and regular expressions) in 1980. With degrees in Computer Science from Kent (BS) and the University of New Hampshire (MS), he did kernel development for Omron Corporation in Kyoto, Japan, for eight years before moving to Silicon Valley in 1997 to apply his regular-expression know-how to financial news and data for a little-known company called Yahoo!. He returned to Kyoto with his wife and son in April 2004.</P>
<p class="docText">When faced with the daunting task of filling his copious free time, Jeffrey enjoys spending time with his wife, Fumie, and their three-year-old bundle of energy, Anthony. He also enjoys photographing the abundant beauty of Kyoto, the results of which he often posts to his blog, <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://regex.info/blog">http://regex.info/blog</a>.</P>
