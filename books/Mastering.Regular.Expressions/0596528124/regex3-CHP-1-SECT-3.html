<p class="docText">As we'll soon see, complete regular expressions are built up from small building-block units. Each individual building block is quite simple, but since they can be combined in an infinite number of ways, knowing how to combine them to achieve a particular goal takes some experience. So, this chapter provides a quick overview of some regular-expression concepts. It doesn't go into much depth, but provides a basis for the rest of this book to build on, and sets the stage for important side issues that are best discussed before we delve too deeply into the regular expressions themselves.</P>
<p class="docText">While some examples may seem silly (because some <span class="docEmphasis">are</span> silly), they represent the kind of tasks that you will want to do  you just might not realize it yet. If each point doesn't seem to make sense, don't worry too much. Just let the gist of the lessons sink in. That's the goal of this chapter.</P>

<h4 id="title-IDA5TOIS" class="docSection2Title">1.3.1. If You Have Some Regular-Expression Experience</H4>
<p class="docText">If you're already familiar with regular expressions, much of this overview will not be new, but please be sure to at least glance over it anyway. Although you may be aware of the basic meaning of certain metacharacters, perhaps some of the ways of thinking about and looking at regular expressions will be new.</p>
<p class="docText">Just as there is a difference between playing a musical piece well and <span class="docEmphasis">making music</span>, there is a difference between knowing about regular expressions and <span class="docEmphasis">really understanding</span> them. Some of the lessons present the same information that you are already familiar with, but in ways that may be new and which are the first steps to <span class="docEmphasis">really understanding</span>.</p>

<p class="docText">Finding text is one of the simplest uses of regular expressionsmany text editors and word processors allow you to search a document using a regular-expression pattern. Even simpler is the utility <span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span>. Give <span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span> a regular expression and some files to search, and it attempts to match the regular expression to each line of each file, displaying only those lines in which a match is found. <span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span> is freely available for many systems, including DOS,<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0074"></a> 
 MacOS, Windows, Unix, and so on. See this book's web site, <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://regex.info">http://regex.info</a>, for links on how to obtain a copy of <span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span> for your system.</p>
<p class="docText">Returning to the email example from page 3, the command I actually used to generate a makeshift table of contents from the email file is shown in <a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-1-FIG-1">Figure 1-1</a>. <span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span> interprets the first command-line argument as a regular expression, and any remaining arguments as the file(s) to search. Note, however, that the single quotes shown in <a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-1-FIG-1">Figure 1-1</a> are <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> part of the regular expression, but are needed by my command shell.<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0075"></a> 
<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-1-FN-3">[<img src=images/U2020.jpg border=0>]</a></sup> When using <span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span>, I usually wrap the regular expression with single quotes. Exactly which characters are special, in what contexts, to whom (to the regular-expression, or to the tool), and in what order they are interpreted are all issues that grow in importance when you move to regular-expression use in fullfledged programming languagessomething we'll see starting in the next chapter.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="regex3-CHP-1-FN-3">[<img src=images/U2020.jpg border=0>]</a></sup> The command shell is the part of the system that accepts your typed commands and actually executes the programs you request. With the shell I use, the single quotes serve to group the command argument, telling the shell not to pay too much attention to what's inside. If I didn't use them, the shell might think, for example, a '<tt>*</tt>' that I intended to be part of the regular expression was really part of a filename pattern that <span class="docEmphasis">it</span> should interpret. I don't want that to happen, so I use the quotes to "hide" the metacharacters from the shell. Windows users of COMMAND.COM<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0076"></a> 
 or CMD.EXE should probably use double quotes instead.</P></blockquote>

<p class="docText">We'll start to analyze just what the various parts of the regex mean in a moment, but you can probably already guess just by looking that some of the characters have special meanings. In this case, the parentheses, the <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>^</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0>, and the <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>|</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> characters are regular-expression metacharacters, and combine with the other characters to generate the result I want.</p>
<p class="docText">On the other hand, if your regular expression doesn't use any of the dozen or so metacharacters that <span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span> understands, it effectively becomes a simple "plain text" search. For example, searching for <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>cat</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> in a file finds and displays all lines with the three letters <tt>c&#183;a&#183;t</tt> in a row. This includes, for example, any line containing <tt>va</tt><img border="0" alt="" id="195131084202" width="23" height="12" SRC="images/regex3_u0106.jpg"><tt>ion</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText">Even though the line might not have the <span class="docEmphasis">word</span> <tt>cat</tt>, the <tt>c&#183;a&#183;t</tt> sequence in <tt>vacation</tt> is still enough to be matched. Since it's there, <span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span> goes ahead and displays the whole line. The key point is that regular-expression searching is not done on a "word" basis<span class="docEmphasis">egrep</span> can understand the concept of bytes and lines in a file, but it generally has no idea of English's (or any other language's) words, sentences, paragraphs, or other high-level concepts.</p>
