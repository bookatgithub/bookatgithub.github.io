<p class="docText">With the regex-directed nature of an NFA engine, as is found in Perl, Java packages, the .NET languages, Python, and PHP (just to name a few; see the table on page 145 for more), subtle changes in an expression can have major effects on what or how it matches. Issues that don't matter with a DFA engine become paramount. The fine control an NFA engine affords allows you to really <span class="docEmphasis">craft</span> an expression, although it can sometimes be a source of confusion to the unaware. This chapter helps you learn this art.</P>
<p class="docText">At stake are both correctness and efficiency: matching just what you want and no more, and doing it quickly. <a class="docLink" href="regex3-CHP-4.html#regex3-CHP-4">Chapters 4</a> and <a class="docLink" href="regex3-CHP-5.html#regex3-CHP-5">5</a> examined correctness; here we'll look at the efficiency-related issues of NFA engines, and how to make them work to our advantage. (DFA-related issues are mentioned when appropriate, but this chapter is primarily concerned with NFA-based engines.) In a nutshell, the key is to understand the full implications of backtracking, and to learn techniques to avoid it where possible. Armed with the detailed understanding of the processing mechanics, not only will you maximize the speed of matches, you will also be able to write more complex expressions with confidence.</P>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">In This Chapter</span> To arm you well, this chapter first illustrates just how important these issues can be, then prepares you for some of the more advanced techniques presented later by reviewing the basic backtracking described in the previous chapters with a strong emphasis on efficiency and backtracking's global ramifications. Then we'll look at some of the common internal optimizations that can have a fairly substantial impact on efficiency, and on how expressions are best written for implementations that employ them. Finally, I bring it all together with some killer techniques to construct lightning-fast NFA regexes.</p>

<p class="docText">The examples we'll see here illustrate common situations you might meet when using regular expressions. When examining a particular example's efficiency,<a name="IDX-CHP-6-1767"></a> 
 I'll sometimes report the number of individual tests that the regex engine does during the course of a match. For example, in matching <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>marty</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> against <tt>smarty</tt>, there are six individual tests  the initial attempt of <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>m</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> against <tt>s</tt> (which fails), then the matching of <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>m</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> against <tt>m</tt>, <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>a</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> against <tt>a</tt>, and so on. I also often report the number of backtracks (zero in this example, although the implicit backtrack by the regex engine's transmission to retry the regex at the second character position could be counted as one).</P>
<p class="docText">I use these exact numbers not because the precision is important, but rather to be more concrete than words such as "lots," "few," "many," "better," "not too much," and so forth. I don't want to imply that using regular expressions with an NFA is an exercise in counting<a name="IDX-CHP-6-1768"></a> 
 tests or backtracks; I just want to acquaint you with the relative qualities of the examples.</p>
<p class="docText">Another important thing to realize is that these "precise" numbers probably differ from tool to tool. It's the basic relative performance of the examples that I hope will stay with you. One important variation among tools is the optimizations they might employ. A smart enough implementation completely bypasses the application of a particular regex if it can decide beforehand that the target string cannot possibly match (in cases, for instance, when the string lacks a particular character that the engine knows beforehand must be there for any match to be successful). I discuss these important optimizations in this chapter, but the overall lessons are generally more important than the specific special cases.</p>

<H5 id="title-IDAL5MNF" class="docSection3Title">6.1.1.2. Traditional NFA versus POSIX NFA</H5>
<p class="docText">It's important to keep in mind the target tool's engine type, Traditional NFA or POSIX NFA, when analyzing efficiency. As we'll see in the next section, some concerns matter to one but not the other. Sometimes a change that has no effect on one has a great effect on the other. Again, understanding the basics allows you to judge each situation as it arises.</P>
