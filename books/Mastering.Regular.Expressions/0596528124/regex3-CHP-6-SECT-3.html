<p class="docText">On a local level, backtracking is simply the return to attempt an untried option. That's simple enough to understand, but the global implications of backtracking are not as easily grasped. In this section, we'll take an explicit look at the details of backtracking, both during a match and during a non-match, and we'll try to make some sense out of the patterns we see emerge.</P>
<p class="docText">Let's start by looking closely at some examples from the previous chapters. From page 165, if we apply <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>".*"</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> to</P>

<p class="docText">we can visualize the matching action as shown in <a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-6-FIG-3">Figure 6-3</a>.</P>

<h5 class="docFigureTitle">Figure 6-3. Successful match of <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>".* "</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0></H5><img border="0" alt="" id="195131084199" width="476" height="226" SRC="images/regex3_0603.jpg"></center></P><br>
<p class="docText">The regex is attempted starting at each string position in turn, but because the initial quote fails immediately, nothing interesting happens until the attempt starting at the location marked <span class="docEmphStrong">A</span>. At this point, the rest of the expression is attempted, but the transmission<a name="IDX-CHP-6-1796"></a> 
 (&#9758; 148) knows that if the attempt turns out to be a dead end, the full regex can still be tried at the next position.</p>
<p class="docText">The <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>.*</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> then matches to the end of the string, where the dot is unable to match the nothingness at the end of the string and so the star finally stops. None of the 46 characters matched by <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>.*</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> is required, so while matching them, the engine accumulated 46 more situations to where it can backtrack if it turns out that it matched too much. Now that <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>.*</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> has stopped, the engine backtracks to the last of those saved states, the "try <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>".*<sub><img src=images/U22CF.jpg border=0></sub>"</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> at &#8943;<tt><span class="docEmphStrong">anese</span><sub><img src=images/U22CF.jpg border=0></sub></tt>" state.</P>
<p class="docText">This means that we try to match the closing quote at the end of the string. Well, aquote can match nothingness no better than dot, so this fails too. The engine backtracks again, this time trying to match the closing quote at &#8943;<tt>Japanes<sub><img src=images/U22CF.jpg border=0></sub>e</tt>, which also fails.</P>
<p class="docText">The remembered states accumulated while matching from <span class="docEmphStrong">A</span> to <span class="docEmphStrong">B</span> are tried in reverse (latest first) order as we move from <span class="docEmphStrong">B</span> to <span class="docEmphStrong">C</span>. After trying only about a dozen of them, the state that represents "try <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>".*<sub><img src=images/U22CF.jpg border=0></sub>"</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> at &#8943;<tt><span class="docEmphStrong">arudo</span><sub><img src=images/U22CF.jpg border=0></sub>"&#8226;<span class="docEmphStrong">in</span>&#8226;<span class="docEmphStrong">Japa</span></tt>&#8943;" is reached, point <span class="docEmphStrong">C</span>. This <span class="docEmphasis">can</span> match, bringing us to <span class="docEmphStrong">D</span> and an overall match:</P><img border="0" alt="" id="195131084199" width="453" height="13" SRC="images/regex3_u0606.jpg">
<p class="docText">If this is a Traditional NFA, the remaining unused states are simply discarded and the successful match is reported.</p>

<H4 id="title-IDAQZWJN" class="docSection2Title">6.3.1. More Work for a POSIX NFA</H4>
<a name="IDX-CHP-6-1797"></a> 
<a name="IDX-CHP-6-1798"></a> 

<p class="docText">For POSIX NFA, the match noted earlier is remembered as "the longest match we've seen so far," but all remaining states must still be explored to see whether they could come up with a longer match. We know this won't happen in this case, but the regex engine must find that out for itself.</p>
<p class="docText">So, the states are tried and immediately discarded except for the remaining two situations where there is a quote in the string available to match the final quote. Thus, the sequences <span class="docEmphStrong">D</span>-<span class="docEmphStrong">E</span>-<span class="docEmphStrong">F</span> and <span class="docEmphStrong">F</span>-<span class="docEmphStrong">G</span>-<span class="docEmphStrong">H</span> are similar to <span class="docEmphStrong">B</span>-<span class="docEmphStrong">C</span>-<span class="docEmphStrong">D</span>, except the matches at <span class="docEmphStrong">F</span> and <span class="docEmphStrong">H</span> are discarded as being shorter than a previously found match at <span class="docEmphStrong">D</span></p>
<p class="docText">By <span class="docEmphStrong">I</span>, the only remaining backtrack is the "bump along and retry" one. However, since the attempt starting at <span class="docEmphStrong">A</span> <span class="docEmphasis">was</span> able to find a match (three in fact), the POSIX NFA engine is finally done and the match at <span class="docEmphStrong">D</span> is reported.</p>

<a name="regex3-CHP-6-SECT-3.2"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAG2WJN" class="docSection2Title">6.3.2. Work Required During a Non-Match</H4>
<p class="docText">We still need to look at what happens when there is no match. Let's look at <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>".*"<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084199" width="7" height="12" SRC="images/regex3_u0607.jpg"></tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0>. We know this won't match our example text, but it comes close on a number of occasions throughout the match attempt. As we'll see, that results in much more work.</p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-6-FIG-4">Figure 6-4</a> illustrates this work. The <span class="docEmphStrong">A</span>-<span class="docEmphStrong">I</span> sequence looks similar to that in <a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-6-FIG-3">Figure 6-3</a>. One difference is that this time it does not match at point <span class="docEmphStrong">D</span> (because the ending exclamation point can't match). Another difference is that the entire sequence in <a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-6-FIG-4">Figure 6-4</a> applies to both Traditional and POSIX NFA engines: finding no match, the Traditional NFA must try as many possibilities as the POSIX NFAall of them.</p>

<p class="docText">Since there is no match from the overall attempt starting at <span class="docEmphStrong">A</span> and ending at <span class="docEmphStrong">I</span>, the transmission bumps along to retry the match. Attempts eventually starting at points <span class="docEmphStrong">J</span>, <span class="docEmphStrong">Q</span>, and <span class="docEmphStrong">V</span> look promising, but fail similarly to the attempt at <span class="docEmphStrong">A</span>. Finally at <span class="docEmphStrong">Y</span>, there are no more positions for the transmission to try from, so the overall attempt fails. As <a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-6-FIG-4">Figure 6-4</a> shows, it took a fair amount of work to find this out.</p>

<p class="docText">As a comparison, let's replace the dot with <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>[^"]</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0>. As discussed in the previous chapter, this gives less surprising results because it is more specific, and the end result is that with it, the new regex is more efficient to boot. With <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt><span class="docEmphStrong">[^"]*"!</span></tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0>, the <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>[^"]*</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> can't get past the closing quote, eliminating much matching and subsequent backtracking.</p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-6-FIG-5">Figure 6-5</a> shows the failing attempt (compare to <a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-6-FIG-4">Figure 6-4</a>). As you can see, much less backtracking is needed. If the different results suit your needs, the reduced backtracking is a welcome side effect.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDADBXJN" class="docSection2Title">6.3.4. Alternation Can Be Expensive</h4>
<p class="docText">Alternation can be a leading cause of backtracking. As a simple example, let's use our <tt>makudonarudo</tt> test string to compare how <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>u|v|w|x|y|z</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> and <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>[uvwxyz]</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> go about matching. A character class is usually a simple test,<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#regex3-CHP-6-FN-3">[<img src=images/U2020.jpg border=0>]</a></sup> so <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>[uvwxyz]</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0> suffers only the bump-along backtracks (34 of them) until we match at:</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="regex3-CHP-6-FN-3">[<img src=images/U2020.jpg border=0>]</a></sup> Some implementations are not as efficient as others, but it's safe to assume that a class is always faster than the equivalent alternation.</P></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText"><tt>The name "McDonald's" is said "mak<img border="0" alt="" id="195131084199" width="8" height="10" SRC="images/regex3_u0608.jpg">donarudo" in Japanese</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">With <img src=images/U2308.jpg border=0><tt>u|v|w|x|y|z</tt><img src=images/U230B.jpg border=0>, however, six backtracks are required at each starting position, eventually totaling 204 before we achieve the same match. Obviously, not every alternation is replaceable, and even when it is, it's not necessarily as easily as with this example. In some situations, however, certain techniques that we'll look at later can greatly reduce the amount of alternation-related backtracking required for a match.</P>
<p class="docText">Understanding backtracking is perhaps the most important facet of NFA efficiency, but it's still only part of the equation. A regex engine's optimizations can <span class="docEmphasis">greatly</span> improve efficiency. Later in this chapter, we'll look in detail at what a regex engine needs to do, and how it can optimize its performance.</p>
