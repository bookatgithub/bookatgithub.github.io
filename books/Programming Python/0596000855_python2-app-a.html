<A NAME="IXT-A-336625"></A>This
appendix summarizes prominent changes introduced in Python releases
since the first edition of this book. It is divided into three
sections, mostly because the sections on 1.6 and 2.0 changes were
adapted from release note documents:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">Changes introduced in Python 2.0 (and 2.1)</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Changes introduced in Python 1.6</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Changes between the first edition and Python 1.5.2 </P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Python 1.3 was the most recent release when the first edition was
published (October 1996), and Python 1.6 and 2.0 were released just
before this second edition was finished. 1.6 was the last release
posted by CNRI, and 2.0 was released from BeOpen (Guido's two
employers prior to his move to Digital Creations); 2.0 adds a handful
of features to 1.6.
</P>

<P class="docText">With a few notable exceptions, the changes over the last five years
have introduced new features to Python, but have not changed it in
incompatible ways. Many of the new features are widely useful (e.g.,
module packages), but some seem to address the whims of Python gurus
(e.g., list comprehensions) and can be safely ignored by anyone else.
In any event, although it is important to keep in touch with Python
evolution, you should not take this appendix too seriously. Frankly,
application library and tool usage is much more important in practice
than obscure language additions.
</P>

<P class="docText">For information on the Python changes that will surely occur after
this edition's publication, consult either the resources I
maintain at this book's web site (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://rmi.net/~lutz/about-pp.html">http://rmi.net/~lutz/about-pp.html</A>), the
resources available at Python's web site (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A> ), or the release notes
that accompany Python releases.
