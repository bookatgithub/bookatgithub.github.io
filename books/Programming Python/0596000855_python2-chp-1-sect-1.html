<P class="docText">This book is about using Python, a very high-level, object-oriented,
open source<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[1]</A></sup> programming
language, designed to optimize development speed. Although it is
completely general-purpose, Python is often called an object-oriented
<span class="docEmphasis">scripting language</span>, partly because of its sheer
ease of use, and partly because it is commonly used to orchestrate or
"glue" other software components in an application.
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[1]</A></sup> Open source systems are sometimes called
<span class="docEmphasis">freeware</span>, in that their source code is freely
distributed and community-controlled. Don't let that concept
fool you, though; with roughly half a million users in that community
today, Python is very well supported.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">If you are new to Python, chances are you've heard about the
language somewhere, but are not quite sure what it is about. To help
you get started, this chapter provides a nontechnical introduction to
Python's features and roles. Most of it will make more sense
once you have seen real Python programs, but let's first take a
quick pass over the forest before wandering among the trees.
</P>

<P class="docText">In the preface, I mentioned that Python emphasizes concepts such as
quality, productivity, portability, and integration. Since these four
terms summarize most of the reasons for using Python, I'd like
to define them in a bit more detail:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Quality</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Python makes it easy to write software that can be reused and
maintained. It was deliberately designed to raise development quality
expectations in the scripting world. Python's clear syntax and
coherent design almost forces programmers to write readable
code -- a critical feature for software that may be changed by
others. The Python language really does look like it was designed,
not accumulated. Python is also well tooled for modern software reuse
methodologies. In fact, writing high-quality Python components that
may be applied in multiple contexts is almost automatic.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Productivity</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Python is optimized for speed of development. It's easy to
write programs fast in Python, because the interpreter handles
details you must code explicitly in lower-level languages. Things
like type declarations, memory management, and build procedures are
nowhere to be found in Python scripts. But fast initial development
is only one component of productivity. In the real world, programmers
must write code both for a computer to execute and for other
programmers to read and maintain. Because Python's syntax
resembles <span class="docEmphasis">executable pseudocode</span>, it yields
programs that are easy to understand long after they have been
written. In addition, Python supports (but does not impose) advanced
paradigms such as object-oriented programming, which further boost
developer productivity and shrink development schedules.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Portability</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Most Python programs run without change on almost every computer
system in use today. In fact, Python programs run today on everything
from IBM mainframes and Cray Supercomputers to notebook PCs and
handheld PDAs. Although some platforms offer nonportable extensions,
the core Python language and libraries are platform-neutral. For
instance, most Python scripts developed on Linux will generally run
on Windows immediately, and vice versa -- simply copy the script
over. Moreover, a graphical user interface (GUI) program written with
Python's standard Tkinter library will run on the X Windows
system, Microsoft Windows, and the Macintosh, with native
look-and-feel on each, and without modifying the program's
source code at all.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Integration</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Python is designed to be integrated with other tools. Programs
written in Python can be easily mixed with and
<span class="docEmphasis">script</span> (i.e., direct) other components of a
system. Today, for example, Python scripts can call out to existing C
and C++ libraries, talk to Java classes, integrate with COM and CORBA
components, and more. In addition, programs written in other
languages can just as easily run Python scripts by calling C and Java
API functions, accessing Python-coded COM servers, and so on. Python
is not a closed box.
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">In an era of increasingly short development schedules, faster
machines, and heterogeneous applications, these strengths have proven
to be powerful allies in both small and large development projects.
Naturally, there are other aspects of Python that attract developers,
such as its simple learning curve for developers and users alike,
libraries of precoded tools to minimize up-front development, and
completely free nature that cuts product development and deployment
costs.
</P>

<P class="docText">But Python's productivity focus is perhaps its most attractive
and defining quality. As I write this, the main problem facing the
software development world is not just writing programs quickly, but
finding developers with time to write programs at all.
Developers' time has become paramount -- much more critical
than execution speed. There are simply more projects than programmers
to staff them.
</P>

<P class="docText">As a language optimized for developer productivity, Python seems to
be the right answer to the questions being asked by the development
world. Not only can Python developers implement systems quickly, but
the resulting systems will be maintainable, portable, and easily
integrated with other application components.
