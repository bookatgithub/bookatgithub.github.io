<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-1-336930"></A><A NAME="IXT-1-336931"></A>Python was invented around 1990 by Guido
van Rossum, when he was at CWI in Amsterdam. Despite the reptiles, it
is named after the BBC comedy series <span class="docEmphasis">Monty Python's
Flying Circus</span>, of which Guido is a fan (see the following
silly sidebar). Guido was also involved with the Amoeba distributed
operating system and the ABC language. In fact, the original
motivation for Python was to create an advanced scripting language
for the Amoeba system.
</P>

<P class="docText">But Python's design turned out to be general enough to address
a wide variety of domains. It's now used by hundreds of
thousands of engineers around the world, in increasingly diverse
roles. Companies use Python today in commercial products, for tasks
such as testing chips and boards, developing GUIs, searching the Web,
animating movies, scripting games, serving up maps and email on the
Internet, customizing C++ class libraries, and much more.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[2]</A></sup> In
fact, because Python is a completely general-purpose language, its
target domains are only limited by the scope of computers in general.
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[2]</A></sup> See the preface for more examples of companies using Python in
these ways, and see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A> for a more
comprehensive list of commercial applications.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Since it first appeared on the public domain scene in 1991, Python
has continued to attract a loyal following, and spawned a dedicated
Internet newsgroup, <span class="docEmphasis">comp.lang.python</span>, in 1994.
And as the first edition of this book was being written in 1995,
Python's home page debuted on the WWW at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A> -- still the
official place to find all things Python.

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">What's in a Name?</H2>

<P class="docText">Python gets its name from the 1970s British TV comedy series,
<span class="docEmphasis">Monty Python's Flying Circus</span>. According to
Python folklore, Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, was
watching reruns of the show at about the same time he needed a name
for a new language he was developing. And, as they say in show
business, "the rest is history."
</P>

<P class="docText">Because of this heritage, references to the comedy group's work
often show up in examples and discussion. For instance, the name
"Spam" has a special connotation to Python users, and
confrontations are sometimes referred to as "The Spanish
Inquisition." As a rule, if a Python user starts using phrases
that have no relation to reality, they're probably borrowed
from the Monty Python series or movies. Some of these phrases might
even pop up in this book. You don't have to run out and rent
<span class="docEmphasis">The Meaning of Life</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">The Holy
Grail</span> to do useful work in Python, of course, but it
can't hurt.
</P>

<P class="docText">While "Python" turned out to be a distinctive name,
it's also had some interesting side effects. For instance, when
the Python newsgroup, <span class="docEmphasis">comp.lang.python</span>, came online in 1994, its
first few weeks of activity were almost entirely taken up by people
wanting to discuss topics from the TV show. More recently, a special
Python supplement in the <span class="docEmphasis">Linux Journal</span> magazine
featured photos of Guido garbed in an obligatory "nice red
uniform."
</P>

<P class="docText">There's still an occasional post from fans of the show on
Python's news list. For instance, one poster innocently offered
to swap Monty Python scripts with other fans. Had he known the nature
of the forum, he might have at least mentioned whether they ran under
DOS or Unix.

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-1-336932"></A><A NAME="IXT-1-336933"></A>To help manage Python's
growth, organizations aimed at supporting Python developers have
taken shape over the years: among them, Python Software Activity
(PSA) was formed to help facilitate Python conferences and web sites,
and the Python Consortium was formed by organizations interested in
helping to foster Python's growth. Although the future of the
PSA is unclear as I write these words, it has helped to support
Python through the early years.
</P>

<P class="docText">Today, Guido and a handful of other key Python developers, are
employed by a company named Digital Creations to do Python
development on a full-time basis. Digital Creations, based in
Virginia, is also home to the Python-based Zope web application
toolkit (see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.zope.org/default.htm">http://www.zope.org</A>). However, the Python language is owned and managed by
an independent body, and remains a true open source, community-driven
system.
</P>

<P class="docText">Other companies have Python efforts underway as well. For instance,
ActiveState and PythonWare develop Python tools, O'Reilly (the
publisher of this book) and a company named Foretech both organize
annual Python conferences, and O'Reilly manages a supplemental
Python web site (see the O'Reilly Network's Python
DevCenter at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.oreillynet.com/python">http://www.oreillynet.com/python</A>). The
O'Reilly Python Conference is held as part of the annual Open
Source Software Convention. Although the world of professional
organizations and companies changes more frequently than do published
books, it seems certain that the Python language will continue to
meet the needs of its user community.
