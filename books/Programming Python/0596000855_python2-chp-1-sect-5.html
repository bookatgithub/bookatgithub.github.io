<H3 class="docSection1Title">1.5 What's Python Not Good For?</H3>

<P class="docText">To be fair again, some tasks are outside of Python's scope.
Like all dynamic languages, Python (as currently implemented)
isn't as fast or efficient as static, compiled languages like
C. In many domains, the difference doesn't matter; for programs
that spend most of their time interacting with users or transferring
data over networks, Python is usually more than adequate to meet the
performance needs of the entire application. But efficiency is still
a priority in some domains.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-1-336935"></A><A NAME="IXT-1-336936"></A>Because
it is interpreted today,<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[3]</A></sup> Python alone usually isn't the best
tool for delivery of performance-critical components. Instead,
computationally intensive operations can be implemented as compiled
<span class="docEmphasis">extensions</span> to Python, and coded in a low-level
language like C. Python can't be used as the sole
implementation language for such components, but it works well as a
frontend scripting interface to them.
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[3]</A></sup> Python is
"interpreted" in the same way that Java is: Python source
code is automatically compiled (translated) to an intermediate form
called "bytecode," which is then executed by the Python
virtual machine (that is, the Python runtime system). This makes
Python scripts more portable and faster than a pure interpreter that
runs raw source code or trees. But it also makes Python slower than
true compilers that translate source code to binary machine code for
the local CPU. Keep in mind, though, that some of these details are
specific to the standard Python implementation; the JPython (a.k.a.
"Jython") port compiles Python scripts to Java bytecode,
and the new C#/.NET port compiles Python scripts to binary
.<I>exe</I> files. An optimizing Python compiler might
make most of the performance cautions in this chapter invalid (we can
hope). </p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">For example, numerical programming and image processing support has
been added to Python by combining optimized extensions with a Python
language interface. In such a system, once the optimized extensions
have been developed, most of the programming occurs at the
higher-level Python scripting level. The net result is a numerical
programming tool that's both efficient and easy to use.
</P>

<P class="docText">Moreover, Python can still serve as a prototyping tool in such
domains. Systems may be implemented in Python first, and later moved
in whole or piecemeal to a language like C for delivery. C and Python
have distinct strengths and roles; a hybrid approach, using C for
compute-intensive modules, and Python for prototyping and frontend
interfaces, can leverage the benefits of both.
</P>

<P class="docText">In some sense, Python solves the efficiency/flexibility tradeoff by
not solving it at all. It provides a language optimized for ease of
use, along with tools needed to integrate with other languages. By
combining components written in Python and compiled languages like C
and C++, developers may select an appropriate mix of usability and
performance for each particular application. While it's
unlikely that it will ever be as fast as C, Python's speed of
development is at least as important as C's speed of execution
in most modern software projects.

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">On Truth in Advertising</H2>

<P class="docText">In this book's conclusion we will return to some of the bigger
ideas introduced in this chapter, after we've had a chance to
study Python in action. I want to point out up front, though, that my
background is in Computer Science, not marketing. I plan to be
brutally honest in this book, both about Python's features and
its downsides. Despite the fact that Python is one of the most
easy-to-use programming languages ever created, there are indeed some
pitfalls, which we will examine in this book.
</P>

<P class="docText">Let's start now. Perhaps the biggest pitfall you should know
about is this one: <span class="docEmphasis">Python makes it incredibly easy to throw
together a bad design quickly</span>. It's a genuine
problem. Because developing programs in Python is so simple and fast
compared to traditional languages, it's easy to get wrapped up
in the act of programming itself, and pay less attention to the
problem you are really trying to solve.
</P>

<P class="docText">In fact, Python can be downright seductive -- so much so that you
may need to consciously resist the temptation to quickly implement a
program in Python that works, and is arguably "cool," but
leaves you as far from a maintainable implementation of your original
conception as you were when you started. The natural delays built in
to compiled language development -- fixing compiler error
messages, linking libraries, and the like -- aren't there to
apply the brakes in Python work.
</P>

<P class="docText">This isn't necessarily all bad. In most cases, the early
designs that you throw together fast are stepping stones to better
designs that you later keep. But be warned: even with a rapid
development language like Python, <span class="docEmphasis">there is no substitute
for</span> <span class="docEmphasis">brains  --</span> it's always
best to think before you start typing code. To date, at least, no
computer programing language has managed to make intelligence
obsolete.
