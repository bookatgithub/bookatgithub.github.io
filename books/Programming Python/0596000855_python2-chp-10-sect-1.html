<H3 class="docSection1Title">10.1 "Tune in, Log on, and Drop out"</H3>

<P class="docText">In the last few years, the Internet has virtually exploded onto the
mainstream stage. It has rapidly grown from a simple communication
device used primarily by academics and researchers into a medium that
is now nearly as pervasive as the television and telephone. Social
observers have likened the Internet's cultural impact to that
of the printing press, and technical observers have suggested that
all new software development of interest occurs only on the Internet.
Naturally, time will be the final arbiter for such claims, but there
is little doubt that the Internet is a major force in society, and
one of the main application contexts for modern software systems.
</P>

<P class="docText">The Internet also happens to be one of the primary application
domains for the Python programming language. Given Python and a
computer with a socket-based Internet connection, we can write Python
scripts to read and send email around the world, fetch web pages from
remote sites, transfer files by FTP, program interactive web sites,
parse HTML and XML files, and much more, simply by using the Internet
modules that ship with Python as standard tools.
</P>

<P class="docText">In fact, companies all over the world do: Yahoo, Infoseek,
Hewlett-Packard, and many others rely on Python's standard
tools to power their commercial web sites. Many also build and manage
their sites with the Zope web application server, which is itself
written and customizable in Python. Others use Python to script Java
web applications with JPython (a.k.a. "Jython") -- a
system that compiles Python programs to Java bytecode, and exports
Java libraries for use in Python
scripts.<A NAME="IXT-10-337086"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-10-337087"></A>
</P>

<P class="docText">As the Internet has grown, so too has Python's role as an
Internet tool. Python has proven to be well-suited to Internet
scripting for some of the very same reasons that make it ideal in
other domains. Its modular design and rapid turnaround mix well with
the intense demands of Internet development. In this part of the
book, we'll find that Python does more than simply support
Internet scripts; it also fosters qualities such as productivity and
maintainability that are essential to Internet projects of all shapes
and sizes.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.1.1 Internet Scripting Topics</H4>

<P class="docText">Internet programming entails many topics, so to make the presentation
easier to digest, I've split this subject over the next six
chapters of this book. This chapter introduces Internet fundamentals
and explores sockets, the underlying communications mechanism of the
Internet. From there, later chapters move on to discuss the client,
the server, web site construction, and more advanced topics.
</P>

<P class="docText">Each chapter assumes you've read the previous one, but you can
generally skip around, especially if you have any experience in the
Internet domain. Since these chapters represent a big portion (about
a third) of this book at large, the following sections go into a few
more details about what we'll be studying.

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-10-337088"></A>In conceptual

multiple functional layers:

</DL>

<P class="docText">In this chapter and <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-11.html#python2-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A>, our main focus is
on programming the second and third layers: sockets and higher-level
protocols. We'll start this chapter at the bottom, learning
about the socket model of network programming. Sockets aren't
strictly tied to Internet scripting, but they are presented here
because this is their primary role. As we'll see, most of what
happens on the Internet happens through sockets, whether you notice
or not.
</P>

<P class="docText">After introducing sockets, the next chapter makes its way up to
Python's client-side interfaces to higher-level
protocols -- things like email and FTP transfers, which run on top
of sockets. It turns out that a lot can be done with Python on the
client alone, and <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-11.html#python2-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A> will sample the flavor
of Python client-side scripting. The next three chapters then go on
to present server-side scripting (programs that run on a server
computer and are usually invoked by a web browser). Finally, the last
chapter in this part, <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>, briefly
introduces even higher-level tools such as JPython and Zope.
</P>

<P class="docText">Along the way, we will also put to work some of the operating-system
and GUI interfaces we've studied earlier (e.g., processes,
threads, signals, and Tkinter), and investigate some of the design
choices and challenges that the Internet presents.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-10-337094"></A>That
last statement merits a few more words. Internet scripting, like
GUIs, is one of the sexier application domains for Python. As in GUI
work, there is an intangible but instant gratification in seeing a
Python Internet program ship information all over the world. On the
other hand, by its very nature, network programming imposes speed
overheads and user interface limitations. Though it may not be a
fashionable stance these days, some applications are still better off
not being deployed on the Net. In this part of the book, we will take
an honest look at the Net's trade-offs as they arise.
</P>

<P class="docText">The Internet is also considered by many to be something of an
ultimate proof of concept for open source tools. Indeed, much of the
Net runs on top of a large number of tools, such as Python, Perl, the
Apache web server, the sendmail program, and Linux. Moreover, new
tools and technologies for programming the Web sometimes seem to
appear faster than developers can absorb.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-10-337095"></A>The good news is that Python's
integration focus makes it a natural in such a heterogeneous world.
Today, Python programs can be installed as client-side and
server-side tools, embedded within HTML code, used as applets and
servlets in Java applications, mixed into distributed object systems
like CORBA and DCOM, integrated with XML-coded objects, and more. In
more general terms, the rationale for using Python in the Internet
domain is exactly the same as in any other: Python's emphasis
on productivity, portability, and integration make it ideal for
writing Internet programs that are open, maintainable, and delivered
according to the ever-shrinking schedules in this field.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-10-SECT-1.1.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.1.1.2 What we won't cover</H5>

<P class="docText">Now that I've told you what we will cover in this book, I
should also mention what we won't cover. Like Tkinter, the
Internet is a large domain, and this part of the book is mostly an
introduction to core concepts and representative tasks, not an
exhaustive reference. There are simply too many Python Internet
modules to include each in this text, but the examples here should
help you understand the library manual entries for modules we
don't have time to cover.
</P>

<P class="docText">I also want to point out that higher-level tools like JPython and
Zope are large systems in their own right, and they are best dealt
with in more dedicated documents. Because books on both topics are
likely to appear soon, we'll merely scratch their surfaces
here. Moreover, this book says almost nothing about lower-level
networking layers such as TCP/IP. If you're curious about what
happens on the Internet at the bit-and-wire level, consult a good
networking text for more details.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-10-SECT-1.1.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.1.1.3 Running examples in this part of the book</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-10-337096"></A>Internet
scripts generally imply execution contexts that earlier examples in
this book have not. That is, it usually takes a bit more to run
programs that talk over networks. Here are a few pragmatic notes
about this part's examples up front:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">You don't need to download extra packages to run examples in
this part of the book. Except in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>, all of
the examples we'll see are based on the standard set of
Internet-related modules that come with Python (they are installed in
Python's library directory).
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">You don't need a state-of-the-art network link or an account on
a web server to run most of the examples in this and the following
chapters; a PC and dial-up Internet account will usually suffice.
We'll study configuration details along the way, but
client-side programs are fairly simple to run.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">You don't need an account on a web server machine to run the
server-side scripts in later chapters (they can be run by any web
browser connected to the Net), but you will need such an account to
change these scripts.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-10-337097"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-10-337098"></A>When a Python script opens an Internet
connection (with the <TT>socket</TT> or protocol modules),
Python will happily use whatever Internet link exists on your
machine, be that a dedicated T1 line, a DSL line, or a simple modem.
For instance, opening a socket on a Windows PC automatically
initiates processing to create a dial-up connection to your Internet
Service Provider if needed (on my laptop, a Windows modem connection
dialog automatically pops up). In other words, if you have a way to
connect to the Net, you likely can run programs in this chapter.
</P>

<P class="docText">Moreover, as long as your machine supports sockets, you probably can
run many of the examples here even if you have no Internet connection
at all. As we'll see, a machine name "localhost" or
"" usually means the local computer itself. This allows
you to test both the client and server sides of a dialog on the same
computer without connecting to the Net. For example, you can run both
socket-based clients and servers locally on a Windows PC without ever
going out to the Net.
</P>

<P class="docText">Some later examples assume that a particular kind of server is
running on a server machine (e.g., FTP, POP, SMTP), but client-side
scripts work on any Internet-aware machine with Python installed.
Server-side examples in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-12.html#python2-CHP-12">Chapter 12</A>, <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-13.html#python2-CHP-13">Chapter 13</A>, and <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-14.html#python2-CHP-14">Chapter 14</A> require more: you'll need a web server
account to code CGI scripts, and you must download advanced
third-party systems like JPython and Zope separately (or find them by
viewing <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>).

<P><A NAME="python2-CHP-10-SIDEBAR-1"></A><TABLE CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="90%" BORDER="1"><TR><TD>
<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">In the Beginning There Was Grail</H2>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-10-337099"></A>Besides
creating the Python language, Guido van Rossum also wrote a World
Wide Web browser in Python, named (appropriately enough) Grail. Grail
was partly developed as a demonstration of Python's
capabilities. It allows users to browse the Web much like Netscape or
Internet Explorer, but can also be programmed with Grail
applets -- Python/Tkinter programs downloaded from a server when
accessed and run on the client by the browser. Grail applets work
much like Java applets in more widespread browsers (more on applets
in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>).
</P>

<P class="docText">Grail is no longer under development and is mostly used for research
purposes today. But Python still reaps the benefits of the Grail
project, in the form of a rich set of Internet tools. To write a
full-featured web browser, you need to support a wide variety of
Internet protocols, and Guido packaged support for all of these as
standard library modules that are now shipped with the Python
language.
</P>

<P class="docText">Because of this legacy, Python now includes standard support for
Usenet news (NNTP), email processing (POP, SMTP, IMAP), file
transfers (FTP), web pages and interactions (HTTP, URLs, HTML, CGI),
and other commonly used protocols (Telnet, Gopher, etc.). Python
scripts can connect to all of these Internet components by simply
importing the associated library module.
</P>

<P class="docText">Since Grail, additional tools have been added to Python's
library for parsing XML files, OpenSSL secure sockets, and more. But
much of Python's Internet support can be traced back to the
Grail browser -- another example of Python's support for
code reuse at work. At this writing, you can still find the Grail at
