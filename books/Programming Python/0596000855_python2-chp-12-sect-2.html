<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1042"></A>
<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1043"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1044"></A>Simply put, CGI scripts implement much of
the interaction you typically experience on the Web. They are a
standard and widely used mechanism for programming web site
interaction. There are other ways to add interactive behavior to web
sites with Python, including client-side solutions (e.g., JPython
applets and Active Scripting), as well as server-side technologies,
which build upon the basic CGI model (e.g., Active Server Pages and
Zope), and we will discuss these briefly at the end of <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>, too. But by and large, CGI server-side
scripts are used to program much of the activity on the Web.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.2.1 The Script Behind the Curtain</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337466"></A>Formally speaking, CGI scripts are programs
that run on a server machine and adhere to the Common Gateway
Interface -- a model for browser/server communications, from which
CGI scripts take their name. Perhaps a more useful way to understand
CGI, though, is in terms of the interaction it implies.
</P>

<P class="docText">Most people take this interaction for granted when browsing the Web
and pressing buttons in web pages, but there is a lot going on behind
the scenes of every transaction on the Web. From the perspective of a
user, it's a fairly familiar and simple process:
</P>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1">
<LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Submission</span>. When you visit a web site to
purchase a product or submit information online, you generally fill
in a form in your web browser, press a button to submit your
information, and begin waiting for a reply.
</P></span></LI>
<LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Response</span>. Assuming all is well with both your
Internet connection and the computer you are contacting, you
eventually get a reply in the form of a new web page. It may be a
simple acknowledgement (e.g, "Thanks for your order") or
a new form that must be filled out and submitted again.
</P></span></LI>
</OL></span>
<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337467"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-12-337468"></A>And, believe it or
not, that simple model is what makes most of the Web hum. But
internally, it's a bit more complex. In fact, there is a subtle
client/server socket-based architecture at work -- your web
browser running on your computer is the <span class="docEmphasis">client</span>,
and the computer you contact over the Web is the
<span class="docEmphasis">server</span>. Let's examine the interaction
scenario again, with all the gory details that users usually never
see.
</P>

<A NAME="IXT-12-337470"></A> <A NAME="IXT-12-337471"></A> <A NAME="IXT-12-337472"></A>When you fill out a form page in a web
browser and press a submission button, behind the scenes your web
browser sends your information across the Internet to the server
machine specified as its receiver. The server machine is usually a
remote computer that lives somewhere else in both cyberspace and
reality. It is named in the URL you access (the Internet address
string that appears at the top of your browser). The target server
and file can be named in a URL you type explicitly, but more
typically they are specified in the HTML that defines the submission
page itself -- either in a hyperlink, or in the
"action" tag of a form's HTML. However the server
is specified, the browser running on your computer ultimately sends
your information to the server as bytes over a socket, using
techniques we saw in the last two chapters. On the server machine, a
program called an HTTP server runs perpetually, listening on a socket
for incoming data from browsers, usually on port number
80.<A NAME="IXT-12-337473"></A>
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Processing</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="IXT-12-337474"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-12-337475"></A>When
your information shows up at the server machine, the HTTP server
program notices it first and decides how to handle the request. If
the requested URL names a simple <span class="docEmphasis">web page</span> (e.g.,
a URL ending in <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF=".html">.html</A>), the HTTP
server opens the named HTML file on the server machine and sends its
text back to the browser over a socket. On the client, the browser
reads the HTML and uses it to construct the next page you see. But if
the URL requested by the browser names an <span class="docEmphasis">executable
program</span> instead (e.g., a URL ending in <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF=".cgi">.cgi</A>), the HTTP server starts the named
program on the server machine to process the request and redirects
the incoming browser data to the spawned program's
<TT>stdin</TT> input stream and environment variables. That
program is usually a CGI script -- a program run on the remote
server machine somewhere in cyberspace, not on your computer. The CGI
script is responsible for handling the request from this point on; it
may store your information in a database, charge your credit card,
and so on.

<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="IXT-12-337476"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-12-337477"></A>Ultimately, the CGI script prints HTML to
generate a new response page in your browser. When a CGI script is
started, the HTTP server takes care to connect the script's
<TT>stdout</TT> standard output stream to a socket that the
browser is listening to. Because of this, HTML code printed by the
CGI script is sent over the Internet, back to your browser, to
produce a new page. The HTML printed back by the CGI script works
just as if it had been stored and read in from an HTML file; it can
define a simple response page or a brand new form coded to collect
additional information.
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337478"></A> <A NAME="IXT-12-337479"></A>In other words,
CGI scripts are something like <span class="docEmphasis">callback handlers</span>
for requests generated by web browsers that require a program to be
run dynamically; they are automatically run on the server machine in
response to actions in a browser. Although CGI scripts ultimately
receive and send standard structured messages over sockets, CGI is
more like a higher-level procedural convention for sending and
receiving information between a browser and a server.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.2.2 Writing CGI Scripts in Python</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337480"></A> <A NAME="IXT-12-337481"></A>If all of the above sounds complicated,
relax -- Python, as well as the resident HTTP server, automates
most of the tricky bits. CGI scripts are written as fairly autonomous
programs, and they assume that startup tasks have already been
accomplished. The HTTP web server program, not the CGI script,
implements the server-side of the HTTP protocol itself. Moreover,
Python's library modules automatically dissect information sent
up from the browser and give it to the CGI script in an easily
digested form. The upshot is that CGI scripts may focus on
application details like processing input data and producing a result
page.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337482"></A>As mentioned earlier, in the context of
CGI scripts, the <TT>stdin</TT> and
<TT>stdout</TT> streams are automatically tied to sockets
connected to the browser. In addition, the HTTP server passes some
browser information to the CGI script in the form of shell
environment variables. To CGI programmers, that means:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Input</span> data sent from the browser to the server
shows up as a stream of bytes in the <TT>stdin</TT> input
stream, along with shell environment variables.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Output</span> is sent back from the server to the
client by simply printing properly formatted HTML to the
<TT>stdout</TT> output stream.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">The most complex parts of this scheme include parsing all the input
information sent up from the browser and formatting information in
the reply sent back. Happily, Python's standard library largely
automates both tasks:
</P>

<A NAME="IXT-12-337483"></A><A NAME="IXT-12-337484"></A><DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Input</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList"><A NAME="IXT-12-337483"></A>With the Python
<TT>cgi</TT> module, inputs typed into a web browser form
or appended to a URL string show up as values in a dictionary-like
object in Python CGI scripts. Python parses the data itself and gives
us an object with one <TT>key:value</TT> pair per input
sent by the browser that is fully independent of transmission style
(form or URL).
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Output</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The <TT>cgi</TT> module also has tools for automatically
escaping strings so that they are legal to use in HTML (e.g.,
replacing embedded <TT>&lt;</TT>, <TT>&gt;</TT>,
and <TT>&amp;</TT> characters with HTML escape codes).
Module <TT>urllib</TT> provides other tools for formatting
text inserted into generated URL strings (e.g., adding
<TT>%XX</TT> and <TT>+</TT>
escapes).<A NAME="IXT-12-337484"></A>
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">We'll study both of these interfaces in detail later in this
chapter. For now, keep in mind that although any language can be used
to write CGI scripts, Python's standard modules and language
attributes make it a snap.
</P>

<P class="docText">Less happily, CGI scripts are also intimately tied to the syntax of
HTML, since they must generate it to create a reply page. In fact, it
can be said that Python CGI scripts embed HTML, which is an entirely
distinct language in its own right. As we'll also see, the fact
that CGI scripts create a user interface by printing HTML syntax
means that we have to take special care with the text we insert into
a web page's code (e.g., escaping HTML operators). Worse, CGI
scripts require at least a cursory knowledge of HTML forms, since
that is where the inputs and target script's address are
typically specified. This book won't teach HTML in-depth; if
you find yourself puzzled by some of the arcane syntax of the HTML
generated by scripts here, you should glance at an HTML introduction,
such as O'Reilly's <span class="docEmphasis">HTML and XHTML: The
Definitive Guide.</span><A NAME="IXT-12-337485"></A> <A NAME="IXT-12-337486"></A>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337487"></A> <A NAME="IXT-12-337488"></A>Like GUIs,
web-based systems are highly interactive, and the best way to get a
feel for some of these examples is to test-drive them live. Before we
get into some code, it's worth noting that all you need to
<span class="docEmphasis">run</span> the examples in the next few chapters is a
web browser. That is, all the Web examples we will see here can be
run from any web browser on any machine, whether you've
installed Python on that machine or not. Simply type this URL at the
top:<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[1]</A></sup>
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[1]</A></sup> <A NAME="IXT-12-337489"></A>Given that
this edition may not be updated for many years, it's not
impossible that the server name in this address <span class="docEmphasis">starship.python.net</span> might change over time.
If this address fails, check the book updates at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://rmi.net/~lutz/about-pp.html">http://rmi.net/~lutz/about-pp.html</A> to see if
a new examples site address has been posted. The rest of the main
page's URL will likely be unchanged. Note, though, that some
examples hardcode the <I>starship</I> host server name
in URLs; these will be fixed on the new server if moved, but not on
your book CD. Run script <I>fixsitename.py</I> later in
this chapter to change site names automatically.</p></blockquote>

<PRE>http://starship.python.net/~lutz/PyInternetDemos.html</PRE>

<P class="docText">That address loads a launcher page with links to all the example
files installed on a server machine whose domain name is <span class="docEmphasis">starship.python.net</span> (a machine dedicated to
Python developers). The launcher page itself appears as shown in
<A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-12-FIG-1">Figure 12-1</A>, running under Internet Explorer. It
looks similar in other browsers. Each major example has a link on
this page, which runs when clicked.

<P class="docText">The launcher page, and all the HTML files in this chapter, can also
be loaded locally, from the book's example distribution
directory on your machine. They can even be opened directly off the
book's CD (view CD-ROM content online at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>)and may be opened by buttons on the top-level book
demo launchers. However, the CGI scripts ultimately invoked by some
of the example links must be run on a server, and thus require a live
Internet connection. If you browse root pages locally on your
machine, your browser will either display the scripts' source
code or tell you when you need to connect to the Web to run a CGI
script. On Windows, a connection dialog will likely pop up
automatically, if needed.

<A NAME="IXT-12-337491"></A> <A NAME="IXT-12-337492"></A>Of
course, running scripts in your browser isn't quite the same as
writing scripts on your own. If you do decide to change these CGI
programs or write new ones from scratch, you must be able to access
web server machines:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">To change server-side scripts, you need an account on a web server
machine with an installed version of Python. A basic account on such
a server is often enough. Then edit scripts on your machine and
upload to the server by FTP.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">To type explicit command lines on a server machine or edit scripts on
the server directly, you will need to also have shell access on the
web server. Such access lets you telnet to that machine to get a
command-line prompt.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Unlike the last chapter's examples, Python server-side scripts
require both Python and a server. That is, you'll need access
to a web server machine that supports CGI scripts in general and that
either already has an installed Python interpreter or lets you
install one of your own. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are
more supportive than others on this front, but there are many options
here, both commercial and free (more on this later).
</P>

<P class="docText">Once you've located a server to host your scripts, you may
modify and upload the CGI source code file from this book's CD
to your own server and site by FTP. If you do, you may also want to
run two Python command-line scripts on your server after uploading:
<I>fixcgi.py</I> and
<I>fixsitename.py</I>, both presented later in this
chapter. The former sets CGI script permissions, and the latter
replaces any <I>starship</I> server name references in
example links and forms with your own server's name.
We'll study additional installation details later in this
chapter, and explore a few custom server options at the end of <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>.

<H5 class="docSection3Title">12.2.3.2 Viewing server-side examples and output</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337493"></A>The source
code of examples in this part of the book is listed in the text and
included on the book's CD (see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>). In all cases, if you wish to view
the source code of an HTML file, or the HTML generated by a Python
CGI script, you can also simply select your browser's View
Source menu option while the corresponding web page is displayed.
</P>

<P class="docText">Keep in mind, though, that your browser's View Source option
lets you see the <span class="docEmphasis">output</span> of a server-side script
after it has run, but not the source code of the script itself. There
is no automatic way to view the Python source code of the CGI scripts
themselves, short of finding them in this book or its CD.
</P>

<P class="docText">To address this issue, later in this chapter we'll also write a
CGI-based program called <TT>getfile</TT>, which allows the
source code of any file on this book's web site (HTML, CGI
script, etc.) to be downloaded and viewed. Simply type the desired
file's name into a web page form referenced by the <span class="docEmphasis">getfile.html</span> link on the Internet demos
launcher page, or add it to the end of an explicitly typed URL as a
parameter like this:
</P>

<PRE>http://.../getfile.cgi?filename=somefile.cgi</PRE>

<P class="docText">In response, the server will ship back the text of the named file to
your browser. This process requires explicit interface steps, though,
and much more knowledge than we've gained thus far, so see
ahead for details.<A NAME="IXTR3-283"></A>
