<H3 class="docSection1Title">12.6 More on HTML and URL Escapes</H3>

<P class="docText">Perhaps the most subtle change in the last section's rewrite is
that, for robustness, this version also calls
<TT>cgi.escape</TT> for the language
<span class="docEmphasis">name</span>, not just for the language's code
snippet. It's unlikely but not impossible that someone could
pass the script a language name with an embedded HTML character. For
example, a URL
like:<A NAME="IXT-12-337580"></A>
</P>

<PRE>http://starship.python.net/~lutz/Basics/languages2reply.cgi?language=a&lt;b</PRE>

<P class="docText">embeds a <TT>&lt;</TT> in the language name parameter (the
name is <TT>a&lt;b</TT>). When submitted, this version uses
<TT>cgi.escape</TT> to properly translate the
<TT>&lt;</TT> for use in the reply HTML, according to the
standard HTML escape conventions discussed earlier:
</P>

<PRE>&lt;TITLE&gt;Languages&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Syntax&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;HR&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;a&amp;lt;b&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;
Sorry--I don't know that language
&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;HR&gt;</PRE>

<P class="docText">The original version doesn't escape the language name, such
that the embedded <TT>&lt;b</TT> is interpreted as an HTML
tag (which may make the rest of the page render in bold font!). As
you can probably tell by now, text escapes are pervasive in CGI
scripting -- even text that you may think is safe must generally
be escaped before being inserted into the HTML code in the reply
stream.

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337581"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-12-337582"></A>Notice, though, that while it's
wrong to embed an unescaped <TT>&lt;</TT> in the HTML code
reply, it's perfectly okay to include it literally in the
earlier URL string used to trigger the reply. In fact, HTML and URLs
define completely different characters as special. For instance,
although <TT>&amp;</TT> must be escaped as
<TT>&amp;amp</TT> inside HTML code, we have to use other
escaping schemes to code a literal <TT>&amp;</TT> within a
URL string (where it normally separates parameters). To pass a
language name like <TT>a&amp;b</TT> to our script, we have
to type the following URL:
</P>

<PRE>http://starship.python.net/~lutz/Basics/languages2reply.cgi?language=a%26b</PRE>

<P class="docText">Here, <TT>%26</TT> represents <TT>&amp;</TT>
 -- the <TT>&amp;</TT> is replaced with a
<TT>%</TT> followed by the hexadecimal value (0x26) of its
ASCII code value (38). By URL standard, most nonalphanumeric
characters are supposed to be translated to such escape sequences,
and spaces are replaced by <TT>+</TT> signs. Technically,
this convention is known as the
<I>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</I> query string
format, and it's part of the magic behind those bizarre URLs
you often see at the top of your browser as you surf the Web.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.6.2 Python HTML and URL Escape Tools</H4>

<P class="docText">If you're like me, you probably don't have the
hexadecimal value of the ASCII code for <TT>&amp;</TT>
committed to memory. Luckily, Python provides tools that
automatically implement URL escapes, just as
<TT>cgi.escape</TT> does for HTML escapes. The main thing
to keep in mind is that HTML code and URL strings are written with
entirely different syntax, and so they employ distinct escaping
conventions. Web users don't generally care, unless they need
to type complex URLs explicitly (browsers handle most escape code
details internally). But if you write scripts that must generate HTML
or URLs, you need to be careful to escape characters that are
reserved in either syntax.
</P>

<P class="docText">Because HTML and URLs have different syntaxes, Python provides two
distinct sets of tools for escaping their text. In the standard
Python library:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList"><TT>cgi.escape</TT> escapes text to be embedded in HTML.</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><TT>urllib.quote</TT> and <TT>quote_plus</TT>
escape text to be embedded in URLs.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">The <TT>urllib</TT> module also has tools for undoing URL
escapes (<TT>unquote</TT>,
<TT>unquote_plus</TT>), but HTML escapes are undone during
HTML parsing at large (<TT>htmllib</TT>). To illustrate the
two escape conventions and tools, let's apply each toolset to a
few simple examples.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-12-SECT-6.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.6.3 Escaping HTML Code</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337583"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-12-337584"></A>As we saw earlier,
<TT>cgi.escape</TT> translates code for inclusion within
HTML. We normally call this utility from a CGI script, but it's
just as easy to explore its behavior interactively:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>import cgi</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>cgi.escape('a &lt; b &gt; c &amp; d "spam"', 1)</B>
'a &amp;lt; b &amp;gt; c &amp;amp; d &amp;quot;spam&amp;quot;'

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>s = cgi.escape("1&lt;2 &lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;")</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>s</B>
'1&amp;lt;2 &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;hello&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;'</PRE>

<P class="docText">Python's <TT>cgi</TT> module automatically converts
characters that are special in HTML syntax according to the HTML
convention. It translates <TT>&lt;</TT>,
<TT>&gt;</TT>, <TT>&amp;</TT>, and with an extra
true argument, <TT>"</TT>, into escape sequences of the
form <TT>&amp;X;</TT>, where the <TT>X</TT> is a
mnemonic that denotes the original character. For instance,
<TT>&amp;lt;</TT> stands for the "less than"
operator (<TT>&lt;</TT>) and <TT>&amp;amp;</TT>
denotes a literal ampersand (<TT>&amp;</TT>).
</P>

<P class="docText">There is no <span class="docEmphasis">un</span>-escaping tool in the CGI module,
because HTML escape code sequences are recognized within the context
of an HTML parser, like the one used by your web browser when a page
is downloaded. Python comes with a full HTML parser, too, in the form
of standard module <TT>htmllib</TT>, which imports and
specializes tools in module <TT>sgmllib</TT> (HTML is a
kind of SGML syntax). We won't go into details on the HTML
parsing tools here (see the library manual for details), but to
illustrate how escape codes are eventually undone, here is the SGML
module at work reading back the last output above:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>from sgmllib import TestSGMLParser</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>p = TestSGMLParser(1)</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>s</B>
'1&amp;lt;2 &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;hello&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>for c in s:</B>
...    <B>p.feed(c)</B>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>p.close(  )</B>
data: '1&lt;2 &lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;'</PRE>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-12-SECT-6.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.6.4 Escaping URLs</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1256"></A>By
contrast, URLs reserve other characters as special and must adhere to
different escape conventions. Because of that, we use different
Python library tools to escape URLs for transmission. Python's
<TT>urllib</TT> module provides two tools that do the
translation work for us: <TT>quote</TT>, which implements
the standard <TT>%XX</TT> hexadecimal URL escape code
sequences for most nonalphanumeric characters, and
<TT>quote_plus</TT>, which additionally translates spaces
to <TT>+</TT> plus signs. The <TT>urllib</TT>
module also provides functions for unescaping quoted characters in a
URL string: <TT>unquote</TT> undoes <TT>%XX</TT>
escapes, and <TT>unquote_plus</TT> also changes plus signs
back to spaces. Here is the module at work, at the interactive
prompt:<A NAME="IXT-12-337585"></A> <A NAME="IXT-12-337586"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-12-337587"></A>
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>import urllib</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>urllib.quote("a &amp; b #! c")</B>
'a%20%26%20b%20%23%21%20c'

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>urllib.quote_plus("C:\stuff\spam.txt")</B>
'C%3a%5cstuff%5cspam.txt'

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>x = urllib.quote_plus("a &amp; b #! c")</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>x</B>
'a+%26+b+%23%21+c'

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>urllib.unquote_plus(x)</B>
'a &amp; b #! c'</PRE>

<P class="docText">URL escape sequences embed the hexadecimal values of non-safe
characters following a <TT>%</TT> sign (usually, their
ASCII codes). In <TT>urllib</TT>, non-safe characters are
usually taken to include everything except letters, digits, a handful
of safe special characters (any of <TT>_,.-)</TT>, and
<TT>/</TT> by default). You can also specify a string of
safe characters as an extra argument to the quote calls to customize
the translations; the argument defaults to <TT>/</TT>, but
passing an empty string forces <TT>/</TT> to be escaped:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>urllib.quote_plus("uploads/index.txt")</B>
'uploads/index.txt'

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>urllib.quote_plus("uploads/index.txt", '')</B>
'uploads%2findex.txt'</PRE>

<P class="docText">Note that Python's <TT>cgi</TT> module also
translates URL escape sequences back to their original characters and
changes <TT>+</TT> signs to spaces during the process of
extracting input information. Internally,
<TT>cgi.FieldStorage</TT> automatically calls
<TT>urllib.unquote</TT> if needed to parse and unescape
parameters passed at the end of URLs (most of the translation happens
in <TT>cgi.parse_qs</TT>). The upshot is that CGI scripts
get back the original, unescaped URL strings, and don't need to
unquote values on their own. As we've seen, CGI scripts
don't even need to know that inputs came from a URL at all.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-12-SECT-6.5"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">12.6.5 Escaping URLs Embedded in HTML Code</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-12-337588"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-12-337589"></A>But what do we do for URLs inside HTML?
That is, how do we escape when we generate and embed text inside a
URL, which is itself embedded inside generated HTML code? Some of our
earlier examples used hardcoded URLs with appended input parameters
inside <TT>&lt;A HREF&gt;</TT> hyperlink tags; file
<I>languages2.cgi</I>, for instance, prints HTML that
includes a URL:
</P>

<PRE>&lt;a href="getfile.cgi?filename=languages2.cgi"&gt;</PRE>

<P class="docText">Because the URL here is embedded in HTML, it must minimally be
escaped according to HTML conventions (e.g., any
<TT>&lt;</TT> characters must become
<TT>&amp;lt;</TT>), and any spaces should be translated to
<TT>+</TT> signs. A <TT>cgi.escape(url)</TT>
call, followed by a <TT>string.replace(url,</TT>
<TT>"</TT> <TT>",</TT> <TT>"+")</TT>
would take us this far, and would probably suffice for most cases.
</P>

<P class="docText">That approach is not quite enough in general, though, because HTML
escaping conventions are not the same as URL conventions. To robustly
escape URLs embedded in HTML code, you should instead call
<TT>urllib.quote_plus</TT> on the URL string before adding
it to the HTML text. The escaped result also satisfies HTML escape
conventions, because <TT>urllib</TT> translates more
characters than <TT>cgi.escape</TT>, and the
<TT>%</TT> in URL escapes is not special to HTML.
</P>

<P class="docText">But there is one more wrinkle here: you also have to be careful with
<TT>&amp;</TT> characters in URL strings that are embedded
in HTML code (e.g., within <TT>&lt;A&gt;</TT> hyperlink
tags). Even if parts of the URL string are URL-escaped, when more
than one parameter is separated by a <TT>&amp;</TT>, the
<TT>&amp;</TT> separator might also have to be escaped as
<TT>&amp;amp;</TT> according to HTML conventions. To see
why, consider the following HTML hyperlink
tag:<A NAME="IXT-12-337590"></A>
</P>

<PRE>&lt;A HREF="file.cgi?name=a&amp;job=b&amp;amp=c&amp;sect=d&amp;lt=e"&gt;hello&lt;/a&gt;</PRE>

<P class="docText">When rendered in most browsers I've tested, this URL link winds
up looking incorrectly like this (the "S" character is
really a non-ASCII section marker):
</P>

<PRE>file.cgi?name=a&amp;job=b&amp;=c&amp;S=d&lt;=e</PRE>

<P class="docText">The first two parameters are retained as expected
(<TT>name=a</TT>, <TT>job=b</TT>), because
<TT>name</TT> is not preceded with an
<TT>&amp;</TT>, and <TT>&amp;job</TT> is not
recognized as a valid HTML character escape code. However, the
<TT>&amp;amp</TT>, <TT>&amp;sect</TT>, and
<TT>&amp;lt</TT> parts are interpreted as special
characters, because they do name valid HTML escape codes. To make
this work as expected, the <TT>&amp;</TT> separators should
be escaped:
</P>

<PRE>&lt;A HREF="file.cgi?name=a&amp;amp;job=b&amp;amp;amp=c&amp;amp;sect=d&amp;amp;lt=e"&gt;hello&lt;/a&gt;</PRE>

<P class="docText">Browsers render this fully escaped link as expected:</P>

<PRE>file.cgi?name=a&amp;job=b&amp;amp=c&amp;sect=d&amp;lt=e</PRE>

<P class="docText">The moral of this story is that unless you can be sure that the names
of all but the leftmost URL query parameters embedded in HTML are not
the same as the name of any HTML character escape code like
<TT>amp</TT>, you should generally run the entire URL
through <TT>cgi.escape</TT> after escaping its parameter
names and values with <TT>urllib.quote_plus</TT>:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>import cgi</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>cgi.escape('file.cgi?name=a&amp;job=b&amp;amp=c&amp;sect=d&amp;lt=e')</B>
'file.cgi?name=a&amp;amp;job=b&amp;amp;amp=c&amp;amp;sect=d&amp;amp;lt=e'</PRE>

<P class="docText">Having said that, I should add that some examples in this book do not
escape <TT>&amp;</TT> URL separators embedded within HTML
simply because their URL parameter names are known to not conflict
with HTML escapes. This is not, however, the most general solution;
when in doubt, escape much and often.<A NAME="IXTR3-328"></A>

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"</H2>

<P class="docText">Lest these formatting rules sound too clumsy (and send you screaming
into the night!), note that the HTML and URL escaping conventions are
imposed by the Internet itself, not by Python. (As we've seen,
Python has a different mechanism for escaping special characters in
string constants with backslashes.) These rules stem from the fact
that the Web is based upon the notion of shipping formatted strings
around the planet, and they were surely influenced by the tendency of
different interest groups to develop very different notations.
</P>

<P class="docText">You can take heart, though, in the fact that you often don't
need to think in such cryptic terms; when you do, Python automates
the translation process with library tools. Just keep in mind that
any script that generates HTML or URLs dynamically probably needs to
call Python's escaping tools to be robust. We'll see both
the HTML and URL escape tool sets employed frequently in later
examples in this chapter and the next two. In <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>, we'll also meet systems such as Zope
that aim to get rid of some of the low-level complexities that CGI
scripters face. And as usual in programming, there is no substitute
for brains; amazing technologies like the Internet come at a cost in
complexity.
