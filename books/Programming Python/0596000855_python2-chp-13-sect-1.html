<P class="docText">This chapter is the fourth part of our look at Python Internet
programming, and continues the last chapter's discussion. In
the prior chapter, we explored the fundamentals of server-side CGI
scripting in Python. Armed with that knowledge, in this and the
following chapter we move on to two larger case studies that
underscore advanced CGI topics:<A NAME="IXT-13-337602"></A>

<P class="docList">This chapter presents <span class="docEmphasis">PyMailCgi</span>,a web site for reading and sending email that illustrates
security concepts, hidden form fields, URL generation, and more.
Because this system is similar in spirit to the PyMailGui program
shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-11.html#python2-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A>, this example also serves as a
comparison of web and non-web applications.

<P class="docList"><A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-14.html#python2-CHP-14">Chapter 14</A>, presents <span class="docEmphasis">PyErrata,</span>
a web site for posting book comments and bugs that
introduces database concepts in the CGI domain. This system
demonstrates common ways to store data persistently on the server
between web transactions, and addresses concurrent update problems
inherent in the CGI model.
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">Both of these case studies are based on CGI scripting, but implement
full-blown web sites that do something more useful than the last
chapter's examples.
</P>

<P class="docText">As usual, these chapters split their focus between application-level
details and Python programming concepts. Because both of the case
studies presented are fairly large, they illustrate system design
concepts that are important in actual projects. They also say more
about CGI scripts in general. PyMailCgi, for example, introduces the
notions of state retention in hidden fields and URLs, as well as
security concerns and encryption. PyErrata provides a vehicle for
exploring persistent database concepts in the context of web sites.
</P>

<P class="docText">Neither system here is particularly flashy or feature-rich as web
sites go (in fact, the initial cut of PyMailCgi was thrown together
during a layover at a Chicago airport). Alas, you will find neither
dancing bears nor blinking lights at either of these sites. On the
other hand, they were written to serve real purposes, speak more to
us about CGI scripting, and hint at just how far Python server-side
programs can take us. In <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>, we will
explore higher-level systems and tools that build upon ideas we will
apply here. For now, let's have some fun with Python on the
Web.
