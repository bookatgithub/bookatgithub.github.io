<H3 class="docSection1Title">14.2 The PyErrata Web Site</H3>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1437"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1438"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1439"></A><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1440"></A>
<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1441"></A>The last chapter concluded with a
discussion of the downsides of deploying applications on the Web. But
now that I've told you all the reasons you might
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> want to design systems for the Web,
I'm going to completely contradict myself and present a system
that cries out for a web-based implementation. This chapter presents
the PyErrata web site, a Python program that lets arbitrary people on
arbitrary machines submit book comments and bug reports (usually
called <span class="docEmphasis">errata</span>) over the Web, using just a web
browser.
</P>

<P class="docText">PyErrata is in some ways simpler than the PyMailCgi case study
presented in the previous chapter. From a user's perspective,
PyErrata is more hierarchical than linear: user interactions are
shorter and spawn fewer pages. There is also little state retention
in web pages themselves in PyErrata; URL parameters pass state in
only one isolated case, and no hidden form fields are generated.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-14-337683"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-14-337684"></A>On
the other hand, PyErrata introduces an entirely new dimension:
<span class="docEmphasis">persistent data storage</span>. State (error and
comment reports) is stored permanently by this system on the server,
either in flat pickle files or a shelve-based database. Both raise
the specter of concurrent updates, since any number of users out in
cyberspace may be accessing the site at the same time.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-14-SECT-2.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">14.2.1 System Goals</H4>

<P class="docText">Before you ponder too long over the seeming paradox of a book that
comes with its own bug-reporting system, I should provide a little
background. Over the last five years, I've been fortunate
enough to have had the opportunity to write four books, a large
chapter in a reference book, and various magazine articles and
training materials. Changes in the Python world have also provided
opportunities to rewrite books from the ground up. It's been
both wildly rewarding and lucrative work (well, rewarding, at least).
</P>

<P class="docText">But one of the first big lessons one learns upon initiation in the
publishing business is that typos are a fact of life. Really. No
matter how much of a perfectionist you are, books will have bugs.
Furthermore, big books tend to have more bugs than little books, and
in the technical publishing domain, readers are often sufficiently
savvy and motivated to send authors email when they find those bugs.
</P>

<P class="docText">That's a terrific thing, and helps authors weed out typos in
reprints. I always encourage and appreciate email from readers. But I
get lots of email -- at times, so much so that given my schedule,
I find it difficult to even reply to every message, let alone
investigate and act on every typo report. I get lots of other email
too, and can miss a reader's typo report if I'm not
careful.
</P>

<P class="docText">About a year ago, I realized that I just couldn't keep up with
all the traffic and started thinking about alternatives. One obvious
way to cut down on the overhead of managing reports is to delegate
responsibility -- to offload at least some report-processing tasks
to the people who generate the reports. That is, I needed to somehow
provide a widely available system, separate from my email account,
that automates report posting and logs reports to be reviewed as time
allows.
</P>

<P class="docText">Of course, that's exactly the sort of need that the Internet is
geared to. By implementing an error-reporting system as a web site,
any reader can visit and log reports from any machine with a browser,
whether they have Python installed or not. Moreover, those reports
can be logged in a database at the web site for later inspection by
both author and readers, instead of requiring manual extraction from
incoming email.
</P>

<P class="docText">The implementation of these ideas is the PyErrata system -- a web
site implemented with server-side Python programs. PyErrata allows
readers to post bug reports and comments about this edition of
<span class="docEmphasis">Programming Python</span>, as well as view the
collection of all prior posts by various sort keys. Its goal is to
replace the traditional errata list pages I've had to maintain
manually for other books in the past.
</P>

<P class="docText">More than any other web-based example in this book, PyErrata
demonstrates just how much work can be saved with a little Internet
scripting. To support the first edition of this book, I hand-edited
an HTML file that listed all known bugs. With PyErrata, server-side
programs generate such pages dynamically from a user-populated
database. Because list pages are produced on demand, PyErrata not
only publishes and automates list creation, it also provides multiple
ways to view report data. I wouldn't even try to reorder the
first edition's static HTML file list.
</P>

<P class="docText">PyErrata is something of an experiment in open systems, and as such
is vulnerable to abuse. I still have to manually investigate reports,
as time allows. But it at least has the potential to ease one of the
chores that generally goes unmentioned in typical publishing
contracts.
</P>

<A NAME="IXT-14-337686"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-14-337687"></A>Like
other web-based systems in this part of the book, PyErrata consists
of a collection of HTML files, Python utility modules, and
Python-coded CGI scripts that run on a shared server instead of on a
client. Unlike those other web systems, PyErrata also implements a
persistent database and defines additional directory structures to
support it. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-14-FIG-1">Figure 14-1</A> shows the top-level contents
of the site, seen on Windows from a PyEdit Open dialog.

CD-ROM content online at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>). To
install this site on the Net, all the files and directories you see
here are uploaded to the server machine and stored in a
<I>PyErrata</I> subdirectory within the root of the
directory that is exposed to the Web (my <I>public_html
</I>directory). The top-level files of this site implement
browse and submit operations as well as database interfaces. A few
resource page files and images show up in this listing too, but are
ignored in this book. Besides files, this site has subdirectories of
its own:<A NAME="IXT-14-337688"></A>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-14-SECT-2.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">14.2.3 Presentation Strategy</H4>

<P class="docText">PyErrata takes logic factoring, code reuse, and encapsulation to
extremes. Top-level scripts, for example, are often just a few lines
long and ultimately invoke generic logic in common utility modules.
With such an architecture, mixing short code segments with lots of
screen shots makes it tough to trace the flow of control through the
program.
</P>

<P class="docText">To make this system easier to study, we're going to take a
slightly different approach here. PyErrata's implementation
will be presented in three main sections corresponding to major
functional areas of the system: report browsing, report submission,
and database interfaces. The site root page will be shown before
these three sections, but mostly just for context; it's simple,
static HTML.
</P>

<P class="docText">Within the browsing and submission sections, all user interaction
models (and screen shots) are shown first, followed by all the source
code used to implement that interaction. Like the PyForm example in
<A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-16.html#python2-CHP-16">Chapter 16</A>, PyErrata is at heart a database-access
program, and its database interfaces are ultimately the core of the
system. Because these interfaces encapsulate most low-level storage
details, though, we'll save their presentation for last.
</P>

<P class="docText">Although you still may have to jump around some to locate modules
across functional boundaries, this organization of all the code for
major chunks of the system in their own sections should help minimize
page-flipping.
</P>

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">Use the Source, Luke</H2>

<P class="docText">I want to insert the standard case-study caveat here: although this
chapter does explain major concepts along the way, understanding the
whole story is left partly up to you. As always, please consult the
source code listings in this chapter (and at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>) for details not
spelled out explicitly. I've taken this minimal approach
deliberately, mostly because I assume you already know a lot about
CGI scripting and the Python language by this point in the book, but
also because real-world development time is spent as much on reading
other people's code as on writing your own. Python makes both
tasks relatively easy, but now is your chance to see how for
yourself.
</P>

<P class="docText">I also wish to confess right off that this chapter has a hidden
agenda. PyErrata not only shows more server-side scripting
techniques, but also illustrates common Python development concepts
at large. Along the way, we focus on this system's current
software architecture and point out a variety of design alternatives.
Be sure to pay special attention to the way that logic has been
layered into multiple abstraction levels. For example, by separating
database and user-interface (page generation) code, we minimize code
redundancy and cross-module dependencies and maximize code reuse.
Such techniques are useful in all Python systems, web-based or not.
