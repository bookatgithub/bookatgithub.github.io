<H3 class="docSection1Title">14.8 Designing for Reuse and Growth</H3>

<P class="docText">I admit it: PyErrata may be thrifty, but it's also a bit
self-centered. The database interfaces presented in the prior
sections work as planned and serve to separate all database
processing from CGI scripting details. But as shown in this book,
these interfaces aren't as generally reusable as they could be;
moreover, they are not yet designed to scale up to larger database
applications.
</P>

<P class="docText">Let's wrap up this chapter by donning our software code review
hats for just a few moments and exploring some design alternatives
for PyErrata. In this section, I highlight the PyErrata database
interface's obstacles to general applicability, not as
self-deprecation, but to show how programming decisions can impact
reusability.
</P>

<P class="docText">Something else is going on in this section too. There is more concept
than code here, and the code that is here is more like an
experimental design than a final product. On the other hand, because
that design is coded in Python, it can be run to test the feasibility
of design alternatives; as we've seen, Python can be used as a
form of <span class="docEmphasis">executable pseudocode</span>.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-14-SECT-8.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">14.8.1 Reusability</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-14-337741"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-14-337742"></A>As
we saw, code reuse is pervasive within PyErrata: top-level calls
filter down to common browse and submit modules, which in turn call
database classes that reuse a common module. But what about sharing
PyErrata code with other systems? Although not designed with
generality in mind, PyErrata's database interface modules could
<span class="docEmphasis">almost</span> be reused to implement other kinds of
file- and shelve-based databases outside the context of PyErrata
itself. However, we need a few more tweaks to turn these interfaces
into widely useful tools.
</P>

<P class="docText">As is, shelve and file-directory names are hardcoded into the
storage-specific subclass modules, but another system could import
and reuse their <TT>Dbase</TT> classes and provide
different directory names. Less generally, though, the
<TT>dbcommon</TT> module adds two attributes to all new
records (submit-time and report-state) that may or may not be
relevant outside PyErrata. It also assumes that stored values are
mappings (dictionaries), but that is less PyErrata-specific.
</P>

<P class="docText">If we were to rewrite these classes for more general use, it would
make sense to first repackage the four <TT>DbaseErrata</TT>
and <TT>DbaseComment</TT> classes in modules of their own
(they are very specific instances of file and shelve databases). We
would probably also want to somehow relocate
<TT>dbcommon</TT>'s insertion of submit-time and
report-state attributes from the <TT>dbcommon</TT> module
to these four classes themselves (these attributes are specific to
PyErrata databases). For instance, we might define a new
<TT>DbasePyErrata</TT> class that sets these attributes and
is a mixed-in superclass to the four PyErrata storage-specific
database classes:
</P>

<PRE># in new module
class DbasePyErrata:
     def storeItem(self, newdata):
        secsSinceEpoch          = time.time(  )
        timeTuple               = time.localtime(secsSinceEpoch)
        y_m_d_h_m_s             = timeTuple[:6]      
        newdata['Submit date']  = '%s/%02d/%02d, %02d:%02d:%02d' % y_m_d_h_m_s
        newdata['Report state'] = 'Not yet verified'
        self.writeItem(newdata)

# in dbshelve
class Dbase(MutexCntl, dbcommon.Dbase):
    # as is

# in dbfiles
class Dbase(dbcommon.Dbase):
    # as is

# in new file module
class DbaseErrata(DbasePyErrata,  dbfiles.Dbase):
    dirname = 'DbaseFiles/errataDB/'
class DbaseComment(DbasePyErrata, dbfiles.Dbase):
    dirname = 'DbaseFiles/commentDB/'

# in new shelve module
class DbaseErrata(DbasePyErrata,  dbshelve.Dbase):
    filename = 'DbaseShelve/errataDB'
class DbaseComment(DbasePyErrata, dbshelve.Dbase):
    filename = 'DbaseShelve/commentDB'</PRE>

<P class="docText">There are more ways to structure this than we have space to cover
here. The point is that by factoring out application-specific code,
<TT>dbshelve</TT> and <TT>dbfiles</TT> modules
not only serve to keep PyErrata interface and database code distinct,
but also become generally useful data-storage tools.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-14-SECT-8.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">14.8.2 Scalability</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1572"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1573"></A>PyErrata's
database interfaces were designed for this specific
application's storage requirements alone and don't
directly support very large databases. If you study the database code
carefully, you'll notice that submit operations update a single
item, but browse requests load entire report databases all at once
into memory. This scheme works fine for the database sizes expected
in PyErrata, but performs badly for larger data sets. We could extend
the database classes to handle larger data sets too, but they would
likely require new top-level interfaces altogether.
</P>

<P class="docText">Before I stopped updating it, the static HTML file used to list
errata from the first edition of this book held just some 60 reports,
and I expect a similarly small data set for other books and editions.
With such small databases, it's reasonable to load an entire
database into memory (i.e., into Python lists and dictionaries) all
at once, and frequently. Indeed, the time needed to transfer a web
page containing 60 records across the Internet likely outweighs the
time it takes to load 60 report files or shelve keys on the server.
</P>

<P class="docText">On the other hand, the database may become too slow if many more
reports than expected are posted. There isn't much we could do
to optimize the "Simple list" and "With
index" display options, since they really do display all
records. But for the "Index only" option, we might be
able to change our classes to load only records having a selected
value in the designated report field.
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, we could work around database load bottlenecks by
changing our classes to implement <span class="docEmphasis">delayed
loading</span> of records: rather than returning the real
database, load requests could return objects that look the same but
fetch actual records only when needed. Such an approach might require
no changes in the rest of the system's code, but may be complex
to implement.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-14-SECT-8.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">14.8.2.1 Multiple shelve field indexing</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1574"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1575"></A>Perhaps a better approach would be to
define an entirely new top-level interface for the "Index
only" option -- one that really does load only records
matching a field value query. For instance, rather than storing all
records in a single shelve, we could implement the database as a
<span class="docEmphasis">set of index shelves</span>, one per record field, to
associate records by field values. Index shelve
<span class="docEmphasis">keys</span> would be values of the associated field;
shelve <span class="docEmphasis">values</span> would be lists of records having
that field value. The shelve entry lists might contain either
redundant copies of records, or unique names of flat files holding
the pickled record dictionaries, external to the index shelves (as in
the current flat-file model).
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-14-337743"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-14-337744"></A>For
example, the PyErrata comment database could be structured as a
<span class="docEmphasis">directory of flat files</span> to hold pickled report
dictionaries, together with five shelves to index the values in all
record fields (submitter-name, submitter-email, submit-mode,
submit-date, report-state). In the report-state shelve, there would
be one entry for each possible report state (verified, rejected,
etc.); each entry would contain a list of records with just that
report-state value. Field value queries would be fast, but store and
load operations would become more complex:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">To store a record in such a scheme, we would first pickle it to a
uniquely named flat file, then insert that file's name into
lists in all five shelves, using each field's value as shelve
key.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">To load just the records matching a field/value combination, we would
first index that field's shelve on the value to fetch a
filename list, and step through that list to load matching records
only, from flat pickle files.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Let's take the leap from hypothetical to concrete, and
prototype these ideas in Python. If you're following closely,
you'll notice that what we're really talking about here
is an <span class="docEmphasis">extension</span> to the flat-file database
structure, one that merely adds index shelves. Hence, one possible
way to implement the model is as a subclass of the current flat-file
classes. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-14-EX-31">Example 14-31</A> does just that, as proof of the
design concept.

<P class="docText">Regardless of whether you use locking or not, the
<TT>dbaseindexed</TT> flat-files plus multiple-shelve
indexing scheme can speed access by keys for large databases.
However, it would also require changes to the top-level CGI script
logic that implements "Index only" displays, and so is
not without seams. It may also perform poorly for very large
databases, as record information would span multiple files. If
pressed, we could finally extend the database classes to talk to a
real database system such as Oracle, MySQL, PostGres, or Gadfly
(described in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-16.html#python2-CHP-16">Chapter 16</A>).
</P>

<P class="docText">All of these options are not without trade-offs, but we have now come
dangerously close to stepping beyond the scope of this chapter.
Because the PyErrata database modules were designed with neither
general applicability nor broad scalability in mind, additional
mutations are left as suggested exercises.<A NAME="IXTR3-411"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-412"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-413"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-414"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-415"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-416"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-417"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-418"></A>
