<P class="docText">This chapter concludes our look at Python Internet programming by
exploring a handful of Internet-related topics and packages.
We've covered many Internet topics in the previous five
chapters -- socket basics, client and server-side scripting tools,
and programming full-blown web sites with Python. Yet we still
haven't seen many of Python's standard built-in Internet
modules in action. Moreover, there is a rich collection of
third-party extensions for scripting the Web with Python that we have
not touched on at all.
</P>

<P class="docText">In this chapter, we explore a grab-bag of additional Internet-related
tools and third-party extensions of interest to Python Internet
developers. Along the way, we meet larger Internet packages, such as
HTMLgen, JPython, Zope, PSP, Active Scripting, and Grail. We'll
also study standard Python tools useful to Internet programmers,
including Python's restricted execution mode, XML support, COM
interfaces, and techniques for implementing proprietary servers. In
addition to their practical uses, these systems demonstrate just how
much can be achieved by wedding a powerful object-oriented scripting
language such as Python to the Web.
</P>

<P class="docText">Before we start, a disclaimer: none of these topics is presented in
much detail here, and undoubtedly some interesting Internet systems
will not be covered at all. Moreover, the Internet evolves at
lightning speed, and new tools and techniques are certain to emerge
after this edition is published; indeed, most of the systems in this
chapter appeared in the five years <span class="docEmphasis">after</span> the
first edition of this book was written, and the next five years
promise to be just as prolific. As always, the standard moving-target
caveat applies: read the Python library manual's Internet
section for details we've skipped, and stay in touch with the
Python community at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A> for information about
extensions not covered due to a lack of space or a lack of
clairvoyance.
