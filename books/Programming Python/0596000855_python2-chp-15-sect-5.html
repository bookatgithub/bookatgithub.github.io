<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1717"></A>I briefly mentioned the Grail browser
near the start of <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-10.html#python2-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>. Many of
Python's Internet tools date back to and reuse the work that
went into Grail, a full-blown Internet web browser
that:<A NAME="IXT-15-337851"></A>

<P class="docText">As mentioned earlier, Grail was something of a proof-of-concept for
using Python to code large-scale Internet applications. It implements
all the usual Internet protocols and works much like common browsers
such as Netscape and Internet Explorer. Grail pages are implemented
with the Tk text widgets that we met in the GUI part of this
book.<A NAME="IXT-15-337854"></A>
</P>

<P class="docText">More interestingly, the Grail browser allows applets to be written in
Python. Grail applets are simply bits of Python code that live on a
server but are run on a client. If an HTML document references a
Python class and file that live on a server machine, Grail
automatically downloads the Python code over a socket and runs it on
the client machine, passing it information about the browser's
user interface. The downloaded Python code may use the passed-in
browser context information to customize the user interface, add new
kinds of widgets to it, and perform arbitrary client-side processing
on the local machine. Roughly speaking, Python applets in Grail serve
the same purposes as Java applets in common Internet browsers: they
perform client-side tasks that are too complex or slow to implement
with other technologies such as server-side CGI scripts and generated
HTML.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.5.1 A Simple Grail Applet Example</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1722"></A>Writing
Grail applets is remarkably straightforward. In fact, applets are
really just Python/Tkinter programs; with a few exceptions, they
don't need to "know" about Grail at all.
Let's look at a short example; the code in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-15-EX-6">Example 15-6</A> simply adds a button to the browser, which
changes its appearance each time it's pressed (its bitmap is
reconfigured in the button callback handler).
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-15-337855"></A>There
are two components to this page definition: an HTML file and the
Python applet code it references. As usual, the
<I>grail.html</I> HTML file that follows describes how
to format the web page when the HTML's URL address is selected
in a browser. But here, the <TT>APP</TT> tag also specifies
a Python applet (class) to be run by the browser. By default, the
Python module is assumed to have the same name as the class and must
be stored in the same location (URL directory) as the HTML file that
references it. Additional <TT>APP</TT> tag options can
override the applet's default location.
</P>

&lt;TITLE&gt;Grail Applet Test Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Test an Applet Here!&lt;/H1&gt;
Click this button!
<B>&lt;APP CLASS=Question&gt;</B>
&lt;/BODY&gt;</PRE>


<P class="docText">The applet file referenced by the HTML is a Python script that adds
widgets to the Tkinter-based Grail browser. Applets are simply
classes in Python modules. When the <TT>APP</TT> tag is
encountered in the HTML, the Grail browser downloads the
<I>Question.py </I>source code module (<A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-15-EX-7">Example 15-7</A>) and makes an instance of its
<TT>Question</TT> class, passing in the browser widget as
the master (parent). The master is the hook that lets applets attach
new widgets to the browser itself; applets extend the GUI constructed
by the HTML in this way.
</P>


<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="python2-CHP-15-EX-7"></A>Example 15-7. PP2E\Internet\Other\Question.py </H5>
<PRE># Python applet file: Question.py

class Question:                          # run by grail?
    def __init__(self, parent):          # parent=browser
        self.button = Button(parent, 
                             bitmap='question',
                             command=self.action)
        self.button.pack(  )

    def action(self):
        if self.button['bitmap'] == 'question':
            self.button.config(bitmap='questhead')
        else:
            self.button.config(bitmap='question')

if __name__ == '__main__':

    button = Question(root)        # parent=Tk: top-level
    root.mainloop(  )</PRE>


<P class="docText">Notice that nothing in this class is Grail- or Internet-specific; in
fact, it can be run (and tested) standalone as a Python/Tkinter
program. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-15-FIG-3">Figure 15-3</A> is what it looks like if run
standalone on Windows (with a <TT>Tk</TT> application root
object as the master); when run by Grail (with the browser/page
object as the master), the button appears as part of the web page
instead. Either way, its bitmap changes on each press.

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-15-337856"></A>In effect, Grail applets are simply Python
modules that are linked into HTML pages by using the
<TT>APP</TT> tag. The Grail browser downloads the source
code identified by an <TT>APP</TT> tag and runs it locally
on the client during the process of creating the new page. New
widgets added to the page (like the button here) may run Python
callbacks on the client later, when activated by the user.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-15-337857"></A>Applets
interact with the user by creating one or more arbitrary Tk widgets.
Of course, the previous example is artificial; but notice that the
button's callback handler could do anything we can program in
Python: updating persistent information, popping up new user
interaction dialogs, calling C extensions, etc. However, by working
in concert with Python's restricted execution mode (discussed
later) applets can be prevented from performing potentially unsafe
operations, like opening local files and talking over sockets.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-15-FIG-4">Figure 15-4</A> shows a screen shot of Grail in action,
hinting at what's possible with Python code downloaded to and
run on a client. It shows the animated "game of life"
demo; everything you see here is implemented using Python and the
Tkinter GUI interface. To run the demo, you need to install Python
with the Tk extension and download the Grail browser to run locally
on your machine or copy it off the CD. Then point your browser to a
URL where any Grail demo lives.

<P class="docText">Having said all that, I should add that Grail is no longer formally
maintained, and is now used primarily for research purposes (Guido
never intended for Grail to put Netscape or Microsoft out of
business). You can still get it for free (find it at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A>) and use it for
surfing the Web or experimenting with alternative web browser
concepts, but it is not the active project it was a few years ago.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-15-337858"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-15-337859"></A>If you want to code web browser applets
in Python, the more common approach today is to use the JPython
system described previously to compile your scripts into Java applet
bytecode files, and use Java libraries for your scripts'
user-interface portions. Embedding Python code in HTML with the
Active Scripting extension described later in this chapter is yet
another way to integrate client-side code.<A NAME="IXTR3-428"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-429"></A>

<td valign="top">
<P class="docText">Alas, this advice may change over time too. For instance, if Tkinter
is ever ported to JPython, you will be able to build GUIs in applet
files with Tkinter, rather than with Java class libraries. In fact,
as I wrote this, an early release of a complete Java JNI
implementation of the Python built-in <TT>_tkinter</TT>
module (which allows JPython scripts to import and use the Tkinter
module in the standard Python library) was available on the Net at
<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://jtkinter.sourceforge.net/default.htm">http://jtkinter.sourceforge.net</A>.
Whether this makes Tkinter a viable GUI option under JPython or not,
all current approaches are subject to change. Grail, for instance,
was a much more prominent tool when the first edition of this book
was written. As ever, be sure to keep in touch with developments in
the Python community at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A>; clairvoyance
isn't all it's cracked up to be.
