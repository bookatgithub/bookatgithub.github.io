<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1900"></A>Pickling
allows you to store arbitrary objects on files and file-like objects,
but it's still a fairly unstructured medium; it doesn't
directly support easy access to members of collections of pickled
objects. Higher-level structures can be added, but they are not
inherent:<A NAME="IXT-16-337984"></A>
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">You can sometimes craft your own higher-level pickle file
organizations with the underlying filesystem (e.g., you can store
each pickled object in a file whose name uniquely identifies the
object), but such an organization is not part of pickling itself and
must be manually managed.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">You can also store arbitrarily large dictionaries in a pickled file
and index them by key after they are loaded back into memory; but
this will load the entire dictionary all at once when unpickled, not
just the entry you are interested in.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Shelves provide some structure to collections of pickled objects.
They are a type of file that stores arbitrary Python objects by key
for later retrieval, and they are a standard part of the Python
system. Really, they are not much of a new topic -- shelves are
simply a combination of DBM files and object pickling:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">To store an in-memory object by key, the <TT>shelve</TT>
module first serializes the object to a string with the
<TT>pickle</TT> module, and then it stores that string in a
DBM file by key with the <TT>anydbm</TT>
module.<A NAME="IXT-16-337985"></A> <A NAME="IXT-16-337986"></A>

back to the original in-memory object with the
<TT>pickle</TT> module.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Because <TT>shelve</TT> uses <TT>pickle</TT>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.5.1 Using Shelves</H4>

<P class="docText">In other words, <TT>shelve</TT> is just a go-between; it
serializes and deserializes objects so that they can be placed in DBM
files. The net effect is that shelves let you store nearly arbitrary
Python objects on a file by key, and fetch them back later with the
same key. Your scripts never see all this interfacing, though. Like
DBM files, shelves provide an interface that looks like a dictionary
that must be opened. To gain access to a shelve, import the module
and open your file:
</P>

<PRE>import shelve
dbase = shelve.open("mydbase")</PRE>

<P class="docText">Internally, Python opens a DBM file with name
<I>mydbase</I>, or creates it if it does not yet exist.
Assigning to a shelve key stores an
object:<A NAME="IXT-16-337989"></A> <A NAME="IXT-16-337990"></A>
</P>

<PRE>dbase['key'] = object</PRE>

<P class="docText">Internally, this assignment converts the object to a serialized
byte-stream and stores it by key on a DBM file. Indexing a shelve
fetches a stored object:
</P>

<PRE>value = dbase['key']</PRE>

<P class="docText">Internally, this index operation loads a string by key from a DBM
file and unpickles it into an in-memory object that is the same as
the object originally stored. Most dictionary operations are
supported here, too:
</P>

<PRE>len(dbase)      # number of items stored
dbase.keys(  )    # stored item key index</PRE>

<P class="docText">And except for a few fine points, that's really all there is to
using a shelve. Shelves are processed with normal Python dictionary
syntax, so there is no new database API to learn. Moreover, objects
stored and fetched from shelves are normal Python objects; they do
not need to be instances of special classes or types to be stored
away. That is, Python's persistence system is external to the
persistent objects themselves. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-16-TABLE-2">Table 16-2</A>

operations.<A NAME="IXT-16-337991"></A>

<DD>
<P class="docList">When Python pickles a class instance to store it in a shelve, it

<P class="docText">The key point in this is that the class itself is not stored with its
instances, but is instead reimported later when instances are
fetched. The upshot is that by modifying external classes in module
files, we can change the way stored objects' data is

objects. It's as if the class is a program that processes
stored records.

shelve adds a set of additional rules you need to be aware of.
Really, these are imposed by the <TT>pickle</TT> module,
not <TT>shelve</TT>, so be sure to follow these if you
store class objects with <TT>pickle</TT> directly, too.

<DD>
<P class="docList">The Python pickler stores instance attributes only when pickling an
instance object, and reimports the class later to recreate the
instance. Because of that, the classes of stored objects must be
importable when objects are unpickled -- they must be coded
unnested at the top level of a module file visible on PYTHONPATH.
Further, they must be associated with a real module when instances
are pickled, not a top-level script (with module name
<TT>__main__</TT> ), and you need to be careful about
moving class modules after instances are stored. When an instance is
unpickled, Python must find its class's module on PYTHONPATH
using the original module name (including any package path prefixes),
and fetch the class from that module using the original class name.
If the module or class has been moved or renamed, it might not be
found.

</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Class changes must be backwards-compatible</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Although Python lets you change a class while instances of it are
stored on a shelve, those changes must be backwards-compatible with
the objects already stored. For instance, you cannot change the class
to expect an attribute not associated with already-stored persistent
instances unless you first manually update those stored instances or
provide extra conversion protocols on the class.
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">In a prior Python release, persistent object classes also had to
either use constructors with no arguments, or they had to provide
defaults for all constructor arguments (much like the notion of a C++
copy constructor). This constraint was dropped as of Python
1.5.2 -- classes with non-defaulted constructor arguments now work
fine in the pickling system.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[2]</A></sup>
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[2]</A></sup> Subtle thing:
internally, Python now avoids calling the class to recreate a pickled
instance and instead simply makes a class object generically, inserts
instance attributes, and sets the instance's
<TT>__class__</TT> pointer to the original class directly.
This avoids the need for defaults, but it also means that the class
<TT>__init__</TT> constructors are no longer called as
objects are unpickled, unless you provide extra methods to force the
call. See the library manual for more details, and see the
<TT>pickle</TT> module's source code
(<I>pickle.py</I> in the source library) if
you're curious about how this works. Better yet, see the
<TT>formtable</TT> module listed ahead in this
chapter -- it does something very similar with
<TT>__class__</TT> links to build an instance object from a
class and dictionary of attributes, without calling the class's
<TT>__init__</TT> constructor. This makes constructor
argument defaults unnecessary in classes used for records browsed by
PyForm, but it's the same idea.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-16-338005"></A> <A NAME="IXT-16-338006"></A>In addition to the above constraints, keep
in mind that files created by an underlying DBM system are not
necessarily compatible with all possible DBM implementations. For
instance, a file generated by <TT>gdbm</TT> may not be
readable by a Python with another DBM module installed, unless you
explicitly import <TT>gdbm</TT> instead of
<TT>anydbm</TT> (assuming it's installed at all). If
DBM file portability is a concern, make sure that all the Pythons
that will read your data use compatible DBM modules.

shelves store objects persistently, they are not really
object-oriented database systems (OODBs). Such systems also implement
features like object decomposition and delayed ("lazy")
component fetches, based on generated object IDs: parts of larger
objects are loaded into memory only as they are accessed. It's
possible to extend shelves to support such features, but you
don't need to -- the Zope system described in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>, includes an implementation of a more complete
OODB system. It is constructed on top of Python's built-in
persistence support, but offers additional features for advanced data
stores. See the previous chapter for information and links.<A NAME="IXTR3-450"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-451"></A>
