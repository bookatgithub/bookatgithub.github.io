<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1931"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-1932"></A>Shelves are a powerful tool; they
allow scripts to throw Python objects on a keyed-access file and load
them back later in a single step. They aren't quite a
full-blown database system, though; objects (records) are accessed
with a single key, and there is no notion of SQL queries. It's
as if shelves were a database with a single index and no other
query-processing support.
</P>

<P class="docText">Although it's possible to build a multiple-index interface to
store data with multiple shelves, it's not a trivial task and
requires manually coded extensions (see the
<TT>dbaseindexed</TT> module in the PyErrata system near
the end of <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-14.html#python2-CHP-14">Chapter 14</A> for a prototype of this
concept).

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-16-338010"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-16-338011"></A>For industrial-strength persistence needs,
Python also supports relational database systems. Today, there are
freely available interfaces that let Python scripts utilize all
common database systems, both free and commercial: Oracle, Sybase,
Informix, mSql, MySql, Interbase, Postgres, ODBC, and more. In
addition, the Python community has defined a database API
specification that works portably with a variety of underlying
database packages. Scripts written for this API can be migrated to
different database vendor packages with minimal or no source code
changes.<A NAME="IXT-16-338012"></A>
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-16-SECT-6.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.6.1 Interface Overview</H4>

<P class="docText">Unlike all the persistence topics presented in this chapter and book
so far, though, SQL databases are optional extensions that are not
part of Python itself, and you need to know SQL to make the most
sense of their interfaces. Because I don't have space to teach
SQL in this text, this section instead gives a brief overview of the
API; please consult other SQL references and the database API
resources mentioned in the next section for more details.
</P>

<P class="docText">The good news is that you can access SQL databases from Python,
through a straightforward and portable model. The Python database API
specification defines an interface for communicating with underlying
database systems from Python scripts. Vendor-specific database
interfaces for Python may or may not conform to this API completely,
but all database extensions for Python seem minor variations on a
theme. SQL databases in Python are grounded on a few concepts:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Connection objects</span> represent a connection to a
database, are the interface to rollback and commit operations, and
generate cursor objects.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Cursor objects</span> represent a single SQL statement
submitted as a string, and can be used to step through SQL statement
results.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Query results</span> of SQL <TT>select</TT>
statements are returned to scripts as Python lists of Python tuples,
representing database tables of rows. Within these row tuples, field
values are normal Python objects such as strings, integers, and
floats, or special types (e.g., <TT>[('bob',38),</TT>
<TT>('emily',37)]</TT>).
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Beyond this, the API defines a standard set of database exception
types, special database type object constructors (e.g., nulls and
dates), and informational calls.
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, to establish a database connection under the Python
API-compliant Oracle interface available from Digital Creations,
install the extension and then run a line of this form:
</P>

<PRE>connobj = Connect("user/password@system")</PRE>

<P class="docText">The string argument's contents may vary per database and
vendor, but they generally contain what you provide to log in to your
database system. Once you have a connection object, there a variety
of things you can do with it, including:
</P>

<PRE>connobj.close(  )             <I>close connection now (not at object __del__ time)</I>
connobj.commit(  )            <I>commit any pending transactions to the database</I>
connobj.rollback(  )          <I>roll database back to start of pending transactions</I>
connobj.getSource(<TT><I>proc</I></TT>)     <I>fetch stored procedure's code</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">But one of the most useful things to do with a connection object is
to generate a cursor object:<A NAME="IXT-16-338013"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-16-338014"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-16-338015"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-16-338016"></A>
</P>

<PRE>cursobj = connobj.cursor(  )      <I>return a new cursor object for running SQL</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">Cursor objects have a set of methods, too (e.g.,
<TT>close</TT> to close the cursor before its destructor
runs), but the most important may be this
one:<A NAME="IXT-16-338017"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-16-338018"></A>
</P>

<PRE>cursobj.execute(<TT><I>sqlstring</I></TT> [, <TT><I>parm</I></TT>, <TT><I>parm</I></TT>,...])   <I>run SQL query or command string</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">The <TT>execute</TT> method can be used to run a variety of
SQL statement strings:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">DDL</span> definition statements (e.g., CREATE TABLE)</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">DML</span> modification statements (e.g., UPDATE or
INSERT)
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">DQL</span> query statements (e.g., SELECT)</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">For DML statements, <TT>execute</TT> returns the number of
rows effected. For DQL query statements, a <TT>None</TT> is
returned and you must call one of the <TT>fetch</TT>
methods to complete the operation:
</P>

<PRE>tuple       = cursobj.fetchone(  )          <I>fetch next row of a query result</I></PRE>

<PRE>listoftuple = cursobj.fetchmany([<TT><I>size</I></TT>])   <I>fetch next set of rows of query result</I></PRE>

<PRE>listoftuple = cursobj.fetchall(  )          <I>fetch all remaining rows of the result</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">And once you've received fetch method results, table
information is processed using normal Python list and tuple object
operations (e.g., you can step through the tuples in a
<TT>fetchall</TT> result list with a simple
<TT>for</TT> loop). Most Python database interfaces also
allow you to provide values to be passed to SQL statement strings, by
providing targets and a tuple of parameters. For instance:
</P>

<PRE>query = 'SELECT name, shoesize FROM spam WHERE job = ? AND age = ?'  
cursobj.execute(query, (value1, value2))
results = cursobj.fetchall(  )
for row in results: <TT><I>...</I></TT></PRE>

<P class="docText">In this event, the database interface utilizes prepared statements
(an optimization and convenience) and correctly passes the parameters
to the database regardless of their Python types. The notation used
to code targets in the query string may vary in some database
interfaces (e.g., ":p1" and ":p2", rather
than "?" and "?"); in any event, this is not
the same as Python's "%" string formatting
operator.
</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, if your database supports stored procedures, you can
generally call them with the <TT>callproc</TT> method, or
by passing an SQL CALL or EXEC statement string to the
<TT>execute</TT> method; use a <TT>fetch</TT>
variant to retrieve its results.
</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.6.2 Resources</H4>

<P class="docText">There is more to database interfaces than the basics just mentioned,
but additional API documentation is readily available on the Web.
Perhaps the best resource for information about database extensions
today is the home page of the Python database special interest group
(SIG). Go to <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A>, click on the SIGs link
near the top, and navigate to the database group's page (or go
straight to <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/sigs/db-sig">http://www.python.org/sigs/db-sig</A>, the
page's current address at the time of writing). There,
you'll find API documentation, links to database
vendor-specific extension modules, and more.
</P>

<P class="docText">While you're at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://python.org/default.htm">python.org</A>,
be sure to also explore the Gadfly database package -- a
Python-specific SQL-based database extension, which sports wide
portability, socket connections for client/server modes, and more.
Gadfly loads data into memory, so it is currently somewhat limited in
scope. On the other hand, it is ideal for prototyping database
applications -- you can postpone cutting a check to a vendor until
it's time to scale up for deployment. Moreover, Gadfly is
suitable by itself for a variety of applications -- not every
system needs large data stores, but many can benefit from the power
of SQL.<A NAME="IXTR3-452"></A>
