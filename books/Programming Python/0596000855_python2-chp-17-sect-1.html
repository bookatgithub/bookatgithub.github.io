<P class="docText">Data structures are a central theme in most programs, whether you
know it or not. It may not always be obvious, because Python provides
a set of built-in types that make it easy to deal with structured
data: lists, strings, tuples, dictionaries, and the like. For simple
systems, these types are usually enough. Technically, dictionaries
make many of the classical searching algorithms unnecessary in
Python, and lists replace much of the work you'd do to support
collections in lower-level languages. Both are so easy to use,
though, that you generally never give them a second thought.
</P>

<P class="docText">But for advanced applications, we may need to add more sophisticated
types of our own to handle extra requirements. In this chapter,
we'll explore a handful of advanced data structure
implementations in Python: sets, stacks, graphs, and so on. As
we'll see, data structures take the form of new object types in
Python, integrated into the language's type model. That is,
objects we code in Python become full-fledged datatypes -- they
can look and feel just like built-in lists, numbers, and
dictionaries, to the scripts that use
them.<A NAME="IXT-17-338022"></A>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-17-338024"></A>Although the examples in this chapter
illustrate advanced programming techniques, they also underscore
Python's support for writing reusable software. By coding
object implementations with classes, modules, and other Python tools,
they naturally become generally useful components, which may be used
in any program that imports them. In effect, we will be building
libraries of data structure classes, whether we plan for it or not.
</P>

<P class="docText">In addition, although the examples in this chapter are pure Python
code, we will also be building a path towards the next part of the
book here. From the most general perspective, new Python objects can
be implemented in either Python or an integrated language such as C.
In particular, pay attention to the stack objects implemented in the
first section of this chapter; they will later be reimplemented in C
to gauge both the benefits and complexity of C migration.
