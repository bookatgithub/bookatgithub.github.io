<A NAME="IXT-18-338098"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-18-338099"></A>Let's look at a couple of
practical applications of string splits and joins. In many domains,
scanning files by columns is a fairly common task. For instance,
suppose you have a file containing columns of numbers output by
another system, and you need to sum each column's numbers. In
Python, string splitting does the job (see <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-18-EX-1">Example 18-1</A>). As an added bonus, it's easy to make
the solution a reusable tool in Python.
</P>


<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="python2-CHP-18-EX-1"></A>Example 18-1. PP2E\Lang\summer.py </H5>

<P class="docText">As usual, you can both <span class="docEmphasis">import</span> this module and

from the command line. The summer calls <TT>split</TT> to
make a list of strings representing the line's columns, and
<TT>eval</TT> to convert column strings to numbers.
Here's an input file that uses both blanks and tabs to separate
columns:

demonstrates one way that splitting and joining strings can be used
to parse sentences in a simple language. It is taken from a
rule-based expert system shell (holmes) that is written in Python and
included at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A> (see the top-level

<P class="docText">Tests and conclusions are conjunctions of terms (","
means "and"). Each term is a list of words or variables
separated by spaces; variables start with <TT>?</TT>. To
use a rule, it is translated to an internal form -- a dictionary
with nested lists. To display a rule, it is translated back to the
string form. For instance, given a call:
</P>

<PRE>rules.internal_rule('rule x if a ?x, b then c, d ?x')</PRE>

<P class="docText">the conversion in function <TT>internal_rule</TT> proceeds
as follows:

i = ['rule x', 'a ?x, b then c, d ?x']
t = ['a ?x, b', 'c, d ?x']
r = ['', 'x'] 
result = {'rule':'x', 'if':[['a','?x'], ['b']], 'then':[['c'], ['d','?x']]}</PRE>

<P class="docText">It first splits around the <TT>if</TT>, then around the
<TT>then</TT>, and finally around <TT>rule</TT>.
The result is the three substrings that were separated by the
keywords. Test and conclusion substrings are split around
"," and spaces last. <TT>join</TT> is used to
convert back (unparse) to the original string for display. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-18-EX-2">Example 18-2</A> is the concrete implementation of this scheme.

enough, at least for prototyping systems. You can always add a more
robust rule parser later or reimplement rules as embedded Python code

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-18-338102"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-18-338103"></A>As a rule of thumb, use the
<TT>string</TT> module's functions instead of things
like regular expressions whenever you can. They tend to be much
faster, because they've been moved to a C language
implementation. When you import <TT>string</TT>, it
internally replaces most of its content with functions imported from
the <TT>strop</TT> C extension module;
<TT>strop</TT> methods are reportedly 100-1000 times faster
than their Python-coded equivalents. <sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[a]</A></sup>
</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>string</TT> module was originally written in Python
but demands for string efficiency prompted recoding it in C. The
result was dramatically faster performance for
<TT>string</TT> client programs without impacting the
interface. That is, string module clients became instantly faster
without having to be modified for the new C-based module. A similar
migration was applied to the <TT>pickle</TT> module we met
in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-16.html#python2-CHP-16">Chapter 16</A>  -- the newer
<TT>cPickle</TT> recoding is compatible but much faster.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-18-338104"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-18-338105"></A>Which is a great lesson about Python
development: modules can be coded quickly in Python at first, and
translated to C later for efficiency if required. Because the
interface to Python and C extension modules is identical (both are
imported), C translations of modules are backward compatible with
their Python prototypes. The only impact of the translation of such
modules on clients is an improvement in performance.
</P>

<P class="docText">There is usually no need to move every module to C for delivery of an
application: you can pick and choose performance-critical modules
(like <TT>string</TT> and <TT>pickle</TT>) for
translation, and leave others coded in Python. Use the timing and
profiling techniques of the prior chapter to isolate which modules
will give the most improvement when translated to C. C-based
extension modules are introduced in the next part of this book.

<P class="docText">
Actually, in Python 2.0, the <TT>string</TT> module has changed its implementation again: it is now a frontend to new string <span class="docEmphasis">methods</span>, which are able to also handle Unicode strings.

<H5 class="docSection3Title">18.3.2.1 More on the holmes expert system shell</H5>

<P class="docText">So how are these rules actually used? As mentioned, the rule parser
we just met is part of the Python-coded holmes expert system shell.
This book does not cover holmes in detail due to lack of space; see
the <I>PP2E\AI\ExpertSystem</I> directory on the book
CD (see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>) for its code and documentation. But by way of introduction, holmes
is an inference engine that performs forward and backward chaining
deduction on rules that you supply. For example, a rule:
</P>

<PRE>rule pylike if ?X likes coding, ?X likes spam then ?X likes Python</PRE>

<P class="docText">can be used both to prove whether someone likes Python (backward,
from "then" to "if"), and to deduce that
someone likes Python from a set of known facts (forward, from
"if" to "then"). Deductions may span multiple
rules, and rules that name the same conclusion represent
alternatives. Holmes also performs simple pattern-matching along the
way to assign the variables that appear in rules (e.g.,
<TT>?X</TT>), and is able to explain its work.
</P>

<P class="docText">To make this all more concrete, let's step through a simple
holmes session. The <TT>+=</TT> interactive command adds a
new rule to the rule base by running the rule parser, and
<TT>@@</TT> prints the current rule base:
</P>

<PRE>C:..\PP2E\Ai\ExpertSystem\holmes\holmes&gt;<B>python holmes.py</B>
-Holmes inference engine-
holmes&gt; <B>+= rule pylike if ?X likes coding, ?X likes spam then ?X likes Python</B>
holmes&gt; <B>@@</B>
rule pylike if ?X likes coding, ?X likes spam then ?X likes Python.</PRE>

<P class="docText">Now, to kick off a backward-chaining proof of a goal, use the
<TT>?-</TT> command. A proof explanation is shown here;
holmes can also tell you why it is asking a question. Holmes pattern
variables can show up in both rules and queries; in rules, variables
provide generalization; in a query, they provide an answer:
</P>

<PRE>holmes&gt; <B>?- mel likes Python</B>
is this true: "mel likes coding" ? <B>y</B>
is this true: "mel likes spam" ? <B>y</B>
yes: (no variables)

show proof ? <B>yes</B>
  "mel likes Python" by rule pylike
      "mel likes coding" by your answer
      "mel likes spam" by your answer
more solutions? <B>n</B>

holmes&gt; <B>?- linda likes ?X</B>
is this true: "linda likes coding" ? <B>y</B>
is this true: "linda likes spam" ? <B>y</B>
yes: linda likes Python</PRE>

<P class="docText">Forward-chaining from a set of facts to conclusions is started with a
<TT>+-</TT> command. Here, the same rule is being applied
but in a different way:
</P>

<PRE>holmes&gt; <B>+- chris likes spam, chris likes coding</B>
I deduced these facts...
    chris likes Python
I started with these facts...
    chris likes spam
    chris likes coding
time: 0.0</PRE>

<P class="docText">More interestingly, deductions chain through multiple rules when part
of a rule's "if" is mentioned in another
rule's "then":
</P>

<PRE>holmes&gt; <B>+= rule 1 if thinks ?x then human ?x</B>
holmes&gt; <B>+= rule 2 if human ?x then mortal ?x</B>
holmes&gt; <B>?- mortal bob</B>
is this true: "thinks bob" ? <B>y</B>
yes: (no variables)

holmes&gt; <B>+- thinks bob</B>
I deduced these facts...
    human bob
    mortal bob
I started with these facts...
    thinks bob
time: 0.0</PRE>

<P class="docText">Finally, the <TT>@=</TT> command is used to load files of
rules that implement more sophisticated knowledgebases; the rule
parser is run on each rule in the file. Here is a file that encodes
animal classification rules; other example files are available on the
CD (see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>) if you'd like to experiment:
</P>

<PRE>holmes&gt; <B>@= ..&#184;bases\zoo.kb</B>
holmes&gt; <B>?- it is a penguin</B>
is this true: "has feathers" ? <B>why</B>
to prove "it is a penguin" by rule 17
this was part of your original query.
is this true: "has feathers" ? <B>y</B>
is this true: "able to fly" ? <B>n</B>
is this true: "black color" ? <B>y</B>
yes: (no variables)</PRE>

<P class="docText">Type "stop" to end a session and "help" for a
full commands list, and see the text files in the holmes directories
for more details. Holmes is an old system written before Python 1.0
(and around 1993), but still works unchanged on all platforms under
Python 1.5.2.<A NAME="IXTR3-495"></A>
