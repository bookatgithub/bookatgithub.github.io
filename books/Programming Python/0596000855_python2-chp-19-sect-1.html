<P class="docText">So far in this book, we've been using Python as it comes out of
the box. We have used interfaces to services outside Python, and
coded extensions as Python modules. But we haven't added any
external services beyond the built-in set. For many users, this makes
perfect sense: such standalone programming is one of the main ways
people apply Python. As we've seen, Python comes with batteries
included  -- interfaces to system tools, Internet protocols, GUIs,
filesystems, and much
more.<A NAME="IXT-19-338140"></A><A NAME="IXT-19-338141"></A><A NAME="IXT-19-338142"></A>
</P>

<P class="docText">But for many systems, Python's ability to integrate with
C-compatible components is a crucial feature of the language. In
fact, Python's role as an extension and interface language in
larger systems is one of the reasons for its popularity and why it is
often called a "scripting" language. Its design supports
<span class="docEmphasis">hybrid</span> systems that mix components written in a
variety of programming languages. Because different languages have
different strengths, being able to pick and choose on a
component-by-component basis is a powerful concept. You can add
Python to the mix anywhere you need an easy-to-use and flexible
language tool.<A NAME="IXT-19-338143"></A>
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, compiled languages such as C and C++ are optimized for
speed of <span class="docEmphasis">execution</span>, but are complex to
program -- for developers, but especially for end users. Because
Python is optimized for speed of <span class="docEmphasis">development</span>,
using Python scripts to control or customize software components
written in C or C++ can yield more flexible systems and dramatically
faster development modes. Systems designed to delegate customizations
to Python scripts don't need to be shipped with full source
code and don't require end users to learn complex or
proprietary languages. Moreover, moving selected components of a pure
Python program to C can optimize program
performance.<A NAME="IXT-19-338144"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">19.1.1 Integration Topics</H4>

<P class="docText">The last two technical chapters of this book introduce Python's
tools for interfacing to the outside world, and discuss both its
ability to be used as an embedded language tool in other systems and
its interfaces for extending Python scripts with new modules and
types implemented in C-compatible languages. I'll also
summarize other integration techniques that are less C-specific, such
as COM and JPython.
</P>

<P class="docText">When you mix Python with C components, either Python or C can be
"on top." Because of that, there are two distinct
integration APIs:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">extending</span> interface for running C extensions
from Python programs
<A NAME="IXT-19-338147"></A>
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">embedding</span> interface for running Python code
from C programs <A NAME="IXT-19-338148"></A>
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">This chapter covers extending, and the next explores embedding. Some
systems use only one scheme, but many use both. For instance,
embedded Python code run from C can also use linked-in C extensions
to interface with the enclosing application. And in callback-based
systems, C code accessed through extending interfaces may later use
embedding techniques to run Python callback handlers. Python has an
open and reentrant architecture that lets you mix languages
arbitrarily.
</P>

<P class="docText">Before we get into details, I should mention that Python/C
integration is a big topic -- in principle, the entire set of
<span class="docEmphasis">extern</span> C functions in the Python system makes up
its runtime interface. The next two chapters concentrate only on the
tools commonly used to implement integration with external modules.
For additional examples beyond this book and its CD (view CD-ROM
content online at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>), see the Python
source code itself; its <TT>Modules</TT> and
<TT>Objects</TT> directories are a wealth of code
resources. Most of the Python built-ins we have used in this
book -- from simple things such as integers and strings to more
advanced tools such as files, system calls, Tkinter, and DBM -- 
utilize integration APIs and can be studied in Python's source
code distribution.
</P>

<P class="docText">These chapters assume that you know basic C programming concepts. If
you don't, you won't miss much by skipping or skimming
these chapters. Typically, C developers code the extending and
embedding interfaces of a system, and others do the bulk of the
system's programming with Python alone. But if you know enough
about C programming to recognize a need for an extension language,
you probably already have the required background knowledge for this
chapter. The good news in both chapters is that much of the
complexity inherent in integrating Python with a static compiled
language like C can be automated with tools such as SWIG in the
extension domain, and higher-level APIs in the embedding world.
