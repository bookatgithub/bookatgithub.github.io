<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-2201"></A>
<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-2202"></A>Because
Python itself is coded in C today, compiled Python extensions can be
coded in any language that is C-compatible in terms of call stacks
and linking. That includes C, but also C++ with appropriate
"extern C" declarations (which are automatically provided
in Python header files). Python extensions coded in a C-compatible
language can take two forms:

<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">C modules</span>, which look and feel to their clients
like Python module files
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">C types</span>, which behave like standard built-in
types (numbers, lists, etc.)
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-19-338149"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-19-338150"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-19-338151"></A>Generally, C modules are used to
implement flat function libraries, and C types are used to code
objects that generate multiple instances. Because built-in types are
really just precoded C extension types, your C extension types can do
anything that built-in types can: method calls, addition, indexing,
slicing, and so on.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[1]</A></sup> In the current Python release, though, types are not
quite classes -- you cannot customize types by coding a Python
subclass unless you add "wrapper" classes as frontend
interfaces to the type. More on this later.
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[1]</A></sup> Yes, every time you make an
integer or string in Python, you generate a new C type instance
object (whether you know it or not). This isn't as inefficient
as you may think, though; as we'll see, type operations are
dispatched through fast C pointers, and Python internally caches some
integers and strings to avoid object creation when possible.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Both C modules and types register their operations with the Python
interpreter as C function pointers. In all cases, the C layer is
responsible for converting arguments passed from Python to C form,
and converting results from C to Python form. Python scripts simply
import C extensions and use them as though they were really coded in
Python; C code does all the translation work.
</P>

<P class="docText">C modules and types are also responsible for communicating errors
back to Python, detecting errors raised by Python API calls, and
managing garbage-collector reference counters on objects retained by
the C layer indefinitely -- Python objects held by your C code
won't be garbage-collected as long as you make sure their
reference counts don't fall to zero. C modules and types may
either be linked to Python statically (at build time) or dynamically
(when first imported).
