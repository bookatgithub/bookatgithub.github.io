<H3 class="docSection1Title">2.3 System Scripting Overview</H3>

<P class="docText">The next two sections will take a quick tour through
<TT>sys</TT> and <TT>os</TT>, before this chapter
moves on to larger system programming concepts. As I'm not
going to demonstrate every item in every built-in module, the first
thing I want to do is show you how to get more details on your own.
Officially, this task also serves as an excuse for introducing a few
core system scripting concepts -- along the way, we'll code
a first script to format documentation.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-3.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.3.1 Python System Modules</H4>

<P class="docText">Most system-level interfaces in Python are shipped in just two
modules: <TT>sys</TT> and <TT>os</TT>.
That's somewhat oversimplified; other standard modules belong
to this domain too (e.g., <TT>glob</TT>,
<TT>socket</TT>, <TT>thread</TT>,
<TT>time</TT>, <TT>fcntl</TT>), and some built-in
functions are really system interfaces as well (e.g.,
<TT>open</TT>). But <TT>sys</TT> and
<TT>os</TT> together form the core of Python's system
tools arsenal.
</P>

<P class="docText">In principle at least, <TT>sys</TT> exports components
related to the Python <span class="docEmphasis">interpreter</span> itself (e.g.,
the module search path), and <TT>os</TT> contains variables
and functions that map to the operating system on which Python is
run. In practice, this distinction may not always seem clear-cut
(e.g., the standard input and output streams show up in
<TT>sys</TT>, but they are at least arguably tied to
operating system paradigms). The good news is that you'll soon
use the tools in these modules so often that their locations will be
permanently stamped on your memory.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[1]</A></sup>
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[1]</A></sup> They may also
work their way into your subconscious. Python newcomers sometimes
appear on Internet discussion forums to express joy after
"dreaming in Python" for the first time. All possible
Freudian interpretations aside, it's not bad as dream motifs
go; after all, there are worse languages to dream in.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">The <TT>os</TT> module also attempts to provide a
<span class="docEmphasis">portable</span> programming interface to the underlying
operating system -- its functions may be implemented differently
on different platforms, but they look the same everywhere to Python
scripts. In addition, the <TT>os</TT> module exports a
nested submodule, <TT>os.path</TT>, that provides a
portable interface to file and directory processing tools.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-3.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.3.2 Module Documentation Sources</H4>

<P class="docText">As you can probably deduce from the preceding paragraphs, learning to
write system scripts in Python is mostly a matter of learning about
Python's system modules. Luckily, there are a variety of
information sources to make this task easier -- from module
attributes to published references and books.
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, if you want to know everything that a built-in module
exports, you can either read its library manual entry, study its
source code (Python is open source software, after all), or fetch its
attribute list and documentation string interactively. Let's
import <TT>sys</TT> and see what it's got:
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\System&gt; <B>python</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>import sys</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>dir(sys)</B>
['__doc__', '__name__', '__stderr__', '__stdin__', '__stdout__', 'argv',
'builtin_module_names', 'copyright', 'dllhandle', 'exc_info', 'exc_type',
'exec_prefix', 'executable', 'exit', 'getrefcount', 'hexversion', 'maxint',
'modules', 'path', 'platform', 'prefix', 'ps1', 'ps2', 'setcheckinterval',
'setprofile', 'settrace', 'stderr', 'stdin', 'stdout', 'version', 'winver']</PRE>

<P class="docText">The <TT>dir</TT> function simply returns a list containing
the string names of all the attributes in any object with attributes;
it's a handy memory-jogger for modules at the interactive
prompt. For example, we know there is something called
<TT>sys.version</TT>, because the name
<TT>version</TT> came back in the <TT>dir</TT>
result. If that's not enough, we can always consult the
<TT>__doc__</TT> string of built-in modules:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>sys.__doc__ </B>
...
<I> ...lots of text deleted here...</I>
...
count for an object (plus one :-)\012setcheckinterval(  ) -- control how often 
the interpreter checks for events\012setprofile(  ) -- set the global profiling
function\012settrace(  ) -- set the global debug tracing function\012"</PRE>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-3.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.3.3 Paging Documentation Strings</H4>

<P class="docText">The <TT>__doc__</TT> built-in attribute usually contains
a string of documentation, but may look a bit weird when
printed -- it's one long string with embedded line-feed
characters that print as <TT>\012</TT>, not a nice list of
lines. To format these strings for more humane display, I usually use
a utility script like the one in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-2-EX-1">Example 2-1</A>.
</P>


<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="python2-CHP-2-EX-1"></A>Example 2-1. PP2E\System\more.py </H5>
<PRE>#########################################################
# split and interactively page a string or file of text;
#########################################################

import string

def more(text, numlines=15):
    lines = string.split(text, '\n')
    while lines:
        chunk = lines[:numlines]
        lines = lines[numlines:]
        for line in chunk: print line
        if lines and raw_input('More?') not in ['y', 'Y']: break

    more(open(sys.argv[1]).read(  ), 10)     # page contents of file on cmdline</PRE>


<P class="docText">The meat of this file is its <TT>more</TT> function, and if
you know any Python at all, it should be fairly
straightforward -- it simply splits up a string around end-of-line
characters, and then slices off and displays a few lines at a time
(15 by default) to avoid scrolling off the screen. A slice expression
<TT>lines[:15]</TT> gets the first 15 items in a list, and
<TT>lines[15:]</TT> gets the rest; to show a different
number of lines each time, pass a number to the
<TT>numlines</TT> argument (e.g., the last line in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-2-EX-1">Example 2-1</A> passes 10 to the <TT>numlines</TT>
argument of the <TT>more</TT> function).
</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>string.split</TT> built-in call this script employs
returns a list of sub-strings (e.g., <TT>["line",
"line",...]</TT>). As we'll see later in this chapter, the
end-of-line character is always <TT>\n</TT> (which is
<TT>\012</TT> in octal escape form) within a Python script,
no matter what platform it is run upon. (If you don't already
know why this matters, DOS <TT>\r</TT> characters are
dropped when read.)
</P>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-3.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.3.4 Introducing the string Module</H4>

<P class="docText">Now, this is a simple Python program, but it already brings up three
important topics that merit quick detours here: it uses the
<TT>string</TT> module, reads from a file, and is set up to
be run or imported. The Python <TT>string</TT> module
isn't a system-related tool per se, but it sees action in most
Python programs. In fact, it is going to show up throughout this
chapter and those that follow, so here is a quick review of some of
its more useful exports. The <TT>string</TT> module
includes calls for searching and replacing:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>import string</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.find('xxxSPAMxxx', 'SPAM')            </B># return first offset
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.replace('xxaaxxaa', 'aa', 'SPAM')     </B># global replacement
'xxSPAMxxSPAM'

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.strip('\t  Ni\n')                     </B># remove whitespace
'Ni'</PRE>

<P class="docText">The <TT>string.find</TT> call returns the offset of the
first occurrence of a substring, and
<TT>string.replace</TT> does global search and replacement.
With this module, substrings are just strings; in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-18.html#python2-CHP-18">Chapter 18</A>, we'll also see modules that allow
regular expression <span class="docEmphasis">patterns</span> to show up in
searches and replacements. The <TT>string</TT> module also
provides constants and functions useful for things like case
conversions:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.lowercase                             </B># case constants, converters
'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.lower('SHRUBBERRY')</B>
'shrubberry'</PRE>

<P class="docText">There are also tools for splitting up strings around a substring
delimiter and putting them back together with a substring between.
We'll explore these tools later in this book, but as an
introduction, here they are at work:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.split('aaa+bbb+ccc', '+')</B>             # split into substrings list
['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc']
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.split('a b\nc\nd')</B>                    # default delimiter: whitespace
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.join(['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'], 'NI')</B>     # join substrings list
'aaaNIbbbNIccc'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.join(['A', 'dead', 'parrot'])</B>         # default delimiter: space
'A dead parrot'</PRE>

<P class="docText">These calls turn out to be surprisingly powerful. For example, a line
of data columns separated by tabs can be parsed into its columns with
a single <TT>split</TT> call; the
<I>more.py</I> script uses it to split a string into a
list of line strings. In fact, we can emulate the
<TT>string.replace</TT> call with a split/join combination:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.join(string.split('xxaaxxaa', 'aa'), 'SPAM')</B>   # replace the hard way
'xxSPAMxxSPAM'</PRE>

<P class="docText">For future reference, also keep in mind that Python doesn't
automatically convert strings to numbers, or vice versa; if you want
to use one like the other, you must say so, with manual conversions:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>string.atoi("42"), int("42"), eval("42")</B>     # string to int conversions
(42, 42, 42)

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>str(42), `42`, ("%d" % 42)</B>                   # int to string conversions
('42', '42', '42')

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>"42" + str(1), int("42") + 1 </B>                # concatenation, addition
('421', 43)</PRE>

<P class="docText">In the last command here, the first expression triggers string
concatenation (since both sides are strings) and the second invokes
integer addition (because both objects are numbers). Python
doesn't assume you meant one or the other and convert
automatically; as a rule of thumb, Python tries to avoid magic when
possible. String tools will be covered in more detail later in this
book (in fact, they get a full chapter in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-PART-IV.html#python2-PART-IV">Part IV</A>), but be sure to also see the library manual
for additional <TT>string</TT> module tools.

that means that these two lines would be equivalent:</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.3.5 File Operation Basics</H4>

<P class="docText">The <I>more.py</I> script also opens the external file
whose name is listed on the command line with the built-in
<TT>open</TT> function, and reads its text into memory all
at once with the file object <TT>read</TT> method. Since
file objects returned by <TT>open</TT> are part of the core
Python language itself, I assume that you have at least a passing
familiarity with them at this point in the text. But just in case
you've flipped into this chapter early on in your Pythonhood,
the calls:
</P>

<PRE>open('file').read(  )            # read entire file into string 
open('file').read(N)           # read next N bytes into string 
open('file').readlines(  )       # read entire file into line strings list
open('file').readline(  )        # read next line, through '\n'</PRE>

<P class="docText">load a file's contents into a string, load a fixed size set of
bytes into a string, load a file's contents into a list of line
strings, and load the next line in the file into a string,
respectively. As we'll see in a moment, these calls can also be
applied to shell commands in Python. File objects also have
<TT>write</TT> methods for sending strings to the
associated file. File-related topics are covered in depth later in
this chapter.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-3.6"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.3.6 Using Programs Two Ways</H4>

<P class="docText">The last few lines in the <I>more.py</I> file also
introduce one of the first big concepts in shell tool programming.
They instrument the file to be used two ways: as
<span class="docEmphasis">script</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">library</span>. Every
Python module has a built-in <TT>__name__</TT> variable
that is set by Python to the string <TT>__main__</TT>
only when the file is run as a program, not when imported as a
library. Because of that, the <TT>more</TT> function in
this file is executed automatically by the last line in the file when
this script is run as a top-level program, not when it is imported
elsewhere. This simple trick turns out to be one key to writing
reusable script code: by coding program logic as
<span class="docEmphasis">functions</span> instead of top-level code, it can also
be imported and reused in other scripts.
</P>

<P class="docText">The upshot is that we can either run <I>more.py</I> by
itself, or import and call its <TT>more</TT> function
elsewhere. When running the file as a top-level program, we list the
name of a file to be read and paged on the command line: as
we'll describe fully later in this chapter, words typed in the
command used to start a program show up in the built-in
<TT>sys.argv</TT> list in Python. For example, here is the
script file in action paging itself (be sure to type this command
line in your <I>PP2E\System</I> directory, or it
won't find the input file; I'll explain why later):
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\System&gt;<B>python more.py more.py</B>
#########################################################
# split and interactively page a string or file of text;

def more(text, numlines=15):
    lines = string.split(text, '\n')
    while lines:
        chunk = lines[:numlines]
More?<B>y</B>
        lines = lines[numlines:]
        for line in chunk: print line
        if lines and raw_input('More?') not in ['y', 'Y']: break

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys                             # when run, not imported
    more(open(sys.argv[1]).read(  ), 10)     # page contents of file on cmdline</PRE>

<P class="docText">When the <I>more.py</I> file is imported, we pass an
explicit string to its <TT>more</TT> function, and this is
exactly the sort of utility we need for documentation text. Running
this utility on the <TT>sys</TT> module's
documentation string gives us a bit more information about
what's available to scripts, in human-readable form:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>from more import more</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>more(sys.__doc__)</B>
This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the
interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

Dynamic objects:

argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
modules -- dictionary of loaded modules
exitfunc -- you may set this to a function to be called when Python exits

stdin -- standard input file object; used by raw_input(  ) and input(  )
stdout -- standard output file object; used by the print statement
stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
  By assigning another file object (or an object that behaves like a file)
  to one of these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.
More?</PRE>

<P class="docText">Pressing "y" (and the Enter key) here makes the function
display the next few lines of documentation, and then prompt again
unless you've run past the end of the lines list. Try this on
your own machine to see what the rest of the module's
documentation string looks like.
