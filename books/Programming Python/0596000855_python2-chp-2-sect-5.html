<H3 class="docSection1Title">2.5 The os Module</H3>

<P class="docText">As mentioned, <TT>os</TT> contains all the usual
operating-system calls you may have used in your C programs and shell
scripts. Its calls deal with directories, processes, shell variables,
and the like. Technically, this module provides
<span class="docEmphasis">POSIX</span> tools -- a portable standard for
operating-system calls -- along with platform-independent
directory processing tools as nested module
<TT>os.path</TT>. Operationally, <TT>os</TT>
serves as a largely portable interface to your computer's
system calls: scripts written with <TT>os</TT> and
<TT>os.path</TT> can usually be run on any platform
unchanged.
</P>

<P class="docText">In fact, if you read the <TT>os</TT> module's source
code, you'll notice that it really just imports whatever
platform-specific system module you have on your computer (e.g.,
<TT>nt</TT>, <TT>mac</TT>,
<TT>posix</TT>). See the file <I>os.py</I> in
the Python source library directory -- it simply runs a
<TT>from*</TT> statement to copy all names out of a
platform-specific module. By always importing <TT>os</TT>
instead of platform-specific modules, though, your scripts are mostly
immune to platform implementation differences.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.5.1 The Big os Lists</H4>

<P class="docText">Let's take a quick look at the basic interfaces in
<TT>os</TT>. If you inspect this module's attributes
interactively, you get a huge list of names that will vary per Python
release, will likely vary per platform, and isn't incredibly
useful until you've learned what each name means:

opened by your script are assumed to live, unless their names include
explicit directory paths. That's why I told you earlier to run
the following command in the directory where

<P class="docText">The input filename argument here is given without an explicit
directory path (though you could add one to page files in another

the <TT>os.chdir</TT> function to change to a new
directory; your code will run relative to the new directory for the
rest of the program (or until the next <TT>os.chdir</TT>
call). This chapter has more to say about the notion of a current
working directory, and its relation to module imports, when it

directory-related tools of its own. For example, it includes portable
functions for tasks such as checking a file's type

splitting and joining directory path strings, which automatically use
the directory name conventions on the platform on which Python is
running:

simply return the second and first items returned by a
<TT>split</TT> as a convenience, and
<TT>splitext</TT> strips the file extension (after the last
"."). This module also has an <TT>abspath</TT>
call that portably returns the absolute full directory pathname of a
file; it accounts for adding the current directory, ".."
parents, and more:

<P class="docText">Because filenames are relative to the current working directory when
they aren't fully specified paths, the
<TT>os.path.abspath</TT> function helps if you want to show
users what directory is truly being used to store a file. On Windows,
for example, when GUI-based programs are launched by clicking on file
explorer icons and desktop shortcuts, the execution directory of the
program is the clicked file's home directory, but that is not
always obvious to the person doing the clicking; printing a
file's <TT>abspath</TT> can help.

commands from within Python scripts. This concept is intertwined with
others we won't cover until later in this chapter, but since
this a key concept employed throughout this part of the book,
let's take a quick first look at the basics here. Two
<TT>os</TT> functions allow scripts to run any command line
that you can type in a console window:

</DL>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-5.5.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.5.5.1 What's a shell command?</H5>

<P class="docText">To understand the scope of these calls, we need to first define a few
terms. In this text the term <span class="docEmphasis">shell</span> means the
system that reads and runs command-line strings on your computer, and
<span class="docEmphasis">shell command</span> means a command-line string that
you would normally enter at your computer's shell prompt.
</P>

<P class="docText">For example, on Windows, you can start an MS-DOS console window and
type DOS commands there -- things like <I>dir</I> to
get a directory listing, <I>type</I> to view a file,
names of programs you wish to start, and so on. DOS is the system
shell, and commands like <span class="docEmphasis">dir</span> and
<I>type</I> are shell commands. On Linux, you can start a
new shell session by opening an xterm window and typing shell
commands there too -- <I>ls</I> to list directories,
<I>cat</I> to view files, and so on. There are a variety
of shells available on Unix (e.g., <TT>csh</TT>,
<TT>ksh</TT>), but they all read and run command lines.
Here are two shell commands typed and run in an MS-DOS console box on
Windows:

<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-5.5.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.5.5.2 Running shell commands</H5>

<P class="docText">None of this is directly related to Python, of course (despite the
fact that Python command-line scripts are sometimes confusingly
called "shell tools"). But because the
<TT>os</TT> module's <TT>system</TT> and
<TT>popen</TT> calls let Python scripts run any sort of
command that the underlying system shell understands, our scripts can
make use of every command-line tool available on the computer,
whether it's coded in Python or not. For example, here is some
Python code that runs the two DOS shell commands typed at the shell
prompt shown previously:
</P>

<PRE>C:\temp&gt;<B>python</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>import os</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.system('dir /B')</B>

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.system('type helloshell.py')</B>
# a Python program
print 'The Meaning of Life'
0</PRE>

<P class="docText">The "0"s at the end here are just the return values of
the <TT>system</TT> call itself. The
<TT>system</TT> call can be used to run any command line
that we could type at the shell's prompt (here,
<TT>C:\temp&gt;</TT>). The command's output normally
shows up in the Python session's or program's standard
output stream.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-5.5.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.5.5.3 Communicating with shell commands</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-9"></A>But what if we want to grab a
command's output within a script? The
<TT>os.system</TT> call simply runs a shell command line,
but <TT>os.popen</TT> also connects to the standard input
or output streams of the command -- we get back a
<span class="docEmphasis">file-like object</span> connected to the
command's output by default (if we pass a "w" mode
flag to <TT>popen</TT>, we connect to the command's
input stream instead). By using this object to read the output of a
command spawned with <TT>popen</TT>, we can intercept the
text that would normally appear in the console window where a command
line is typed:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>open('helloshell.py').read(  )</B>
"# a Python program\012print 'The Meaning of Life'\012"

'about-pp2e.html\012', 'about-ppr2e.html\012', 'newdir\012']</PRE>

<P class="docText">Here, we first fetch a file's content the usual way (using
Python files), then as the output of a shell <I>type</I>
command. Reading the output of a <I>dir</I> command lets
us get a listing of files in a directory which we can then process in
a loop (we'll meet other ways to obtain such a list later in
this chapter). So far, we've run basic DOS commands; because
these calls can run <span class="docEmphasis">any</span> command line that we can
type at a shell prompt, they can also be used to launch other Python
scripts:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.system('python helloshell.py')       </B># run a Python program
The Meaning of Life
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>output = os.popen('python helloshell.py').read(  )</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>output</B>
'The Meaning of Life\012'</PRE>

<P class="docText">In all of these examples, the command-line strings sent to
<TT>system</TT> and <TT>popen</TT> are hardcoded,
but there's no reason Python programs could not
<span class="docEmphasis">construct</span> such strings at runtime using normal
string operations (<TT>+</TT>, <TT>%</TT>, etc.).
Given that commands can be dynamically built and run this way,
<TT>system</TT> and <TT>popen</TT> turn Python
scripts into flexible and portable tools for launching and
orchestrating other programs. For example, a Python test
"driver" script can be used to run programs coded in any
language (e.g., C++, Java, Python) and analyze their outputs.
We'll explore such a script in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-4-SECT-4.html#python2-CHP-4-SECT-4">Section 4.4</A> in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-4.html#python2-CHP-4">Chapter 4</A>.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-5.5.4"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">2.5.5.4 Shell command limitations</H5>

<P class="docText">You should keep in mind two limitations of <TT>system</TT>
and <TT>popen</TT>. First, although these two functions
themselves are fairly portable, their use is really only as portable
as the commands that they run. The preceding examples that run DOS
<span class="docEmphasis">dir</span> and <I>type</I> shell
commands, for instance, work only on Windows, and would have to be
changed to run <I>ls</I> and <I>cat</I>
commands on Unix-like platforms. As I wrote this, the
<TT>popen</TT> call on Windows worked for command-line
programs only; it failed when called from a program running on
Windows with any sort of user interface (e.g., under the IDLE Python
development GUI). This has been improved in the Python 2.0
release -- <TT>popen</TT> now works much better on
Windows -- but this fix naturally works only on machines with the
latest version of Python installed.
</P>

<P class="docText">Second, it is important to remember that running Python files as
programs this way is very different, and generally much slower, than
importing program files and calling functions they define. When
<TT>os.system</TT> and <TT>os.popen</TT> are
called, they must start a brand-new independent program running on
your operating system (on Unix-like platforms, they run the command
in a newly forked process). When <span class="docEmphasis">importing</span> a
program file as a module, the Python interpreter simply loads and
runs the file's code in the same process, to generate a module
object. No other program is spawned along the way.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[5]</A></sup>
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[5]</A></sup> The Python <TT>execfile</TT> built-in function also
runs a program file's code, but within the same process that
called it. It's similar to an import in that regard, but works
more as if the file's text had been <span class="docEmphasis">pasted</span>
into the calling program at the place where the
<TT>execfile</TT> call appears (unless explicit global or
local namespace dictionaries are passed). Unlike imports,
<TT>execfile</TT> unconditionally reads and executes a
file's code (it may be run more than once per process), and no
module object is generated by the file's execution.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">There are good reasons to build systems as separate programs too, and
we'll later explore things like command-line arguments and
streams that allow programs to pass information back and forth. But
for most purposes, imported modules are a faster and more direct way
to compose systems.
</P>

<P class="docText">If you plan to use these calls in earnest, you should also know that
the <TT>os.system</TT> call normally
<span class="docEmphasis">blocks</span> (that is, pauses) its caller until the
spawned command line exits. On Linux and Unix-like platforms, the
spawned command can generally be made to run independently and in
parallel with the caller, by adding an <TT>&amp;</TT> shell
background operator at the end of the command line:
</P>

<PRE>os.system("python program.py arg arg &amp;")</PRE>

<P class="docText">On Windows, spawning with a DOS <span class="docEmphasis">start</span> command
will usually launch the command in parallel too:
</P>

<PRE>os.system("start program.py arg arg")</PRE>

<P class="docText">The <TT>os.popen</TT> call generally does not block its
caller -- by definition, the caller must be able to read or write
the file object returned -- but callers may still occasionally
become blocked under both Windows and Linux if the pipe object is
closed (e.g., when garbage is collected) before the spawned program
exits, or the pipe is read exhaustively (e.g., with its
<TT>read( )</TT> method). As we will see in the next
chapter, the Unix <TT>os.fork/exec</TT> and Windows
<TT>os.spawnv</TT> calls can also be used to run parallel

<P class="docText">Because the <TT>os</TT> <TT>system</TT> and
<TT>popen</TT> calls also fall under the category of
program launchers, stream redirectors, and cross-process
communication devices, they will show up again in later parts of this
and the following chapters, so we'll defer further details for
the time being.<A NAME="IXTR3-53"></A>

<P class="docText">Since most other <TT>os</TT> module tools are even more
difficult to appreciate outside the context of larger application
topics, we'll postpone a deeper look until later sections. But
to let you sample the flavor of this module, here is a quick preview
for reference. Among the <TT>os</TT> module's other
weapons are these:

<P class="docText">And so on. One caution up front: the <TT>os</TT> module
provides a set of file open, read, and write calls, but these all
deal with low-level file access and are entirely distinct from
Python's built-in <TT>stdio</TT> file objects that we
create with the built-in <TT>open</TT> function. You should
normally use the built-in <TT>open</TT> function (not the
<TT>os</TT> module) for all but very special
file-processing needs.
</P>

<P class="docText">Throughout this chapter, we will apply <TT>sys</TT> and
<TT>os</TT> tools such as these to implement common
system-level tasks, but this book doesn't have space to provide
an exhaustive list of the contents of the modules we meet along the
way. If you have not already done so, you should become acquainted
with the contents of modules like <TT>os</TT> and
<TT>sys</TT> by consulting the Python library manual. For
now, let's move on to explore additional system tools, in the
context of broader system programming concepts.
