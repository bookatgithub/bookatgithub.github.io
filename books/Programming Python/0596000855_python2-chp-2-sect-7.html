<H3 class="docSection1Title">2.7 Current Working Directory</H3>

<P class="docText">The notion of the current working directory (CWD) turns out to be a
key concept in some scripts' execution: it's always the
implicit place where files processed by the script are assumed to
reside, unless their names have absolute directory paths. As we saw
earlier, <TT>os.getcwd</TT> lets a script fetch the CWD
name explicitly, and <TT>os.chdir</TT> allows a script to
move to a new CWD.
</P>

<P class="docText">Keep in mind, though, that filenames without full pathnames map to
the CWD, and have nothing to do with your PYTHONPATH setting.
Technically, the CWD is always where a script is launched from, not
the directory containing the script file. Conversely,
<span class="docEmphasis">imports</span> always first search the directory
containing the script, not the CWD (unless the script happens to also
be located in the CWD). Since this distinction is subtle and tends to
trip up beginners, let's explore it in more detail.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-7.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.7.1 CWD, Files, and Import Paths</H4>

<P class="docText">When you run a Python script by typing a shell command line like
<TT>python</TT> <TT>dir1\dir2\file.py</TT>, the
CWD is the directory you were in when you typed this command, not
<I>dir1\dir2</I>. On the other hand, Python
automatically adds the identity of the script's home directory
to the front of the module search path, such that
<I>file.py</I> can always import other files in
<I>dir1\dir2</I>, no matter where it is run from. To
illustrate, let's write a simple script to echo both its CWD
and module search path:
</P>

<PRE>C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System&gt;<B>type whereami.py</B>
import os, sys
print 'my os.getcwd =&gt;', os.getcwd(  )            # show my cwd execution dir
print 'my sys.path  =&gt;', sys.path[:6]           # show first 6 import paths
raw_input(  )                                     # wait for keypress if clicked</PRE>

<P class="docText">Now, running this script in the directory in which it resides sets
the CWD as expected, and adds an empty string (<TT>''</TT>)
to the front of the module search path, to designate the CWD (we met
the <TT>sys.path</TT> module search path earlier):
</P>

<PRE>C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System&gt;<B>set PYTHONPATH=C:\PP2ndEd\examples</B>
C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System&gt;<B>python whereami.py</B>
my os.getcwd =&gt; C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System
my sys.path  =&gt; ['', 'C:\\PP2ndEd\\examples', 'C:\\Program Files\\Python
\\Lib\\plat-win', 'C:\\Program Files\\Python\\Lib', 'C:\\Program Files\\
Python\\DLLs', 'C:\\Program Files\\Python\\Lib\\lib-tk']</PRE>

<P class="docText">But if we run this script from other places, the CWD moves with us
(it's the directory where we type commands), and Python adds a
directory to the front of the module search path that allows the
script to still see files in its own home directory. For instance,
when running from one level up (<TT>".."</TT>), the
"System" name added to the front of
<TT>sys.path</TT> will be the first directory Python
searches for imports within <I>whereami.py </I>; it
points imports back to the directory containing the script run.
Filenames without complete paths, though, will be mapped to the CWD
(<I>C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E </I>), not the
<I>System</I> subdirectory nested there:
</P>

<PRE>C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System&gt;<B>cd .. </B>
C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E&gt;<B>python System\whereami.py </B>
my os.getcwd =&gt; C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E
my sys.path  =&gt; ['System', 'C:\\PP2ndEd\\examples', <I>... </I><I> rest same</I><I>...  </I>]

C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E&gt;<B>cd .. </B>
C:\PP2ndEd\examples&gt;<B>python PP2E\System\whereami.py </B>
my os.getcwd =&gt; C:\PP2ndEd\examples
my sys.path  =&gt; ['PP2E\\System', 'C:\\PP2ndEd\\examples', <I>... </I><I> rest same</I><I>... </I> ]

C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System&gt;<B>cd PP2E\System\App </B>
C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System\App&gt;<B>python ..\whereami.py </B>
my os.getcwd =&gt; C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System\App
my sys.path  =&gt; ['..', 'C:\\PP2ndEd\\examples', <I>... </I><I> rest same</I><I>... </I> ]</PRE>

<P class="docText">The net effect is that <span class="docEmphasis">filenames</span> without
directory paths in a script will be mapped to the place where the
command was typed (<TT>os.getcwd</TT>), but
<span class="docEmphasis">imports</span> still have access to the directory of
the script being run (via the front of <TT>sys.path</TT>).
Finally, when a file is launched by clicking its icon, the CWD is
just the directory that contains the clicked file. The following
output, for example, appears in a new DOS console box, when
<I>whereami.py</I> is double-clicked in Windows
explorer:
</P>

<PRE>my os.getcwd =&gt; C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\System
my sys.path  =&gt; ['C:\\PP2NDED\\EXAMPLES\\PP2E\\SYSTEM', 'C:\\PP2ndEd\\examples',
'C:\\Program Files\\Python\\Lib\\plat-win', 'C:\\Program Files\\Python\\Lib',
'C:\\Program Files\\Python\\DLLs']</PRE>

<P class="docText">In this case, both the CWD used for filenames and the first import
search directory are the directory containing the script file. This
all usually works out just as you expect, but there are two pitfalls
to avoid:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">Filenames might need to include complete directory paths if scripts
cannot be sure from where they will be run.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Command-line scripts cannot use the CWD to gain import visibility to
files not in their own directories; instead, use PYTHONPATH settings
and package import paths to access modules in other directories.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">For example, files in this book can always import other files in
their own <span class="docEmphasis">home directories</span> without package path
imports, regardless of how they are run (<TT>import</TT>
<TT>filehere</TT>) but must go through the
<I>PP2E</I> package root to find files anywhere else in
the examples tree (<TT>from</TT>
<TT>PP2E.dir1.dir2</TT> <TT>import</TT>
<TT>filethere</TT>) even if they are run from the directory
containing the desired external module. As usual for modules, the
<I>PP2E\dir1\dir2</I> directory name could also be
added to PYTHONPATH to make <TT>filethere</TT> visible
everywhere without package path imports (though adding more
directories to PYTHONPATH increases the likelihood of name clashes).
In either case, though, imports are always resolved to the
script's home directory or other Python search path settings,
not the CWD.

<A NAME="python2-CHP-2-SECT-7.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">2.7.2 CWD and Command Lines</H4>

<P class="docText">This distinction between the CWD and import search paths explains why
many scripts in this book designed to operate in the current working
directory (instead of one whose name is passed in) are run with
command lines like this:
</P>

<PRE>C:\temp&gt;<B>python %X%\PyTools\cleanpyc-py.py                </B>  <I> process cwd</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">In this example, the Python script file itself lives in the directory
<I>C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E\PyTools</I>, but because it
is run from <I>C:\temp</I>, it processes the files
located in <I>C:\temp</I> (i.e., in the CWD, not in the
script's home directory). To process files elsewhere with such
a script, simply <I>cd</I> to the directory to be
processed to change the CWD:
</P>

<PRE>C:\temp&gt;<B>cd C:\PP2nEd\examples </B>
C:\PP2ndEd\examples&gt;<B>python %X%\PyTools\cleanpyc-py.py     </B> <I> process cwd</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">Because the CWD is always implied, a <I>cd</I> tells the
script which directory to process in no less certain terms that
passing a directory name to the script explicitly like this:
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\PyTools&gt;<B>python find.py *.py C:\temp        </B>   <I> process named dir</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">In this command line, the CWD is the directory containing the script
to be run (notice that the script filename has no directory path
prefix); but since this script processes a directory named explicitly
on the command line (<I>C:\temp</I>), the CWD is
irrelevant. Finally, if we want to run such a script located in some
other directory to process files located in some other directory, we
can simply give directory paths to both:
</P>

<PRE>C:\temp&gt;<B>python %X%\PyTools\find.py *.cxx C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Here, the script has import visibility to files in its
<I>PP2E\PyTools</I> home directory and processes files
in the <I>PP2E</I> root, but the CWD is something else
entirely (<I>C:\temp</I>). This last form is more to
type, of course, but watch for a variety of CWD and explicit
script-path command lines like these in this book.

<P class="docText">Whenever you see a <TT>%X%</TT> in command lines like those

<I>PP2E</I> book examples package root directory, which
I use to point to scripts' files. On my machines, it is preset
in my <TT>PP2E\Config setup-pp*</TT> files like this:</P>

<PRE>set X=C:\PP2ndEd\examples\PP2E --DOS
setenv X /home/mark/PP2ndEd/examples/PP2E --Unix/csh</PRE> 

<P class="docText">That is, it is assigned and expanded to
the directory where <I>PP2E</I> lives on the system.
See the <TT>Config\setup-pp*</TT> files for more details,
and see later in this chapter for more on shell variables. You can
instead type full paths everywhere you see <TT>%X%</TT> in
this book, but your fingers and your keyboard are probably both
better off if you set <TT>X</TT> to your examples root.
