<H3 class="docSection1Title">2.8 Command-Line Arguments</H3>

<P class="docText">The <TT>sys</TT> module is also where Python makes
available the words typed on the command used to start a Python
script. These words are usually referred to as <span class="docEmphasis">command-line
arguments</span>, and show up in <TT>sys.argv</TT>, a
built-in list of strings. C programmers may notice its similarity to
the C "argv" array (an array of C strings). It's
not much to look at interactively, because no command-line arguments
are passed to start up Python in this mode:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>sys.argv</B>
['']</PRE>

<P class="docText">To really see what arguments are about, we need to run a script from
the shell command line. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-2-EX-2">Example 2-2</A> shows an
unreasonably simple one that just prints the <TT>argv</TT>
list for inspection.
</P>


<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="python2-CHP-2-EX-2"></A>Example 2-2. PP2E\System\testargv.py </H5>
<PRE>import sys
print sys.argv</PRE>


<P class="docText">Running this script prints the command-line arguments list; note that
the first item is always the name of the executed Python script file
itself, no matter how the script was started (see <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-2-SIDEBAR-3">Executable Scripts on Unix</A> later in this chapter):
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\System&gt;<B>python testargv.py</B>
['testargv.py']

C:\...\PP2E\System&gt;<B>python testargv.py spam eggs cheese</B>
['testargv.py', 'spam', 'eggs', 'cheese']

C:\...\PP2E\System&gt;<B>python testargv.py -i data.txt -o results.txt</B>
['testargv.py', '-i', 'data.txt', '-o', 'results.txt']</PRE>

<P class="docText">The last command here illustrates a common convention. Much like
function arguments, command-line options are sometimes passed by
position, and sometimes by name using a "-name value"
word pair. For instance, the pair <TT>-i</TT>
<TT>data.txt</TT> means the <TT>-i</TT>
option's value is <TT>data.txt</TT> (e.g., an input
filename). Any words can be listed, but programs usually impose some
sort of structure on them.
</P>

<P class="docText">Command-line arguments play the same role in programs that function
arguments do in functions: they are simply a way to pass information
to a program that can vary per program run. Because they don't
have to be hardcoded, they allow scripts to be more generally useful.
For example, a file-processing script can use a command-line argument
as the name of the file it should process; see the
<I>more.py</I> script we met in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-2-SECT-3.html#python2-CHP-2-EX-1">Example 2-1</A> for a prime example. Other scripts might
accept processing mode flags, Internet addresses, and so on.
</P>

<P class="docText">Once you start using command-line arguments regularly, though,
you'll probably find it inconvenient to keep writing code that
fishes through the list looking for words. More typically, programs
translate the arguments list on startup into structures more
conveniently processed. Here's one way to do it: the script in
<A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-2-EX-3">Example 2-3</A> scans the <TT>argv</TT> list
looking for <TT>-optionname</TT>
<TT>optionvalue</TT> word pairs, and stuffs them into a
dictionary by option name for easy retrieval.
</P>


<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="python2-CHP-2-EX-3"></A>Example 2-3. PP2E\System\testargv2.py </H5>
<PRE># collect command-line options in a dictionary

def getopts(argv):
    opts = {}
    while argv:
        if argv[0][0] == '-':                  # find "-name value" pairs
            opts[argv[0]] = argv[1]            # dict key is "-name" arg
            argv = argv[2:]                    
        else:
            argv = argv[1:]
    return opts

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from sys import argv                       # example client code
    myargs = getopts(argv)
    if myargs.has_key('-i'):
        print myargs['-i']
    print myargs</PRE>


<P class="docText">You might import and use such a function in all your command-line
tools. When run by itself, this file just prints the formatted
argument dictionary:
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\System&gt;<B>python testargv2.py</B>
{}

C:\...\PP2E\System&gt;<B>python testargv2.py -i data.txt -o results.txt</B>
data.txt
{'-o': 'results.txt', '-i': 'data.txt'}</PRE>

<P class="docText">Naturally, we could get much more sophisticated here in terms of
argument patterns, error checking, and the like. We could also use
standard and more advanced command-line processing tools in the
Python library to parse arguments; see module
<TT>getopt</TT> in the library manual for another option.
In general, the more configurable your scripts, the more you must
invest on command-line processing logic complexity.

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">Executable Scripts on Unix</H2>

<P class="docText">Unix and Linux users: you can also make text files of Python source
code directly executable by adding a special line at the top with the
path to the Python interpreter and giving the file executable
permission. For instance, type this code into a text file called
"myscript":
</P>

<PRE>#!/usr/bin/python
print 'And nice red uniforms'</PRE>

<P class="docText">The first line is normally taken as a comment by Python (it starts
with a <TT>#</TT>); but when this file is run, the
operating system sends lines in this file to the interpreter listed
after <TT>#!</TT> on line 1. If this file is made directly
executable with a shell command of the form <TT>chmod +x
myscript</TT>, it can be run directly, without typing
<TT>python</TT> in the command, as though it were a binary
executable program:
</P>

<PRE>% <B>myscript a b c</B>
And nice red uniforms</PRE>

<P class="docText">When run this way, <TT>sys.argv</TT> will still have the
script's name as the first word in the list:
["myscript", "a", "b",
"c"], exactly as if the script had been run with the more
explicit and portable command form <TT>python</TT>
<TT>myscript</TT> <TT>a</TT> <TT>b</TT>
<TT>c</TT>. Making scripts directly executable is really a
Unix trick, not a Python feature, but it's worth pointing out
that it can be made a bit less machine-dependent by listing the Unix
<I>env</I> command at the top instead of a hardcoded path
to the Python executable:
</P>

<PRE>#!/usr/bin/env python
print 'Wait for it...'</PRE>

<P class="docText">When coded this way, the operating system will employ your
environment variable settings to locate your Python interpreter (your
PATH variable, on most platforms). If you run the same script on many
machines, you need only change your environment settings on each
machine, not edit Python script code. Of course, you can always run
Python files with a more explicit command line:
</P>

<PRE>% <B>python myscript a b c</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">This assumes that the <TT>python</TT> interpreter program
is on your system's search path setting (else you need to type
its full path), but works on any Python platform with a command line.
Since this is more portable, I generally use this convention in the
book's examples, but consult your Unix man pages for more
details on any of the topics mentioned here. Even so, these special
<TT>#!</TT> lines will show up in many examples in this
book just in case readers want to run them as executables on Unix or
Linux; on other platforms, they are simply ignored as Python
comments. Note that on Windows NT/2000, you can usually type a
script's filename directly (without the "python"
word) to make it go too, and you don't have to add a
<TT>#!</TT> line at the top.
