<H3 class="docSection1Title">21.10 Postscript to the Second Edition</H3>

<P class="docText">One of the luxuries of updating a book like this is that you get an
opportunity to debate yourself, or at least your opinions, from years
past. With the benefit of five years' retrospect, I'd
like to add a few comments to the original conclusion.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-21-SECT-10.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">21.10.1 Integration Isn't Everything</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-21-338287"></A>The conclusion for this book's first
edition stressed the importance of Python's role as an
integration tool. Although the themes underscored there are still
valid, I should point out that not all Python applications rely
explicitly on the ability to be mixed with components written in
other languages. Many developers now use Python in standalone mode,
either not having or not noticing integration layers.
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, developers who code CGI Internet scripts with Python
often code in pure Python. Somewhere down the call chain, C libraries
are called (to access sockets, databases, and so on), but Python
coders often don't need to care. In fact, this has proven to be
true in my own recent experience as well. While working on the new
GUI, system, and Internet examples for this edition, I worked purely
in Python for long periods of time. A few months later I also worked
on a Python/C++ integration framework, but this integration project
was entirely separate from the pure Python book examples programming
effort. Many projects are implemented in Python alone.
</P>

<P class="docText">That is not to say that Python's integration potential is not
one of its most profound attributes -- indeed, most Python systems
<span class="docEmphasis">are</span> composed of combinations of Python and C.
However, in many cases, the integration layer is implemented once by
a handful of advanced developers, while others perform the bulk of
the programming in Python alone. If you're fortunate enough to
count yourself among the latter group, Python's overall ease of
use may seem more crucial than its integration role.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-21-SECT-10.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">21.10.2 The End of the Java Wars</H4>

<P class="docText">In 1995, the Python community perceived a conflict between Java and
Python in terms of competition for developer mind-share -- hence
the sidebar "Python versus Java: Round 1?" in the first
edition. Since then, this has become virtually a nonissue; I've
even deleted this sidebar completely.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-21-338288"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-21-338289"></A>This cooling of hostilities has come about
partly because Java's role is now better understood: Java is
recognized as a <span class="docEmphasis">systems development</span> language,
not a scripting language. That is essentially what the sidebar
proposed. Java's complexity is on the order of C++'s
(from which it is derived), making it impractical for scripting work,
where short development cycles are at a premium. This is by
design -- Java is meant for tasks where the extra complexity may
make sense. Given the great disparity in their roles, the Python/Java
conflict has fizzled.
</P>

<P class="docText">The truce has also been called on account of the new
<span class="docEmphasis">JPython</span> implementation of Python. JPython was
described in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A> ; in short, it integrates
Python and Java programs such that applications can be developed as
hybrids: parts can be coded in Python when scripting is warranted,
and in Java for performance-intensive parts. This is exactly the
argument made for C/C++ integration in the conclusion of the first
edition; thanks to JPython, the same reasoning behind hybrid systems
now applies to Java-based applications.
</P>

<P class="docText">The claims made by the old Java sidebar are still true -- Python
is simpler, more open, and easier to learn and apply. But that is as
it should be: as a scripting language, Python naturally complements
systems languages like Java and C++, rather than competing with them.
There are still some who would argue that Python is better suited for
many applications now coded in Java. But just as for Python and C and
C++, Python and Java seem to work best as a team.
</P>

<P class="docText">It's also worth noting that as I write these words, Microsoft
has just announced a new, proprietary language called C# that seems
to be intended as a substitute for Java in Microsoft's systems
language offerings. Moreover, a new Python port to the C#/.NET
environment has been announced as well. See <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A> for details -- this port is roughly to C#
what JPython is to Java. Time will tell if C# and Java will do battle
for mindshare. But given that Python integrates with both, the
outcome of these clashes between mega-companies is largely
irrelevant; Pythonistas can watch calmly from the sidelines this time
around.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-CHP-21-SECT-10.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">21.10.3 We're Not Off That Island Yet</H4>

<P class="docText">As I mentioned in the preface to this edition, Python has come far in
the last five years. Companies around the world have adopted it, and
Python now boasts a user base estimated at half a million strong. Yet
for all the progress, there is still work to be done, both in
improving and popularizing Python, and in simplifying software
development in general.
</P>

<P class="docText">As I travel around the world teaching Python classes at companies and
organizations, I still meet many people who are utterly frustrated
with the development tools they are required to use in their jobs.
Some even change jobs (or careers) because of such frustrations. Even
well after the onset of the Internet revolution, development is still
harder than it needs to be.
</P>

<P class="docText">On the other hand, I also meet people who find Python so much fun to
use, they can't imagine going back to their old ways. They use
Python both on and off the job for the pure pleasure of programming.
</P>

<P class="docText">Five years from now, I hope to report that I meet many more people in
the latter category than the former. After all, Guido may have
appeared on the covers of <span class="docEmphasis">Linux Journal</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">Dr. Dobb's</span> since the first edition of this
book, but we still have a bit more work to do before he makes the
cover of <span class="docEmphasis">Rolling Stone</span>.

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">A Morality Tale of Perl Versus Python</H2>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-21-338290"></A>(The following was posted recently to the
<span class="docEmphasis">rec.humor.funny</span> Usenet newsgroup by Larry
Hastings, and is reprinted here with the original author's
permission. I don't necessarily condone language wars; okay?)
</P>

<P class="docText">This has been percolating in the back of my mind for a while.
It's a scene from <span class="docEmphasis">The Empire Strikes Back</span>,
reinterpreted to serve a valuable moral lesson for aspiring
programmers.

<P class="docText">EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- DAY </P>

<P class="docText">With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick
vines that grow in the swamp until he reaches the Dagobah statistics
lab. Panting heavily, he continues his exercises -- grepping,
installing new packages, logging in as root, and writing replacements
for two-year-old shell scripts in Python.
</P>

<P class="docText">YODA: Code! Yes. A programmer's strength flows from code
maintainability. But beware of Perl. Terse syntax . . . more than one
way to do it . . . default variables. The dark side of code
maintainability are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you when
code you write. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it
dominate your destiny, consume you it will.
</P>

<P class="docText">LUKE: Is Perl better than Python? </P>

<P class="docText">YODA: No . . . no . . . no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. </P>

<P class="docText">LUKE: But how will I know why Python is better than Perl? </P>

<P class="docText">YODA: You will know. When your code you try to read six months from
now.
