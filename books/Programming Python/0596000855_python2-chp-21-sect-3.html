<H3 class="docSection1Title">21.3 The "Gilligan Factor"</H3>

<P class="docText">It has been suggested (tongue in cheek) that if there were a patron
saint of software engineers, the honor would fall on none other than
Gilligan, the character in the pervasively popular American
television show of the 1960s, <span class="docEmphasis">Gilligan's
Island</span>. Gilligan is the enigmatic, sneaker-clad first
mate, widely held to be responsible for the shipwreck that stranded
the now-residents of the island.
</P>

<P class="docText">To be sure, Gilligan's situation seems oddly familiar. Stranded
on a desert island with only the most meager of modern technological
comforts, Gilligan and his cohorts must resort to scratching out a
living using the resources naturally available. In episode after
episode, we observe the Professor developing exquisitely intricate
tools for doing the business of life on their remote island, only to
be foiled in the implementation phase by the ever-bungling Gilligan.
</P>

<P class="docText">But clearly it was never poor Gilligan's fault. How could one
possibly be expected to implement designs for such sophisticated
applications as home appliances and telecommunications devices, given
the rudimentary technologies available in such an environment? He
simply lacked the proper tools. For all we know, Gilligan may have
had the capacity for engineering on the grandest level. But you
can't get there with bananas and coconuts.
</P>

<P class="docText">And pathologically, time after time, Gilligan wound up inadvertently
sabotaging the best of the Professor's plans; misusing,
abusing, and eventually destroying his inventions. If he could just
pedal his makeshift stationary bicycle faster and faster (he was led
to believe), all would be well. But in the end, inevitably, the
coconuts were sent hurling into the air, the palm branches came
crashing down around his head, and poor Gilligan was blamed once
again for the failure of the technology.
</P>

<P class="docText">Dramatic though this image may be, some observers would consider it a
striking metaphor for the software industry. Like Gilligan, we
software engineers are often asked to perform tasks with arguably
inappropriate tools. Like Gilligan, our intentions are sound, but
technology can hold us back. And like poor Gilligan, we inevitably
must bear the brunt of management's wrath when our systems are
delivered behind schedule. You can't get there with bananas and
coconuts . . .
