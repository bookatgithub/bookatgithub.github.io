<H3 class="docSection1Title">21.7 On Sinking the Titanic</H3>

<P class="docText">In short, Python is really more than a language; it implies a
development philosophy. The concepts of prototyping, rapid
development, and hybrid applications certainly aren't new. But
while the benefits of such development modes are widely recognized,
there has been a lack of tools that make them practical without
sacrificing programming power. This is one of the main gaps that
Python's design fills: <span class="docEmphasis">Python provides a simple but
powerful rapid development language, along with the integration tools
needed to apply it in realistic development
environments.</span><A NAME="IXT-21-338279"></A>
</P>

<P class="docText">This combination arguably makes Python unique among similar tools.
For instance, Tcl is a good integration tool but not a full-blown
language; Perl is a powerful system administration language but a
weak integration tool. But Python's marriage of a powerful
dynamic language and integration opens the door to fundamentally
faster development modes. With Python, it's no longer necessary
to choose between fast development and fast
execution.<A NAME="IXT-21-338280"></A>
</P>

<P class="docText">By now, it should be clear that a single programming language
can't satisfy all our development goals. In fact, our needs are
sometimes contradictory: the goals of efficiency and flexibility will
probably always clash. Given the high cost of making software, the
choice between development and execution speed is crucial. Although
machine cycles are cheaper than programmers, we can't yet
ignore efficiency completely.
</P>

<P class="docText">But with a tool like Python, we don't need to decide between
the two goals at all. Just as a carpenter wouldn't drive a nail
with a chainsaw, software engineers are now empowered to use the
right tool for the task at hand: Python when speed of development
matters, compiled languages when efficiency dominates, and
combinations of the two when our goals are not absolute.
</P>

<P class="docText">Moreover, we don't have to sacrifice code reuse or rewrite
exhaustively for delivery when applying rapid development with
Python. We can have our rapid development cake and eat it too:

<P class="docList">Because Python is designed for use in mixed-language systems, we

<P class="docText">In typical Python development, a system's frontend and
infrastructure may be written in Python for ease of development and
modification, but the kernel is still written in C or C++ for
efficiency. Python has been called the tip of the iceberg in such
systems -- the part visible to end users of a package, as captured
in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-21-FIG-6">Figure 21-6</A>.

<P class="docText">Such an architecture uses the best of both worlds: it can be extended
by adding more Python code or by writing C extension modules,
depending on performance requirements. But this is just one of many
mixed-language development scenarios:
