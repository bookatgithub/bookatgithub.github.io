<P class="docText">I hope this book has taught you something about Python, both the
language and its roles. Beyond this text, there is really no
substitute for doing some original Python programming. Be sure to
grab a reference source or two to help you along the way.
</P>

<P class="docText">The task of programming computers will probably always be
challenging. Perhaps happily, there will continue to be a need for
intelligent software engineers, skilled at translating real-world
tasks into computer-executable form, at least for the foreseeable
future. (After all, if it were too easy, none of us would get paid.
:-)
</P>

<P class="docText">But current development practice and tools make our tasks
unnecessarily difficult: many of the obstacles faced by software
developers are purely artificial. We have come far in our quest to
improve the speed of computers; the time has come to focus our
attentions on improving the speed of development. In an era of
constantly shrinking schedules, productivity must be paramount.
</P>

<P class="docText">Python, as a mixed-paradigm tool, has the potential to foster
development modes that simultaneously leverage the benefits of rapid
development and of traditional languages. While Python won't
solve all the problems of the software industry, it offers hope for
making programming simpler, faster, and at least a little more
enjoyable.
</P>

<P class="docText">It may not get us off that island altogether, but it sure beats
bananas and coconuts.
