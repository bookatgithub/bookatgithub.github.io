<H3 class="docSection1Title">3.2 Forking Processes</H3>

<P class="docText">Forked processes are the traditional way to structure parallel tasks,
and are a fundamental part of the Unix tool set. Forking is based on
the notion of <span class="docEmphasis">copying</span> programs: when a program
calls the fork routine, the operating system makes a new copy of that
program in memory, and starts running that copy in parallel with the
original. Some systems don't really copy the original program
(it's an expensive operation), but the new copy works as if it
was a literal copy.
</P>

<P class="docText">After a fork operation, the original copy of the program is called
the <span class="docEmphasis">parent</span> process, and the copy created by
<TT>os.fork</TT> is called the <span class="docEmphasis">child</span>
process. In general, parents can make any number of children, and
children can create child processes of their own -- all forked
processes run independently and in parallel under the operating
system's control. It is probably simpler in practice than
theory, though; the Python script in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-1">Example 3-1</A>
forks new child processes until you type a "q" at the
console.
</P>


<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="python2-CHP-3-EX-1"></A>Example 3-1. PP2E\System\Processes\fork1.py </H5>
<PRE># forks child processes until you type 'q'

import os

def child(  ):
    print 'Hello from child',  os.getpid(  )
    os._exit(0)  # else goes back to parent loop

def parent(  ):
    while 1:
        newpid = os.fork(  )
        if newpid == 0:
            child(  )
        else:
            print 'Hello from parent', os.getpid(  ), newpid
        if raw_input(  ) == 'q': break

parent(  )</PRE>


<P class="docText">Python's process forking tools, available in the
<TT>os</TT> module, are simply thin wrappers over standard
forking calls in the C library. To start a new, parallel process,
call the <TT>os.fork</TT> built-in function. Because this
function generates a copy of the calling program, it returns a
different value in each copy: zero in the child process, and the
process ID of the new child in the parent. Programs generally test
this result to begin different processing in the child only; this
script, for instance, runs the <TT>child</TT> function in
child processes only.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[2]</A></sup>
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[2]</A></sup> At least in the current Python
implementation, calling <TT>os.fork</TT> in a Python script
actually copies the Python interpreter process (if you look at your
process list, you'll see two Python entries after a fork). But
since the Python interpreter records everything about your running
script, it's okay to think of <TT>fork</TT> as
copying your program directly. It really will, if Python scripts are
ever compiled to binary machine code.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Unfortunately, this won't work on Windows today;
<TT>fork</TT> is at odds with the Windows model, and a port
of this call is still in the works. But because forking is ingrained
into the Unix programming model, this script works well on Unix and
Linux:
</P>

<PRE>[mark@toy]$ <B>python fork1.py</B>
Hello from parent 671 672
Hello from child 672

Hello from parent 671 673
Hello from child 673

Hello from parent 671 674
Hello from child 674
<B>q</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">These messages represent three forked child processes; the unique
identifiers of all the processes involved are fetched and displayed
with the <TT>os.getpid</TT> call. A subtle point: The
<TT>child</TT> process function is also careful to exit
explicitly with an <TT>os._exit</TT> call. We'll
discuss this call in more detail later in this chapter, but if
it's not made, the child process would live on after the
<TT>child</TT> function returns (remember, it's just
a copy of the original process). The net effect is that the child
would go back to the loop in <TT>parent</TT> and start
forking children of its own (i.e., the parent would have
grandchildren). If you delete the exit call and rerun, you'll
likely have to type more than one "q" to stop, because
multiple processes are running in the <TT>parent</TT>
function.
</P>

<P class="docText">In <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-1">Example 3-1</A>, each process exits very soon after
it starts, so there's little overlap in time. Let's do
something slightly more sophisticated to better illustrate multiple
forked processes running in parallel. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-2">Example 3-2</A>
starts up 10 copies of itself, each copy counting up to 10 with a
one-second delay between iterations. The
<TT>time.sleep</TT> built-in call simply pauses the calling
process for a number of seconds (pass a floating-point value to pause
for fractions of seconds).

<P class="docText">The output of all these processes shows up on the same screen,
because they all share the standard output stream. Technically, a
forked process gets a copy of the original process's global
memory, including open file descriptors. Because of that, global
objects like files start out with the same values in a child process.
But it's important to remember that global memory is copied,
not shared -- if a child process changes a global object, it
changes its own copy only. (As we'll see, this works
differently in threads, the topic of the next section.)

<P class="docText">If you've done much Unix development, the
<TT>fork</TT>/<TT>exec</TT> combination will
probably look familiar. The main thing to notice is the
<TT>os.execlp</TT> call in this code. In a nutshell, this
call <span class="docEmphasis">overlays</span> (i.e., replaces) the program
running in the current process with another program. Because of that,
the <span class="docEmphasis">combination</span> of <TT>os.fork</TT>
and <TT>os.execlp</TT> means start a new process, and run a
new program in that process -- in other words, launch a new
program in parallel with the original program.

<H5 class="docSection3Title">3.2.1.1 os.exec call formats</H5>

<P class="docText">The arguments to <TT>os.execlp</TT> specify the program to
be run by giving command-line arguments used to start the program
(i.e., what Python scripts know as <TT>sys.argv</TT>). If
successful, the new program begins running and the call to
<TT>os.execlp</TT> itself never returns (since the original
program has been replaced, there's really nothing to return
to). If the call does return, an error has occurred, so we code an
<TT>assert</TT> after it that will always raise an
exception if reached.
</P>

<P class="docText">There are a handful of <TT>os.exec</TT> variants in the
Python standard library; some allow us to configure environment
variables for the new program, pass command-line arguments in
different forms, and so on. All are available on both Unix and
Windows, and replace the calling program (i.e., the Python
interpreter). <TT>exec</TT> comes in eight flavors, which

<P class="docText">So, when the script in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-3">Example 3-3</A> calls
