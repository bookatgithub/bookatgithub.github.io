<H3 class="docSection1Title">3.6 Pipes</H3>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-58"></A>Pipes,
another cross-program communication device, are made available in
Python with the built-in <TT>os.pipe</TT> call. Pipes are
unidirectional channels that work something like a shared memory
buffer, but with an interface resembling a simple file on each of two
ends. In typical use, one program writes data on one end of the pipe,
and another reads that data on the other end. Each program only sees
its end of the pipes, and processes it using normal Python file
calls.
</P>

<P class="docText">Pipes are much more within the operating system, though. For
instance, calls to read a pipe will normally block the caller until
data becomes available (i.e., is sent by the program on the other
end), rather than returning an end-of-file indicator. Because of such
properties, pipes are also a way to synchronize the execution of
independent programs.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-3-SECT-6.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.6.1 Anonymous Pipe Basics</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-59"></A>Pipes
come in two flavors -- <span class="docEmphasis">anonymous</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">named</span>. Named pipes (sometimes called
"fifos") are represented by a file on your computer.
Anonymous pipes only exist within processes, though, and are
typically used in conjunction with process <span class="docEmphasis">forks</span>
as a way to link parent and spawned child processes within an
application -- parent and child converse over shared pipe file
descriptors. Because named pipes are really external files, the
communicating processes need not be related at all (in fact, they can
be independently started programs).
</P>

<P class="docText">Since they are more traditional, let's start with a look at
anonymous pipes. To illustrate, the script in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-15">Example 3-15</A> uses the <TT>os.fork</TT> call to
make a copy of the calling process as usual (we met forks earlier in
this chapter). After forking, the original parent process and its
child copy speak through the two ends of a pipe created with
<TT>os.pipe</TT> prior to the fork. The
<TT>os.pipe</TT> call returns a tuple of two <span class="docEmphasis">file
descriptors  --</span> the low-level file identifiers we met
earlier -- representing the input and output sides of the pipe.
Because forked child processes get <span class="docEmphasis">copies</span> of
their parents' file descriptors, writing to the pipe's
output descriptor in the child sends data back to the parent on the
pipe created before the child was spawned.

<P class="docText">If you run this program on Linux ( <TT>pipe</TT> is
available on Windows today, but <TT>fork</TT> is not), the
parent process waits for the child to send data on the pipe each time
it calls <TT>os.read</TT>. It's almost as if the
child and parent act as client and server here -- the parent
starts the child and waits for it to initiate
communication.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[7]</A></sup> Just to tease, the
child keeps the parent waiting one second longer between messages
with <TT>time.sleep</TT> calls, until the delay has reached
four seconds. When the <TT>zzz</TT> delay counter hits 005,
it rolls back down to 000 and starts again:

<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[7]</A></sup> We will clarify the notions of
"client" and "server" in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-10.html#python2-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>. There, we'll communicate with
<span class="docEmphasis">sockets</span> (which are very roughly like
bidirectional pipes for networks), but the overall conversation model
is similar. Named pipes (fifos), described later, are a better match
to the client/server model, because they can be accessed by
arbitrary, unrelated processes (no forks are required). But as
we'll see, the socket port model is generally used by most
Internet scripting protocols.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">If you look closely, you'll see that when the child's
delay counter hits 004, the parent ends up reading two messages from
the pipe <span class="docEmphasis">at once  --</span> the child wrote two
distinct messages, but they were close enough in time to be fetched
as a single unit by the parent. Really, the parent blindly asks to
read at most 32 bytes each time, but gets back whatever text is
available in the pipe (when it becomes available at all). To
distinguish messages better, we can mandate a separator character in
the pipe. An end-of-line makes this easy, because we can wrap the

these (e.g., <TT>os.fork</TT>), but much of this code

</UL>
<P class="docText">In terms of connecting standard streams, <TT>os.dup2</TT>
is the real nitty-gritty here. For example, the call
<TT>os.dup2(parentStdin,stdinFd)</TT> essentially assigns
the parent process's <TT>stdin</TT> file to the input
end of one of the two pipes created; all <TT>stdin</TT>
reads will henceforth come from the pipe. By connecting the other end
of this pipe to the child process's copy of the
<TT>stdout</TT> stream file with
<TT>os.dup2(childStdout,stdoutFd)</TT>, text written by the
child to its <TT>sdtdout</TT> winds up being routed through
the pipe to the parent's <TT>stdin</TT> stream.

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-3-336971"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-3-336972"></A>These
two processes engage in a simple dialog, but it's already
enough to illustrate some of the dangers lurking in cross-program
communications. First of all, notice that both programs need to write
to <TT>stderr</TT> to display a message -- their
<TT>stdout</TT> streams are tied to the other
program's input stream. Because processes share file
descriptors, <TT>stderr</TT> is the same in both parent and
child, so status messages show up in the same place.
</P>

<P class="docText">More subtly, note that both parent and child call
<TT>sys.stdout.flush</TT> after they print text to the
<TT>stdout</TT> stream. Input requests on pipes normally
block the caller if there is no data available, but it seems that
shouldn't be a problem in our example -- there are as many
writes as there are reads on the other side of the pipe. By default,
though, <TT>sys.stdout</TT> is
<span class="docEmphasis">buffered</span>, so the printed text may not actually
be transmitted until some time in the future (when the
<TT>stdio</TT> output buffers fill up). In fact, if the
flush calls are not made, both processes will get stuck waiting for
input from the other -- input that is sitting in a buffer and is
never flushed out over the pipe. They wind up in a
<span class="docEmphasis">deadlock</span> state, both blocked on
<TT>raw_input</TT> calls waiting for events that never
occur.
</P>

<P class="docText">Keep in mind that output buffering is really a function of the
filesystem used to access pipes, not pipes themselves (pipes do queue
up output data, but never hide it from readers!). In fact it only
occurs in this example because we copy the pipe's information
over to <TT>sys.stdout</TT> -- a built-in file object
that uses <TT>stdio</TT> buffering by default. However,
such anomalies can also occur when using other cross-process tools,
such as the <TT>popen2</TT> and <TT>popen3</TT>
calls introduced in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-2.html#python2-CHP-2">Chapter 2</A>.
</P>

<P class="docText">In general terms, if your programs engage in a two-way dialogs like
this, there are at least three ways to avoid buffer-related deadlock
problems:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">As demonstrated in this example, manually
<span class="docEmphasis">flushing</span> output pipe streams by calling file
<TT>flush</TT> method is an easy way to force buffers to be
cleared.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">It's possible to use pipes in <span class="docEmphasis">unbuffered mode
 --</span> either use low-level <TT>os</TT> module
calls to read and write pipe descriptors directly, or (on most
systems) pass a buffer size argument of
to <TT>os.fdopen</TT> to disable <TT>stdio</TT>
buffering in the file object used to wrap the descriptor. For fifos,
described in the next section, do the same for
<TT>open</TT>.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Simply use the <TT>-u</TT> Python command-line flag to turn
off buffering for the <TT>sys.stdout</TT> stream.

</UL>
<P class="docText">The last technique merits a few more words. Try this: delete all the
<TT>sys.stdout.flush</TT> calls in both Examples <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-17">Example 3-17</A> and <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-18">Example 3-18</A> (files
<I>pipes.py</I> and
<I>pipes-testchild.py</I>) and change the
parent's spawn call in <I>pipes.py</I> to this
(i.e., add a <TT>-u</TT> command-line argument):
</P>

<PRE>spawn('python', '-u', 'pipes-testchild.py', 'spam')</PRE>

<P class="docText">Then start the program with a command line like this:
<TT>python</TT> <TT>-u</TT>
<TT>pipes.py</TT>. It will work as it did with manual
<TT>stdout</TT> flush calls, because
<TT>stdout</TT> will be operating in
<span class="docEmphasis">unbuffered</span> mode. Deadlock in general, though, is
a bigger problem than we have space to address here; on the other
hand, if you know enough to want to do IPC in Python, you're
probably already a veteran of the deadlock wars.<A NAME="IXTR3-68"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.6.3 Named Pipes (Fifos)</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXTR3-69"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-3-336973"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-3-336974"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-3-336975"></A>On some
platforms, it is also possible to create a pipe that exists as a
file. Such files are called "named pipes" (or sometimes,
"fifos"), because they behave just like the pipes created
within the previous programs, but are associated with a real file
somewhere on your computer, external to any particular program. Once
a named pipe file is created, processes read and write it using
normal file operations. Fifos are unidirectional streams, but a set
of two fifos can be used to implement bidirectional communication
just as we did for anonymous pipes in the prior section.
</P>

<P class="docText">Because fifos are files, they are longer-lived than in-process pipes
and can be accessed by programs started independently. The unnamed,
in-process pipe examples thus far depend on the fact that file
descriptors (including pipes) are copied to child processes. With
fifos, pipes are accessed instead by a filename visible to all
programs regardless of any parent/child process relationships.
Because of that, they are better suited as IPC mechanisms for
independent client and server programs; for instance, a perpetually
running server program may create and listen for requests on a fifo,
that can be accessed later by arbitrary clients not forked by the
server.
</P>

<P class="docText">In Python, named pipe files are created with the
<TT>os.mkfifo</TT> call, available today on Unix-like
platforms and Windows NT (but not on Windows 95/98). This only
creates the external file, though; to send and receive data through a
fifo, it must be opened and processed as if it were a standard file.
<A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-19">Example 3-19</A> is a derivation of the
<I>pipe2.py</I> script listed earlier, written to use
fifos instead of anonymous pipes.

<P class="docText">Because the fifo exists independently of both parent and child,
there's no reason to fork here -- the child may be started
independently of the parent, as long as it opens a fifo file by the
same name. Here, for instance, on Linux the parent is started in one
xterm window, and then the child is started in another. Messages
start appearing in the parent window only after the child is started:
