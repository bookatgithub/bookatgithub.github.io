<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-68"></A>For
lack of a better analogy, signals are a way to poke a stick at a
process. Programs generate signals to trigger a
<span class="docEmphasis">handler</span> for that signal in another process. The
operating system pokes too -- some signals are generated on
unusual system events and may kill the program if not handled. If
this sounds a little like raising exceptions in Python it should;
signals are software-generated events, and the cross-process analog
of exceptions. Unlike exceptions, though, signals are identified by
number, are not stacked, and are really an <span class="docEmphasis">asynchronous
event</span> mechanism controlled by the operating system,
outside the scope of the Python interpreter.
</P>

<P class="docText">In order to make signals available to scripts, Python provides a
<TT>signal</TT> module that allows Python programs to
register Python functions as handlers for signal events. This module
is available on both Unix-like platforms and Windows (though the
Windows version defines fewer kinds of signals to be caught). To
illustrate the basic signal interface, the script in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-20">Example 3-20</A> installs a Python handler function for the
signal number passed in as a command-line argument.

<P class="docText">There are only two <TT>signal</TT> module calls at work
here:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList"><TT>signal.signal</TT> takes a signal number and function
object, and installs that function to handle that signal number when
it is raised. Python automatically restores most signal handlers when
signals occur, so there is no need to recall this function within the
signal handler itself to re-register the handler. That is, except for
<TT>SIGCHLD</TT>, a signal handler remains installed until
explicitly reset (e.g., by setting the handler to
<TT>SIG_DFL</TT> to restore default behavior, or to
<TT>SIG_IGN</TT> to ignore the signal).
<TT>SIGCHLD</TT> behavior is platform-specific.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><TT>signal.pause</TT> makes the process sleep until the
next signal is caught. A <TT>time.sleep</TT> call is
similar but doesn't work with signals on my Linux box -- it
generates an interrupted system call error. A busy
<TT>while</TT> <TT>1:</TT>
<TT>pass</TT> loop here would pause the script too, but may
squander CPU resources.

<P class="docText">Here is what this script looks like running on Linux: a signal number
to watch for (12) is passed in on the command line, and the program
is made to run in the background with a <TT>&amp;</TT>
shell operator (available in most Unix-like shells):

<P class="docText">Inputs and outputs are a bit jumbled here, because the process prints
to the same screen used to type new shell commands. To send the
program a signal, the <I>kill</I> shell command takes a
signal number and a process ID to be signalled (809); every time a
new <I>kill</I> command sends a signal, the process
replies with a message generated by a Python signal handler function.
</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>signal</TT> module also exports a
<TT>signal.alarm</TT> function for scheduling a
<TT>SIGALRM</TT> signal to occur at some number of seconds
in the future. To trigger and catch timeouts, set the alarm and
install a <TT>SIGALRM</TT> handler as in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-21">Example 3-21</A>.

<P class="docText">Generally speaking, signals must be used with cautions not made
obvious by the examples we've just seen. For instance, some
system calls don't react well to being interrupted by signals,
and only the main thread can install signal handlers and respond to
signals in a multithreaded program.
</P>

<P class="docText">When used well, though, signals provide an event-based communication
mechanism. They are less powerful than data streams like pipes, but
are sufficient in situations where you just need to tell a program
that something important has occurred at all, and not pass along any
details about the event itself. Signals are sometimes also combined
with other IPC tools. For example, an initial signal may inform a
program that a client wishes to communicate over a named
pipe -- the equivalent of tapping someone's shoulder to get
their attention before speaking. Most platforms reserve one or more
<TT>SIGUSR</TT> signal numbers for user-defined events of
this sort.<A NAME="IXTR3-71"></A>
