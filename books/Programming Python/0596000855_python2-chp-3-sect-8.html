<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-3-336976"></A>Suppose just for a moment, that you've
been asked to write a big Python book, and want to provide a way for
readers to easily start the book's examples on just about any
platform that Python runs on. Books are nice, but it's awfully
fun to be able to click on demos right away. That is, you want to
write a general and portable launcher program in Python, for starting
other Python programs. What to do?
</P>

<P class="docText">In this chapter, we've seen how to portably spawn threads, but
these are simply parallel functions, not external programs.
We've also learned how to go about starting new, independently
running programs, with both the
<TT>fork</TT>/<TT>exec</TT> combination, and
tools for launching shell commands such as
<TT>os.popen</TT>. Along the way, though, I've also
been careful to point out numerous times that the
<TT>os.fork</TT> call doesn't work on Windows today,
and <TT>os.popen</TT> fails in Python release 1.5.2 and
earlier when called from a GUI program on Windows; either of these
constraints may be improved by the time you read this book (e.g., 2.0
improves <TT>os.popen</TT> on Windows), but they
weren't quite there yet as I wrote this chapter. Moreover, for
reasons we'll explore later, the <TT>os.popen</TT>
call is prone to blocking (pausing) its caller in some scenarios.
</P>

<P class="docText">Luckily, there are other ways to start programs in the Python
standard library, albeit in platform-specific fashion:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">The <TT>os.spawnv</TT> and <TT>os.spawnve</TT>
calls launch programs on Windows, much like a
<TT>fork</TT>/<TT>exec</TT> call combination on
Unix-like platforms.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">The <TT>os.system</TT> call can be used on Windows to
launch a DOS <I>start</I> command, which opens (i.e.,
runs) a file independently based on its Windows filename
associations, as though it were clicked.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Tools in the Python <TT>win32all</TT> extensions package
provide other, less standardized ways to start programs (e.g., the
<TT>WinExec</TT> call).

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.8.1 The os.spawnv Call</H4>

<P class="docText">Of these, the <TT>spawnv</TT> call is the most complex, but
also the most like forking programs in Unix. It doesn't
actually copy the calling process (so shared descriptor operations
won't work), but can be used to start a Windows program running
completely independent of the calling program. The script in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-22">Example 3-22</A> makes the similarity more obvious -- it
launches a program with a
<TT>fork</TT>/<TT>exec</TT> combination in Linux,
or an <TT>os.spawnv</TT> call on Windows.

<P class="docText">Notice that the copies print their output in random order, and the
parent program exits before all children do; all these programs are
really running in parallel on Windows. Also observe that the child
program's output shows up in the console box where
<I>spawnv.py</I> was run; when using
<TT>P_NOWAIT</TT> standard output comes to the
parent's console, but seems to go nowhere when using
<TT>P_DETACH</TT> instead (most likely a feature, when
spawning GUI programs).
</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>os.spawnve</TT> call works the same as
<TT>os.spawnv</TT>, but accepts an extra fourth dictionary
argument to specify a different shell environment for the spawned
program (which, by default, inherits all the parent's
settings).

<H4 class="docSection2Title">3.8.2 Running DOS Command Lines</H4>

<P class="docText">The <TT>os.system</TT> and <TT>os.popen</TT>
calls can be used to start command lines on Windows just as on
Unix-like platforms (but with the portability caveats about
<TT>popen</TT> mentioned earlier). On Windows, though, the
DOS <I>start</I> command combined with
<TT>os.system</TT> provides an easy way for scripts to
launch any file on the system, using Windows filename associations.
Starting a program file this way makes it run as independently as its
starter. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-EX-23">Example 3-23</A> demonstrates these launch
techniques.

<P class="docText">Uncomment one of the lines in this script's

printed by five spawned Python programs:

<P class="docText">The <TT>os.system</TT> call usually blocks its caller until
the spawned program exits; reading the output of a
<TT>os.popen</TT> call has the same blocking effect (the
reader waits for the spawned program's output to be complete).
But with either of the last two statements in the loop uncommented, I
get output that simply looks like this:
</P>

Main process exiting.</PRE>

<P class="docText">In both cases, I also see five new and completely independent DOS

is uncommented, all the DOS boxes go away right after they appear;
when the last line in the loop is active, they remain on the screen
after the <TT>dosstart</TT> program exits because the
<TT>child-wait</TT> script pauses for input before exit.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-3-SECT-8.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">3.8.2.1 Using the DOS start command</H5>

<P class="docText">To understand why, you first need to know how the DOS
<I>start</I> command works in general. Roughly, a DOS
command line of the form <TT>start</TT>
<TT><I>command</I></TT> works as if
<TT><I>command</I></TT> were typed in the Windows
"Run" dialog box available in the Start button menu. If
<TT><I>command</I></TT> is a filename, it is opened
exactly as if its name had been double-clicked in the Windows
Explorer file selector GUI.
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, the following three DOS commands automatically start
Internet Explorer on a file <I>index.html</I>, my
registered image viewer program on a <I>uk-1.jpg</I>,
and my sound media player program on file
<I>sousa.au</I>. Windows simply opens the file with
whatever program is associated to handle filenames of that form.
Moreover, all three of these programs run independently of the DOS
console box where the command is typed:
</P>

<PRE>C:\temp&gt;<B>start c:\stuff\website\public_html\index.html</B>
C:\temp&gt;<B>start c:\stuff\website\public_html\uk-1.jpg</B>
C:\...\PP2E\System\Processes&gt;<B>start ..\..\Internet\Ftp\sousa.au</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Now, because the <I>start</I> command can run any file
and command line, there is no reason it cannot also be used to start
an independently running Python program:
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\System\Processes&gt;<B>start child.py 1</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">Because Python is registered to open names ending in
<I>.py</I> when it is installed, this really does
work -- script <I>child.py</I> is launched
independently of the DOS console window, even though we didn't
provide the name or path of the Python interpreter program. Because
<I>child.py</I> simply prints a message and exits,
though, the result isn't exactly satisfying: a new DOS window
pops up to serve as the script's standard output, and
immediately goes away when the child exits (it's that Windows
"flash feature" described earlier!). To do better, add a
<TT>raw_input</TT> call at the bottom of the program file
to wait for a key press before exiting:
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\System\Processes&gt;<B>type child-wait.py</B>
import os, sys
print 'Hello from child', os.getpid(  ), sys.argv[1]
raw_input("Press &lt;Enter&gt;")   # don't flash on Windows

C:\...\PP2E\System\Processes&gt;<B>start child-wait.py 2</B> </PRE>

<P class="docText">Now the child's DOS window pops up and stays up after the
<I>start</I> command has returned. Pressing the Enter key
in the pop-up DOS window makes it go away.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-3-SECT-8.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">3.8.2.2 Using start in Python scripts</H5>

<P class="docText">Since we know that Python's <TT>os.system</TT> and
<TT>os.popen</TT> can be called by a script to run
<span class="docEmphasis">any</span> command line that can be typed at a DOS
shell prompt, we can also start independently running programs from a
Python script by simply running a DOS <I>start</I>
command line. For instance:
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E&gt;<B>python</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>import os</B>

0

0</PRE>

<P class="docText">The four Python <TT>os.system</TT> calls here start
whatever web-page browser, image viewer, and sound player are
registered on your machine to open <I>.html</I>,
<I>.gif</I>, and <I>.au </I>files (unless
these programs are already running). The launched programs run
completely independent of the Python session -- when running a DOS
start command, <TT>os.system</TT> does not wait for the
spawned program to exit. For instance, <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-FIG-1">Figure 3-1</A>

<P class="docText">Now, since we also know that a Python program be can started from a

0</PRE>

<P class="docText">When running a <TT>python</TT> command, the
<TT>os.system</TT> call waits (blocks) for the command to
finish. When running a <I>start</I> command it does
not -- the launched Python program (here, PyEdit, a text editor
GUI we'll meet in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-9.html#python2-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>) runs
independent of the <TT>os.system</TT> caller. And finally,
that's why the following call in
<I>dosstart.py</I> generates a new, independent
instance of <I>child-wait.py </I>:
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\System\Processes&gt;<B>python</B>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.system('start child-wait.py 1')</B>
0</PRE>

<P class="docText">When run, this call pops up a new, independent DOS console window to
serve as the standard input and output streams of the child-wait
program. It truly is independent -- in fact, it keeps running if
we exit both this Python interpreter session and the DOS console box
where the command was typed.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[9]</A></sup> An <TT>os.popen</TT> call can
launch a <I>start</I> command too; but since it normally
starts commands independently anyhow, the only obvious advantages of
<I>start</I> here are the pop-up DOS box, and the fact
that Python need not be in the system search path setting:
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[9]</A></sup> And remember, if you
want to start a Python GUI program this way and not see the new DOS
standard stream console box at all, simply name the script
<I>child-wait.pyw </I>; the "w" on the end
tells the Windows Python port to avoid the DOS box. For DOS jockeys:
the <I>start</I> command also allows a few interesting
options: <TT>/m</TT> (run minimized),
<TT>/max</TT> (run maximized), <TT>/r</TT> (run
restored -- the default), and <TT>/w</TT> (don't
return until the other program exits -- this adds caller blocking
if you need it). Type <TT>start</TT> <TT>/?</TT>
for help. And for any Unix developers peeking over the fence: you can
also launch independent programs with
<TT>os.system</TT> -- append the
<TT>&amp;</TT> background operator to the command
line.</p></blockquote>

'Hello from child -413849 1\012Press &lt;Enter&gt;'</PRE>

<P class="docText">Which scheme to use, then? Using <TT>os.system</TT> or
<TT>os.popen</TT> to run a <TT>python</TT>
command works fine, but only if your users have added the
<I>python.exe</I> directory to their system search path
setting. Running a DOS <I>start</I> command is often a
simpler alternative to both running <TT>python</TT>
commands and calling the <TT>os.spawnv</TT> function, since
filename associations are automatically installed along with Python,
and <TT>os.spawnv</TT> requires a full directory path to
the Python interpreter program (<I>python.exe</I>). On
the other hand, running <I>start</I> commands with
<TT>os.system</TT> calls can fail on Windows for very long
command-line strings:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.system('start child-wait.py ' + 'Z'*425)   </B># okay- 425 Zs in dos popup
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.system('start child-wait.py ' + 'Z'*450)</B>   # fails- msg, not exception
Access is denied.
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.popen('python child-wait.py ' + 'Z'*500).read(  )    </B># works if PATH set
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.system('python child-wait.py ' + 'Z'*500)</B>          # works if PATH set

&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>pypath = r'C:\program files\python\python.exe'</B>        # this works too
&gt;&gt;&gt; <B>os.spawnv(os.P_NOWAIT, pypath, ('python', 'child-wait.py', 'Z'*500))</B></PRE>

<P class="docText">As a rule of thumb, use <TT>os.spawnv</TT> if your commands
are (or may be) long. For instance, we'll meet a script in
<A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-4.html#python2-CHP-4">Chapter 4</A>, that launches web browsers to view HTML
files; even though a <I>start</I> command applied to an
HTML file will automatically start a browser program, this script
instead must use <TT>os.spawnv</TT> to accommodate
potentially long directory paths in HTML filenames.

<P class="docText">For more information on other Windows-specific program launcher
tools, see O'Reilly's <span class="docEmphasis">Python Programming on

<P class="docText">With all these different ways to start programs on different
platforms, it can be difficult to remember what tools to use in a
given situation. Moreover, some of these tools are called in ways
that are complicated enough to easily forget (for me, at least). I

eventually wrote a module to try and hide most of the underlying

<P class="docText">Near the end of the file, the module picks a default class based on
the <TT>sys.platform</TT> attribute:
<TT>PortableLauncher</TT> is set to a class that uses
<TT>spawnv</TT> on Windows and one that uses the
<TT>fork</TT>/<TT>exec</TT> combination
elsewhere. If you import this module and always use its
<TT>PortableLauncher</TT> attribute, you can forget many of
the platform-specific details enumerated in this chapter.
</P>

<P class="docText">To run a Python program, simply import the
<TT>PortableLauncher</TT> class, make an instance by
passing a label and command line (without a leading
"python" word), and then call the instance object as
though it were a function. The program is started by a
<span class="docEmphasis">call</span> operation instead of a method, so that the
classes in this module can be used to generate <span class="docEmphasis">callback
handlers</span> in Tkinter-based GUIs. As we'll see in the
upcoming chapters, button-presses in Tkinter invoke a callable-object
with no arguments; by registering a
<TT>PortableLauncher</TT> instance to handle the press
event, we can automatically start a new program from another
program's GUI.
</P>

<P class="docText">When run standalone, this module's <TT>selftest</TT>
function is invoked as usual. On both Windows and Linux, all classes
tested start a new Python text editor program (the upcoming PyEdit
GUI program again) running independently with its own window. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-3-FIG-2">Figure 3-2</A> shows one in action on Windows; all spawned
editors open the <I>launchmodes.py</I> source file
automatically, because its name is passed to PyEdit as a command-line
argument. As coded, both <TT>System</TT> and
<TT>Popen</TT> block the caller until the editor exits, but
<TT>PortableLauncher</TT> (really, <TT>Spawn</TT>
or <TT>Fork</TT>) and <TT>Start</TT> do
not:<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[10]</A></sup>
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[10]</A></sup> This is fairly subtle. Technically,
<TT>Popen</TT> only blocks its caller because the input
pipe to the spawned program is closed too early, when the
<TT>os.popen</TT> call's result is garbage-collected
in <TT>Popen.run</TT>; <TT>os.popen</TT> normally
does not block (in fact, assigning its result here to a global
variable postpones blocking, but only until the next
<TT>Popen</TT> object run frees the prior result). On
Linux, adding a <TT>&amp;</TT> to the end of the
constructed command line in the <TT>System</TT> and
<TT>Popen.run</TT> methods makes these objects no longer
block their callers when run. Since the
<TT>fork</TT>/<TT>exec</TT>,
<TT>spawnv</TT>, and
<TT>system</TT>/<TT>start</TT> schemes seem at
least as good in practice, these <TT>Popen</TT> block
states have not been addressed. Note too that the
<TT>Start</TT> scheme does not generate a DOS console
pop-up window in the self-test, only because the text editor program
file's name ends in a <I>.pyw</I> extension;
starting <I>.py</I> program files with
<TT>os.system</TT> normally creates the console pop-up
box.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">As a more practical application, this file is also used by launcher
scripts designed to run examples in this book in a portable fashion.
The PyDemos and PyGadgets scripts at the top of this book's
examples directory tree (view CD-ROM content online at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>) simply import
<TT>PortableLauncher</TT>, and register instances to
respond to GUI events. Because of that, these two launcher GUIs run
on both Windows and Linux unchanged (Tkinter's portability
helps too, of course). The PyGadgets script even customizes
<TT>PortableLauncher</TT> to update a label in a GUI at
start time:
</P>

<PRE>class Launcher(launchmodes.PortableLauncher):    # use wrapped launcher class
    def announce(self, text):                    # customize to set GUI label
        Info.config(text=text)</PRE>

<P class="docText">We'll explore these scripts in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-PART-II.html#python2-PART-II">Part II</A>
(but feel free to peek at the end of <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-8.html#python2-CHP-8">Chapter 8</A>,
now). Because of this role, the <TT>Spawn</TT> class in
this file uses additional tools to search for the Python
executable's path -- required by
<TT>os.spawnv</TT>. It calls two functions exported by a
file <I>Launcher.py</I> to find a suitable
<I>python.exe</I>, whether or not the user has added
its directory to their system PATH variable's setting. The idea
is to start Python programs, even if Python hasn't been
installed in the shell variables on the local machine. Because
we're going to meet <I>Launcher.py</I> in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-4.html#python2-CHP-4">Chapter 4</A>, though, I'm going to postpone further
details for now.
