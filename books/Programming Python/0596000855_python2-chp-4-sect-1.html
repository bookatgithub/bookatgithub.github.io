<P class="docText">This chapter and the next continue our look at the <span class="docEmphasis">system
utilities</span> domain in Python. They present a collection of
larger Python scripts that do real systems work -- comparing and
copying directory trees, splitting files, searching files and
directories, testing other programs, configuring program shell
environments, launching web browsers, and so on. To make this
collection easier to absorb, it's been split into a two-chapter
set. This chapter presents assorted Python system utility programs
that illustrate typical tasks and techniques in this domain. The next
chapter presents larger Python programs that focus on more advanced
file and directory tree processing.
</P>

<P class="docText">Although the main point of these two case-study chapters is to give
you a feel for realistic scripts in action, the size of these
examples also gives us an opportunity to see Python's support
for development paradigms like OOP and reuse at work. It's
really only in the context of nontrivial programs like the ones
we'll meet here that such tools begin to bear tangible fruit.
These chapters also emphasize the "why" of systems tools,
not just the "how" -- along the way, I'll point
out real-world needs met by the examples we'll study, to help
you put the details in context.
</P>

<P class="docText">One note up front: these chapters move quickly, and a few of their
examples are largely just listed for independent study. Because all
the scripts here are all heavily documented and use Python system
tools described in the prior two chapters, I won't go through
all code in detail. You should read the source code listings and
experiment with these programs on your own computer, to get a better
feel for how to combine system interfaces to accomplish realistic
tasks. They are all available in source code form on the book's
CD-ROM (view CD-ROM content online at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>), and most work on all major platforms.
</P>

<P class="docText">I should also mention that these are programs I really <span class="docEmphasis">use
 --</span> not examples written just for this book. In fact,
they were coded over years and perform widely differing tasks, so
there is no obvious common thread to connect the dots here. On the
other hand, they help explain why system tools are useful in the
first place, demonstrate larger development concepts that simpler
examples cannot, and bear collective witness to the simplicity and
portability of automating system tasks with Python. Once you've
mastered the basics, you'll probably wish you had done so
sooner.
