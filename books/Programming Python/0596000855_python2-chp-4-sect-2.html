<H3 class="docSection1Title">4.2 Splitting and Joining Files</H3>

<P class="docText">Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I
can tell, it's the thing to do these days. Among this latest
generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same
sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear
into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on
computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It's probably healthier
than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but
that's a topic for another kind of book.
</P>

<P class="docText">But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does,
you probably know that it's not a bad idea to keep tabs on what
those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in
almost any web search engine and you'll understand the
concern -- it's much better stuff than I could get during my
teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in
my house have Internet feeds.
</P>

<P class="docText">Now, while they're on one of these machines, my kids download
lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with
viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to
download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them
to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are
not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and
burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).
</P>

<P class="docText">If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue.
There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file
into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy
(<I>split</I>), and others for putting the pieces back
together to recreate the original file (<I>cat</I>).
Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though,
we needed a more portable solution.

Python script came to the rescue. The Python program in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-4-EX-1">Example 4-1</A> distributes a single file's contents
among a set of part files, and stores those part files in a

files given by the <I>ls</I> command, you'll come
up with 5,028,339 bytes -- exactly the same as the original
file's size. Before we see how to put these files back together
again, let's explore a few of the splitter script's finer
points.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-4-SECT-2.1.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.2.1.1 Operation modes</H5>

<P class="docText">This script is designed to input its parameters in either
<span class="docEmphasis">interactive</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">command-line</span>
modes; it checks the number of command-line arguments to know in
which mode it is being used. In command-line mode, you list the file
to be split and the output directory on the command line, and can
optionally override the default part file size with a third
command-line argument.
</P>

<P class="docText">In interactive mode, the script asks for a filename and output
directory at the console window with <TT>raw_input</TT>,
and pauses for a keypress at the end before exiting. This mode is
nice when the program file is started by clicking on its
icon -- on Windows, parameters are typed into a pop-up DOS box
that doesn't automatically disappear. The script also shows the
absolute paths of its parameters (by running them through
<TT>os.path.abspath</TT>) because they may not be obvious
in interactive mode. We'll see examples of other split modes at
work in a moment.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-4-SECT-2.1.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.2.1.2 Binary file access</H5>

<P class="docText">This code is careful to open both input and output files in binary
mode (<TT>rb</TT>, <TT>wb</TT>), because it needs
to portably handle things like executables and audio files, not just
text. In <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-2.html#python2-CHP-2">Chapter 2</A>, we learned that on Windows,
text-mode files automatically map <TT>\r\n</TT> end-of-line
sequences to <TT>\n</TT> on input, and map
<TT>\n</TT> to <TT>\r\n</TT> on output. For true
binary data, we really don't want any <TT>\r</TT>
characters in the data to go away when read, and we don't want
any superfluous <TT>\r</TT> characters to be added on
output. Binary-mode files suppress this <TT>\r</TT> mapping
when the script is run on Windows, and so avoid data corruption.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-4-SECT-2.1.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.2.1.3 Manually closing files</H5>

<P class="docText">This script also goes out of its way to manually close its files. For
instance:
</P>

<PRE> fileobj  = open(partname, 'wb')
 fileobj.write(chunk)
 fileobj.close(  )</PRE>

<P class="docText">As we also saw in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-2.html#python2-CHP-2">Chapter 2</A>, these three lines can
usually be replaced with this single line:
</P>

<PRE>open(partname, 'wb').write(chunk)</PRE>

<P class="docText">This shorter form relies on the fact that the current Python
implementation automatically closes files for you when file objects
are reclaimed (i.e., when they are garbage collected, because there
are no more references to the file object). In this line, the file
object would be reclaimed immediately, because the
<TT>open</TT> result is temporary in an expression, and is
never referenced by a longer-lived name. The <TT>input</TT>
file similarly is reclaimed when the <TT>split</TT>
function exits.
</P>

<P class="docText">As I was writing this chapter, though, there was some possibility
that this automatic-close behavior may go away in the
future.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[1]</A></sup>
Moreover, the JPython Java-based Python implementation does not
reclaim unreferenced objects as immediately as the standard Python.
If you care about the Java port (or one possible future), your script
may potentially create many files in a short amount of time, and your
script may run on a machine that has a limit on the number of open
files per program, then close manually. The <TT>close</TT>
calls in this script have never been necessary for my purposes, but
because the <TT>split</TT> function in this module is
intended to be a general-purpose tool, it accommodates such
worst-case scenarios.
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[1]</A></sup> I hope this doesn't happen -- such a
change would be a major break from backward compatibility, and could
impact Python systems all over the world. On the other hand,
it's just a possibility for a future mutation of Python.
I'm told that publishers of technical books love language
changes, and this isn't a text on politics.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Some of this process is still manual, of course (I haven't
quite figured out how to script the "walk the floppies

<TT>join</TT> scripts make it both quick and simple to move
big files around. Because this script is also portable Python code,
it runs on any platform we care to move split files to. For instance,
it's typical for my kids to download both Windows and Linux
games; since this script runs on either platform, they're
covered.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-4-SECT-2.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.2.2.1 Reading by blocks or files</H5>

<P class="docText">Before we move on, there are a couple of details worth underscoring
in the join script's code. First of all, notice that this
script deals with files in binary mode, but also reads each part file
in blocks of 1K bytes each. In fact, the <TT>readsize</TT>
setting here (the size of each block read from an input part file)
has no relation to <TT>chunksize</TT> in
<I>split.py</I> (the total size of each output part
file). As we learned in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-2.html#python2-CHP-2">Chapter 2</A>, this script
could instead read each part file all at once:
</P>

<PRE>filebytes = open(filepath, 'rb').read(  )
output.write(filebytes)</PRE>

<P class="docText">The downside to this scheme is that it really does load all of a file
into memory at once. For example, reading a 1.4M part file into
memory all at once with the file object <TT>read</TT>
method generates a 1.4M string in memory to hold the file's
bytes. Since <TT>split</TT> allows users to specify even
larger chunk sizes, the <TT>join</TT> script plans for the
worst and reads in terms of limited-size blocks. To be completely
robust, the <TT>split</TT> script could read its input data
in smaller chunks too, but this hasn't become a concern in
practice.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-4-SECT-2.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">4.2.2.2 Sorting filenames</H5>

<P class="docText">If you study this script's code closely, you may also notice
that the join scheme it uses relies completely on the sort order of
filenames in the parts directory. Because it simply calls the list
<TT>sort</TT> method on the filenames list returned by
<TT>os.listdir</TT>, it implicitly requires that filenames
have the same length and format when created by split. The splitter
uses zero-padding notation in a string formatting expression
(<TT>'part%04d'</TT>) to make sure that filenames all have
the same number of digits at the end (four), much like this list:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; list = ['xx008', 'xx010', 'xx006', 'xx009', 'xx011', 'xx111']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list.sort(  )
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
['xx006', 'xx008', 'xx009', 'xx010', 'xx011', 'xx111']</PRE>

<P class="docText">When sorted, the leading zero characters in small numbers guarantee
that part files are ordered for joining correctly. Without the
leading zeroes, <TT>join</TT> would fail whenever there
were more than nine part files, because the first digit would
dominate:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; list = ['xx8', 'xx10', 'xx6', 'xx9', 'xx11', 'xx111']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list.sort(  )
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
['xx10', 'xx11', 'xx111', 'xx6', 'xx8', 'xx9']</PRE>

<P class="docText">Because the list <TT>sort</TT> method accepts a comparison
function as an argument, we could in principle strip off digits in
filenames and sort numerically:
</P>

<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; list = ['xx8', 'xx10', 'xx6', 'xx9', 'xx11', 'xx111']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list.sort(lambda x, y: cmp(int(x[2:]), int(y[2:])))
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
['xx6', 'xx8', 'xx9', 'xx10', 'xx11', 'xx111']</PRE>

<P class="docText">But that still implies that filenames all must start with the same
length substring, so this doesn't quite remove the file naming
dependency between the <TT>split</TT> and
<TT>join</TT> scripts. Because these scripts are designed
to be two steps of the same process, though, some dependencies
between them seem reasonable.

<P class="docText">When these program files are double-clicked in a file explorer GUI,
they work the same way (there usually are no command-line arguments
when launched this way). In this mode, absolute path displays help
clarify where files are really at. Remember, the current working
directory is the script's home directory when clicked like
this, so the name <I>tempsplit</I> actually maps to a
source code directory; type a full path to make the split files show
up somewhere else:

<P class="docText">A word about performance: All the <TT>split</TT> and
<TT>join</TT> tests shown so far process a 5M file, but
take at most one second of real wall-clock time to finish on my Win-
dows 98 300 and 650 MHz laptop computers -- plenty fast for just
about any use I could imagine. (They run even faster after Windows
has cached information about the files involved.) Both scripts run
just as fast for other reasonable part file sizes too; here is the
splitter chopping up the file into 500,000- and 50,000-byte parts:

<P class="docText">Split can take longer to finish, but only if the part file's
size is set small enough to generate thousands of part

respectively, depending on what other programs are open):

<P class="docText">Finally, the splitter is also smart enough to create the output
directory if it doesn't yet exist, or clear out any old files
there if it does exist. Because the joiner combines whatever files
exist in the output directory, this is a nice ergonomic
touch -- if the output directory was not cleared before each
split, it would be too easy to forget that a prior run's files
are still there. Given that my kids are running these scripts, they
need to be as forgiving as possible; your user base may vary, but
probably not by much.
