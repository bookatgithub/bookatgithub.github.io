<P class="docText">As we've seen, <A NAME="IXT-4-336977"></A>Python provides interfaces to a variety
of system services, along with tools for adding others. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-4-EX-5">Example 4-5</A> shows some commonly used services in action.
It implements a simple <span class="docEmphasis">regression-test</span> system,
by running a command-line program with a set of given input files and
comparing the output of each run to the prior run's results.
This script was adapted from an automated testing system I wrote to
catch errors introduced by changes in program source files; in a big
system, you might not know when a fix is really a bug in disguise.

<P class="docText">Some of this script is Unix-biased. For instance, the
<TT>2&gt;&amp;1</TT> syntax to redirect
<TT>stderr</TT> works on Unix and Windows NT/2000, but not
on Windows 9x, and the <I>diff</I> command line spawned
is a Unix utility. You'll need to tweak such code a bit to run
this script on some platforms. Also, given the improvements to the
<TT>os</TT> module's <TT>popen</TT> calls
in Python 2.0, they have now become a more portable way to redirect
streams in such a script, and an alternative to shell command
redirection syntax.
</P>

<P class="docText">But this script's basic operation is straightforward: for each
filename with an <I>.in</I> suffix in the test
directory, this script runs the program named on the command line and
looks for deviations in its results. This is an easy way to spot
changes (called "regressions") in the behavior of
programs spawned from the shell. The real secret of this
script's success is in the filenames used to record test
information: within a given test directory <I>testdir
</I>:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList"><TT>testdir/</TT><TT><I>test</I></TT><TT>.in</TT>
files represent standard input sources for program runs.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><TT>testdir/</TT><TT><I>test</I></TT><TT>.in.out</TT>
files represent the output generated for each input file.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><TT>testdir/</TT><TT><I>test</I></TT><TT>.in.out.bkp</TT>
files are backups of prior <I>.in.out</I> result files.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><TT>testdir/</TT><TT><I>test</I></TT><TT>.in.diffs</TT>
files represent regressions; output file differences.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Output and difference files are generated in the test directory, with
distinct suffixes. For example, if we have an executable program or
script called <TT>shrubbery</TT>, and a test directory
called <I>test1</I> containing a set of
<I>.in</I> input files, a typical run of the tester
might look something like this:
</P>

<PRE>% <B>regtest.py shrubbery test1</B>
RegTest start.
user: mark
path: /home/mark/stuff/python/testing
time: Mon Feb 26 21:13:20 1996

FAILED: test1/t1.in (see test1/t1.in.diffs)
PASSED: test1/t2.in
FAILED: test1/t3.in (see test1/t3.in.diffs)
RegTest done: Mon Feb 26 21:13:27 1996</PRE>

<P class="docText">Here, <TT>shrubbery</TT> is run three times, for the three
<I>.in</I> canned input files, and the results of each
run are compared to output generated for these three inputs the last
time testing was conducted. Such a Python script might be launched
once a day, to automatically spot deviations caused by recent source
code changes (e.g., from a <TT>cron</TT> job on Unix).
</P>

<P class="docText">We've already met system interfaces used by this script; most
are fairly standard Unix calls, and not very Python-specific to speak
of. In fact, much of what happens when we run this script occurs in
programs spawned by <TT>os.system</TT> calls. This script
is really just a <span class="docEmphasis">driver</span> ; because it is
completely independent of both the program to be tested and the
inputs it will read, we can add new test cases on the fly by dropping
a new input file in a test directory.
</P>

<P class="docText">So given that this script just drives other programs with standard
Unix-like calls, why use Python here instead of something like C ?
First of all, the equivalent program in C would be much longer: it
would need to declare variables, handle data structures, and more. In
C, all external services exist in a single global scope (the
linker's scope); in Python, they are partitioned into module
namespaces (<TT>os</TT>, <TT>sys</TT>, etc.) to
avoid name clashes. And unlike C, the Python code can be run
immediately, without compiling and linking; changes can be tested
much quicker in Python. Moreover, with just a little extra work we
could make this script run on Windows 9x too. As you can probably
tell by now, Python excels when it comes to portability and
productivity.
</P>

<P class="docText">Because of such benefits, automated testing is a very common role for
Python scripts. If you are interested in using Python for testing, be
sure to see Python's web site (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A>) for other available
tools (e.g., the PyUnit system).

<P class="docText">Once we learn about sending email from Python scripts in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-11.html#python2-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A>, you might also want to augment this script to
automatically send out email when regularly run tests fail. That way,
you don't even need to remember to check results. Of course,
you could go further still.
</P>

<P class="docText">One company I worked at added sound effects to compiler test scripts;
you got an audible round of applause if no regressions were found,
and an entirely different noise otherwise. (See the end of this
chapter and <I>playfile.py</I> in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-11.html#python2-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A> for audio hints.)
</P>

<P class="docText">Another company in my development past ran a nightly test script that
automatically isolated the source code file check-in that triggered a
test regression, and sent a nasty email to the guilty party (and
their supervisor). Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
