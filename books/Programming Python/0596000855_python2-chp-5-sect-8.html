<H3 class="docSection1Title">5.8 Comparing Directory Trees</H3>

<P class="docText">Engineers can be a paranoid sort (but you didn't hear that from
me). At least I am. It comes from decades of seeing things go
terribly wrong, I suppose. When I create a CD backup of my hard
drive, for instance, there's still something a bit too magical
about the process to trust the CD writer program to do the right
thing. Maybe I should, but it's tough to have a lot of faith in
tools that occasionally trash files, and seem to crash my Windows 98
machine every third Tuesday of the month. When push comes to shove,
it's nice to be able to verify that data copied to a backup CD
is the same as the original -- or at least spot deviations from
the original -- as soon as possible. If a backup is ever needed,
it will be <span class="docEmphasis">really</span> needed.
</P>

<P class="docText">Because data CDs are accessible as simple directory trees, we are
once again in the realm of tree walkers -- to verify a backup CD,
we simply need to walk its top-level directory. We've already
written a generic walker class (the <TT>visitor</TT>
module), but it won't help us here directly: we need to walk
<span class="docEmphasis">two</span> directories in parallel and inspect common
files along the way. Moreover, walking either one of the two
directories won't allow us to spot files and directories that
only exist in the other. Something more custom seems in order here.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-5-SECT-8.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.8.1 Finding Directory Differences</H4>

<P class="docText">Before we start coding, the first thing we need to clarify is what it
means to compare two directory trees. If both trees have exactly the
same branch structure and depth, this problem reduces to comparing
corresponding files in each tree. In general, though, the trees can
have arbitrarily different shapes, depth, and so on.
</P>

<P class="docText">More generally, the contents of a directory in one tree may have more
or fewer entries than the corresponding directory in the other tree.
If those differing contents are filenames, there is no corresponding
file to compare; if they are directory names, there is no
corresponding branch to descend through. In fact, the only way to
detect files and directories that appear in one tree but not the
other is to detect differences in each level's directory.
</P>

<P class="docText">In other words, a tree comparison algorithm will also have to perform
<span class="docEmphasis">directory</span> comparisons along the way. Because
this is a nested, and simpler operation, let's start by coding
a single-directory comparison of filenames in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-5-EX-24">Example 5-24</A>.

<TT>diffall</TT> radar. This global comparison can take a
few minutes -- it performs byte-for-byte comparisons of all
chapter files and screen shots, the examples tree, an image of the
book's CD, and more, but it's an accurate and complete
verification. Given that this book tree contained roughly 119M of
data in 7300 files and 570 directories the last time I checked, a
more manual verification procedure without Python's help would
be utterly impossible.
</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, it's worth noting that this script still only
<span class="docEmphasis">detects</span> differences in the tree, but does not
give any further details about individual file differences. In fact,
it simply loads and compares the binary contents of corresponding
files with a single string comparison -- it's a simple
yes/no result.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[11]</A></sup> If and when I need
more details about how two reported files actually differ, I either
edit the files, or run the file-comparison command on the host
platform (e.g., <I>fc</I> on Windows/DOS,
<I>diff</I> or <I>cmp</I> on Unix and Linux).
That's not a portable solution for this last step; but for my
purposes, just finding the differences in a 1300-file tree was much
more critical than reporting which lines differ in files flagged in
the report.
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[11]</A></sup> We might try to do a bit better here,
by opening text files in text mode to ignore line-terminator
differences, but it's not clear that such differences should be
blindly ignored (what if the caller wants to know if line-end markers
have been changed?). We could also be smarter by avoiding the load
and compare steps for files that differ in size, and read files in
small chunks, instead of all at once, to minimize memory requirements
for huge files (see earlier examples such as the
<TT>cpall</TT> script for hints). For my comparisons, such
optimizations are unnecessary.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Of course, since we can always run shell commands in Python, this
last step could be automated by spawning a <I>diff</I> or
<I>fc</I> command with <TT>os.popen</TT> as
differences are encountered (or after the traversal, by scanning the
report summary). Because Python excels at processing files and
strings, though, it's possible to go one step further and code
a Python equivalent of the <I>fc</I> and
<I>diff</I> commands. Since this is beyond both this
script's scope and this chapter's size limits, that will
have to await the attention of a curious reader.
