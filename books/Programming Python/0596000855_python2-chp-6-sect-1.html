<P class="docText">For most software systems, a graphical user interface (GUI) has
become an expected part of the package. Even if the GUI acronym is
new to you, chances are that you are already familiar with such
interfaces -- the windows, buttons, and menus that we use to
interact with software programs. In fact, most of what we do on
computers today is done with some sort of point-and-click graphical
interface. From web browsers to system tools, programs are routinely
dressed-up with a GUI component to make them more flexible and easy
to use.
</P>

<P class="docText">In this part of the book, we will learn how to make Python scripts
sprout such graphical interfaces too, by studying examples of
programming with the Tkinter module -- a portable GUI library that
is a standard part of the Python system. As we'll see,
it's easy to program user interfaces in Python scripts, thanks
both to the simplicity of the language and the power of its GUI
libraries. As an added bonus, GUIs programmed in Python with Tkinter
are automatically portable to all major computer systems.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.1.1 GUI Programming Topics</H4>

<P class="docText">Because GUIs are a major area, I want to say a few more words about
this part of the book. To make them easier to absorb, GUI programming
topics are split over the next four chapters of this book:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">This chapter begins with a quick Tkinter tutorial to teach coding
basics. Interfaces are kept simple here on purpose, so you can master
the fundamentals before moving on to the following chapter's
interfaces. On the other hand, this chapter covers all the basics:
event processing, the <TT>pack</TT> geometry manager, using
inheritance and composition in GUIs, and more. As we'll see,
OOP (object-oriented programming) isn't required for Tkinter,
but it makes GUIs structured and reusable.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-7.html#python2-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A>
and <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-8.html#python2-CHP-8">Chapter 8</A> take you on a tour of the Tkinter
widget set.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[1]</A></sup> Roughly, <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-7.html#python2-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A>,
presents simple widgets, and <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-8.html#python2-CHP-8">Chapter 8</A>, covers
more advanced widgets and related tools. Most of the interfaces
devices you're accustomed to seeing show up here: sliders,
menus, dialogs, images, and their kin. These two chapters are not a
fully complete Tkinter reference (which could easily fill a large
book by itself), but should be enough to help you get started coding
substantial Python GUIs. The examples in these chapters are focused
on widgets and Tkinter tools, but Python's support for code
reuse is also explored along the way.
</P> <blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[1]</A></sup> The term "widget set" refers
to the objects used to build familiar point-and-click user interface
devices -- push-buttons, sliders, input fields, and so on. Tkinter
comes with Python classes that correspond to all the widgets
you're accustomed to seeing in graphical displays. Besides
widgets, Tkinter also comes with tools for other activities, such as
scheduling events to occur, waiting for socket data to arrive, and so
on.</p></blockquote> </LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-9.html#python2-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>, presents more complex examples that
use coding and widget techniques presented in the three preceding
chapters. It begins with an exploration of techniques for automating
common GUI tasks with Python. Although Tkinter is a full-featured
library, a small amount of reusable Python code can make its
interfaces even more powerful and easy to use. This chapter wraps up
by presenting a handful of complete GUI programs that implement text
editors, image viewers, clocks, and more.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Because GUIs are really cross-domain tools, other GUI examples will
also show up throughout the remainder of this book. For example,
we'll later see email GUIs, calculators, tree viewers, table
browsers, and so on. See the fourth GUI chapter for a list of forward
pointers to other Tkinter examples in this text.
</P>

<P class="docText">One point I'd like to make right away: most GUIs are dynamic
and interactive interfaces, and the best I can do here is show static
screen shots representing selected states in the interactions such
programs implement. This really won't do justice to most
examples. If you are not working along with the examples already, I
encourage you to run the GUI examples in this and later chapters on
your own.
</P>

<P class="docText">On Windows, the standard Python install comes with Tkinter support
built-in, so all these examples should work immediately. For other
systems, Pythons with Tkinter support are readily available as well
(see <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-APP-B.html#python2-APP-B">Appendix B</A>, and the top-level
<span class="docEmphasis">README-PP2E.txt</span> file for more details).
It's worth whatever extra install details you may need to
absorb, though; experimenting with these programs is a great way to
learn about both GUI programming, and Python itself.

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle"> Has Anyone Noticed That "GUI" Are the First Three Letters of "GUIDO"?</H2>

<P class="docText">Python's creator didn't originally set out to build a GUI
development tool, but Python's ease of use and rapid turnaround
have made this one of its primary roles. From an implementation
perspective, GUIs in Python are really just instances of C
extensions, and extendability was one of the main ideas behind
Python. When a script builds push-buttons and menus, it ultimately
talks to a C library; and when a script responds to a user event, a C
library ultimately talks back to Python.
</P>

<P class="docText">But from a practical point of view, GUIs are a critical part of
modern systems, and an ideal domain for a tool like Python. As
we'll see, Python's simple syntax and object-oriented
flavor blend well with the GUI model -- it's natural to
represent each device drawn on a screen as a Python class. Moreover,
Python's quick turnaround lets programmers experiment with
alternative layouts and behavior rapidly, in ways not possible with
traditional development techniques. In fact, you can usually make a
change to a Python-based GUI, and observe its effects in a matter of
seconds. Don't try this with C or C++.
