<H3 class="docSection1Title">6.3 Tkinter Overview</H3>

<P class="docText">Of all these GUI options, though, Tkinter is by far the de facto
standard way to implement portable user interfaces in Python today,
and the focus of this part of the book. Tkinter's portability,
availability, accessibility, documentation, and extensions have made
it the most widely used Python GUI solution for many years running.
Here are some of the reasons why:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Accessibility</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Tkinter is generally regarded as a lightweight toolkit, and one of
the simplest GUI solutions for Python available today. Unlike larger
frameworks, it is easy to get started in Tkinter right away, without
first having to grasp a much larger class interaction model. As
we'll see, programmers can create simple Tkinter GUIs in a few
lines of Python code, and scale up to writing industrial-strength
GUIs gradually.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Portability</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">A Python script that builds a GUI with Tkinter will run without
source code changes on all major window platforms today: Microsoft
Windows, X Windows (on Unix and Linux), and the Macintosh. Further,
that same script will provide a native look-and-feel to its users on
each of these platforms. A Python/Tkinter script looks like a Windows
program on Windows; on Unix and Linux, it provides the same
interaction but sports an appearance familiar to X Windows users; and
on the Mac, it looks like a Mac program should.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Availability</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Tkinter is a standard module in the Python library, shipped with the
interpreter. If you have Python, you have Tkinter. Moreover, most
Python installation packages (including the standard Python
self-installer for Windows) come with Tkinter support bundled.
Because of that, scripts written to use the Tkinter module work
immediately on most Python interpreters, without any extra
installation steps.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[4]</A></sup> Tkinter is also generally better supported than its
alternatives today. Because the underlying Tk library is also used by
the Tcl and Perl programming languages, it tends to receive more
development time and effort than other toolkits available.
</P> <blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[4]</A></sup>  Some Python distributions on
Unix-like platforms still come without Tk support bundled, so you may
need to add it on your machine. On some Unix and Linux platforms, you
may also need to set your Tcl/Tk library shell variables to use
Tkinter. See <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-APP-B.html#python2-APP-B">Appendix B</A> for install details; you
can usually sidestep Tk build details by finding an alternative
Python distribution with Tk bundled (e.g., Linux RPMs).</p></blockquote>

</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">Naturally, other factors such as documentation and extensions are
important when using a GUI toolkit too; let's take a quick look
at the story Tkinter has to tell on these fronts as well.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-6-SECT-3.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.3.1 Tkinter Documentation</H4>

<P class="docText">This book explores Tkinter fundamentals and most widgets tools, and
should be enough to get started with substantial GUI development in
Python. On the other hand, it is not an exhaustive reference to the
Tkinter library. Happily, at least one book dedicated to using
Tkinter in Python is now commercially available as I write this
paragraph, and others are on the way (see the Python books list at
<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A> for details). Besides
books, you can also now find Tkinter documentation online; a complete
set of Tkinter manuals is currently maintained on the web at
<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.pythonware.com/library">http://www.pythonware.com/library</A>.
</P>

<P class="docText">In addition, because the underlying Tk toolkit used by Tkinter is
also a de facto standard in the open source scripting community at
large, other documentation sources apply. For instance, because Tk
has also been adopted by the Tcl and Perl programming languages,
Tk-oriented books and documentation written for both of these are
directly applicable to Python/Tkinter as well (albeit, with some
syntactic mapping).
</P>

<P class="docText">Frankly, I learned Tkinter by studying Tcl/Tk texts and
references -- just replace Tcl strings with Python objects and you
have additional reference libraries at your disposal (see <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-6-SECT-6.html#python2-CHP-6-TABLE-2">Table 6-2</A>, the Tk to Tkinter conversion guide, at the
end of this chapter for help reading Tk documentation). For instance,
the Tcl/Tk Pocket Reference (O'Reilly) can serve as a nice
supplement to the Tkinter tutorial material in this part of the book.
Moreover, since Tk concepts are familiar to a large body of
programmers, Tk support is also readily available on the
Net.<A NAME="IXT-6-336987"></A>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-6-SECT-3.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.3.2 Tkinter Extensions</H4>

<P class="docText">Because Tkinter is so widely used, programmers also have access to
precoded Python extensions designed to work with or augment it. For
instance:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><span class="docPubcolor">PIL (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/default.htm">http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/</A>)</span></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The Python Imaging Library is an open source extension package that
adds image-processing tools to Python. Among other things, it extends
the basic Tkinter image object set, to add support for displaying
many image file types (see <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-7-SECT-9.html#python2-CHP-7-SECT-9">Section 7.9</A> at the end of <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-7.html#python2-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A> for details). Besides developing PIL,
PythonWare is also building GUI development tools for Python and
Tkinter programming, known as PythonWorks; visit their web site for
more details.
</P>
</DD><DT><span class="docPubcolor">PMW (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw">http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw</A>)</span></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Python Mega Widgets is an extension toolkit for building high-level
compound widgets in Python using the Tkinter module. It extends the
Tkinter API with a collection of more sophisticated widgets for
advanced GUI development, and a framework for implementing some of
your own. Among the precoded and extensible megawidgets shipped with
the package are notebooks, comboboxes, selection widgets, paned
widgets, scrolled widgets, dialog windows, button boxes, and an
interface to the Blt graph widget. The interface to PMW megawidgets
is similar to that of basic Tkinter widgets, so Python scripts can
freely mix PMW megawidgets with standard Tkinter widgets.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">IDLE (shipped with Python)</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The IDLE integrated Python development environment is both written in
Python with Tkinter and shipped and installed with the Python package
(if you have a recent Python interpreter, you should have IDLE
too -- on Windows, click the Start button, select the Programs
menu, and click the Python entry to find it). As described in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-APP-B.html#python2-APP-B">Appendix B</A>, IDLE provides syntax-coloring text editors
for Python code, point-and-click debugging, and more, and is an
example of Tkinter's utility.
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">If you plan on doing any commercial-grade GUI development with
Tkinter, you'll probably want to explore extensions such as PMW
and PIL after learning Tkinter basics in this text. They can save
development time and add pizzazz to your GUIs. See the Python-related
web sites mentioned earlier for up-to-date details and links.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">6.3.3 Tkinter Structure</H4>

<P class="docText">From a more nuts-and-bolts perspective, Tkinter is an integration
system that implies a somewhat unique program structure. We'll
see what this means in terms of code in a moment, but here is a brief
introduction to some of the terms and concepts at the core of Python
GUI programming.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-6-336988"></A><A NAME="IXT-6-336989"></A>Strictly speaking, Tkinter is simply the
name of Python's interface to Tk -- a GUI library originally
written for use with the Tcl programming language, and developed by
Tcl's creator, John Ousterhout. Python's Tkinter module
talks to Tk, and the Tk API in turn interfaces with the underlying
window system: Microsoft Windows, X Windows on Unix, or Macintosh.
</P>

<P class="docText">Python's Tkinter adds a software layer on top of Tk that allows
Python scripts to call out to Tk to build and configure interfaces,
and routes control back to Python scripts that handle user-generated
events (e.g., mouseclicks). That is, GUI calls are internally routed
from Python script, to Tkinter, to Tk; GUI events are routed from Tk,
to Tkinter, and back to a Python script. In <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-PART-V.html#python2-PART-V">Part V</A>, we'll know these transfers by their C
integration terms, extending and embedding.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[5]</A></sup>
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[5]</A></sup> Since I
brought it up: Tkinter is structured as a combination of the
Python-coded <TT>Tkinter</TT> module file, and an extension
module called <TT>_tkinter</TT> that is written in C.
<TT>_tkinter</TT> interfaces with the Tk library and
dispatches callbacks back to Python objects using embedding tools;
<TT>Tkinter</TT> adds a class-based interface on top of
<TT>_tkinter</TT>. You should always import
<TT>Tkinter</TT> (not <TT>_tkinter</TT>) in your
scripts, though; the latter is an implementation module for internal
use only (it was oddly named for a reason).</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Luckily, Python programmers don't normally need to care about
all this call routing going on internally; they simply make widgets
and register Python functions to handle widget events. Because of the
overall structure, though, event handlers are usually known as
callback handlers, because the GUI library "calls back"
to Python code when events occur.
</P>

<P class="docText">In fact, we'll find that Python/Tkinter programs are entirely
event-driven: they build displays and register handlers for events,
and then do nothing but wait for events to occur. During the wait,
the Tk GUI library runs an event loop that watches for mouseclicks,
keyboard presses, and so on. All application program processing
happens in the registered callback handlers, in response to events.
Further, any information needed across events must be stored in
long-lived references like global variables and class instance
attributes. The notion of a traditional linear program control-flow
doesn't really apply in the GUI domain; you need to think in
terms of smaller chunks.
</P>

<P class="docText">In Python, Tk also becomes object-oriented just because Python is
object-oriented: the Tkinter layer exports Tk's API as Python
classes. With Tkinter, we can either use a simple function-call
approach to create widgets and interfaces, or apply OO techniques
such as inheritance and composition to customize and extend the base
set of Tkinter classes. Larger Tkinter GUIs generally are constructed
as trees of linked Tkinter widget objects, and are often implemented
as Python classes to provide structure and retain state information
between events. As we'll see in this part of the book, a
Tkinter GUI coded with classes almost by default becomes a reusable
software component.
