GUIs always have a root window, whether you get it by default or
create it explicitly by calling the <TT>Tk</TT> object
constructor. This main root window is the one that opens when your
program runs, and is where you generally pack your most important
widgets. In addition, Tkinter scripts can create any number of
independent windows, generated and popped up on demand, by creating
<TT>Toplevel</TT> widget objects.
</P>

<P class="docText">Each <TT>Toplevel</TT> object created produces a new window
on the display, and automatically adds it to the program's GUI
event-loop processing stream (you don't need to call the
<TT>mainloop</TT> method of new windows to activate them).

it doesn't specify a real parent), but also creates two

function independently of the root window, as seen in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-FIG-3">Figure 7-3</A>.

<P class="docText">The two <TT>Toplevel</TT> windows on the right are
full-fledged windows; they can be independently iconified, maximized,
and so on. <TT>Toplevels</TT> are typically used to
implement multiple-window displays, and pop-up modal and nonmodal
dialogs (more on dialogs in the next section). They stay up until
explicitly destroyed, or the application that created them exits.
</P>

<P class="docText">But it's important to know that although
<TT>Toplevel</TT>s are independently active windows, they
are not separate processes -- if your program exits, all its
windows are erased, including all <TT>Toplevel</TT> windows
it may have created. We'll learn how to work around this rule
later by launching independent GUI programs.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.3.1 Toplevel and Tk Widgets</H4>

<P class="docText">A <TT>Toplevel</TT> is roughly like a
<TT>Frame</TT> that is split off into its own window, and
has additional methods that allow you to deal with top-level window
properties. The <TT>Tk</TT> widget is roughly like a
<TT>Toplevel</TT>, but is used to represent the application
root window. We got one for free in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-EX-3">Example 7-3</A>
because the <TT>Label</TT> had a default parent; in other
scripts, we've made the <TT>Tk</TT> root more
explicit by creating it directly like this:
</P>

<PRE>root = Tk()
Label(root, text='Popups').pack()        # on explicit Tk() root window
root.mainloop()</PRE>

<P class="docText">In fact, because Tkinter GUIs are built as a hierarchy, you always
get a root window by default, whether it is named explicitly like
this or not. You should generally use the root to display top-level
information of some sort -- if you don't attach widgets to
the root, it shows up as an odd empty window when you run your
script. Technically, you can suppress the default root creation logic
and make multiple root windows with the <TT>Tk</TT> widget,
as in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-EX-4">Example 7-4</A>.

<P class="docText">There are a few operational details worth noticing here, all of which
are more obvious if you run this script on your machine:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Intercepting closes: protocol</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Because the window manager close event has been intercepted by this
script using the top-level widget <TT>protocol</TT> method,
pressing the X in the top-right corner doesn't do anything in
the three <TT>Toplevel</TT> pop-ups. The name string
<TT>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</TT> identifies the close operation.
You can use this interface to disallow closes apart from the widgets
your script creates -- the function created by this script's
<TT>lambda:0</TT> does nothing but return zero.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Killing one window: destroy</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Pressing the big black buttons in any one of the three pop-ups only
kills that pop-up, because the pop-up runs the widget
<TT>destroy</TT> method. The other windows live on, much as
you would expect of a pop-up dialog window.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Killing all windows: quit</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">To kill all the windows at once and end the GUI application (really,
its active <TT>mainloop</TT> call), the root window's
button runs the <TT>quit</TT> method instead. Pressing the
root window's button ends the application.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Window titles: title</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">As introduced in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-6.html#python2-CHP-6">Chapter 6</A>, top-level window
widgets (<TT>Tk</TT> and <TT>Toplevel</TT>) have
a <TT>title</TT> method that lets you change the text
displayed on the top border. Here, the window title text is set to
the string "Sing..." to override the default
"tk".
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Geometry management</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Top-level windows are containers for other widgets, much like a
standalone <TT>Frame</TT>. Unlike frames, though, top-level
window widgets are never themselves packed (or gridded, or placed).
To embed widgets, this script passes its windows as parent arguments
to label and button constructors.
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">In addition, top-level window widgets support other kinds of
protocols that we will utilize later on this tour:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">State</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The <TT>iconify</TT> and <TT>withdraw</TT>
top-level widget methods allow scripts to hide and erase a window on
the fly; <TT>deiconify</TT> redraws a hidden or erased
window. The <TT>state</TT> method queries a window's
state (it returns "iconic", "withdrawn", or
"normal"), and <TT>lift</TT> and
<TT>lower</TT> raise and lower a window with respect to
others. See the alarm scripts near the end of <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-8.html#python2-CHP-8">Chapter 8</A> for usage.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Menus</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Each top-level window can have its own window menus too; both the
<TT>Tk</TT> and <TT>Toplevel</TT> widgets have a
<TT>menu</TT> option used to associate a horizontal menu
bar of pull-down option lists. This menu bar looks as it should on
each platform on which your scripts are run. We'll explore
menus early in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-8.html#python2-CHP-8">Chapter 8</A>.
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">Notice that this script passes its <TT>Toplevel</TT>
constructor calls an explicit parent widget -- the
<TT>Tk</TT> root window (that is,
<TT>Toplevel(root)</TT>). <TT>Toplevel</TT>s can
be associated with a parent like other widgets, even though they are
not visually embedded in their parents. I coded the script this way
to avoid what seems like an odd feature; if coded instead like this:
</P>

<PRE>win = Toplevel()                                    # new window</PRE>

<P class="docText">If no <TT>Tk</TT> root yet exists, this call actually
generates a default <TT>Tk</TT> root window to serve as the
<TT>Toplevel</TT>'s parent, just like any other
widget call without a parent argument. The problem is that this makes
the position of the following line crucial:
</P>

<PRE>root = Tk()                                         # explicit root</PRE>

<P class="docText">If this line shows up above the <TT>Toplevel</TT> calls, it
creates the single root window as expected. But if you move this line
below the <TT>Toplevel</TT> calls, Tkinter creates a
default <TT>Tk</TT> root window that is different than the
one created by the script's explicit <TT>Tk</TT>
call. You wind up with two <TT>Tk</TT> roots just as in
<A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-EX-5">Example 7-5</A>. Move the <TT>Tk</TT> call
below the <TT>Toplevel</TT> calls and rerun it to see what
I mean -- you'll get a fourth window that is completely
empty! As a rule of thumb, to avoid such oddities, make your
<TT>Tk</TT> root windows early and explicit.
</P>

<P class="docText">All of the top-level protocol interfaces are only available on
top-level window widgets, but you can often access them by going
through other widgets' <TT>master</TT>
attributes -- links to the widget parents. For example, to set the
title of a window in which a frame is contained, say something like
this:
</P>

<PRE>theframe.master.title('Spam demo')    # master is the container window</PRE>

<P class="docText">Naturally, you should only do so if you're sure that the frame
will only be used in one kind of window. General-purpose attachable
components coded as classes, for instance, should leave window
property settings to their client applications.
</P>

<P class="docText">Top-level widgets have additional tools, some of which we may not
meet in this book. For instance, under Unix window managers, you can
also call icon-related methods to change the bitmap used for
top-level windows (<TT>iconbitmask</TT>), and set the name
used on the window's icon (<TT>iconname</TT>).
Because such icon options are only useful when scripts run on Unix,
see other Tk and Tkinter resources for more details on this topic.
For now, the next scheduled stop on this tour explores one of the
more common uses of top-level windows.<A NAME="IXTR3-18"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-19"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-20"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-21"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-22"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-23"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-24"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-25"></A>
