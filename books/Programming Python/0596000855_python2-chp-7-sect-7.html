<P class="docText">This section introduces three widget types -- the
<TT>Checkbutton</TT> (a multiple-choice input widget), the
<TT>Radionbutton</TT> (a single-choice device), and the
<TT>Scale</TT> (sometimes known as a "slider").
All are variations on a theme, and somewhat related to simple
buttons, so we'll explore them as a group here. To make these
widgets more fun to play with, we'll reuse the
<TT>dialogTable</TT> module shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-7-SECT-4.html#python2-CHP-7-EX-8">Example 7-8</A> to provide callbacks for widget selections
(callbacks pop up dialog boxes). Along the way, we'll also use
the Tkinter variables we just met to communicate with these
widgets' state settings.

<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-193"></A>The
<TT>Checkbutton</TT> and <TT>Radiobutton</TT>
widgets are designed to be associated with Tkinter variables: pushing
the button changes the value of the variable, and setting the
variable changes the state of the button it is linked to. In fact,
Tkinter variables are central to the operation of these widgets:

<LI><P class="docList">A collection of radiobuttons imposes a mutually exclusive
single-choice model, by giving each button a unique value and the
same Tkinter variable.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Both kinds of buttons provide both <TT>command</TT> and
<TT>variable</TT> options. The <TT>command</TT>
option lets you register a callback to be run immediately on
button-press events, much like normal <TT>Button</TT>
widgets. But by associating a Tkinter variable with the
<TT>variable</TT> option, you can also fetch or change
widget state at any time, by fetching or changing the value of the
widget's associated variable.

it also adds a button that dumps the current state of all
checkbuttons, and attaches an instance of the Quitter button we built

<P class="docText">In terms of program code, checkbuttons resemble normal buttons; they
are even packed within a container widget. Operationally, though,
they are a bit different. As you can probably tell from this figure
(and can better tell by running this live), a checkbutton works as a
toggle  -- pressing one changes its state from off to on
(deselected to selected); or from on to off again. When a checkbox is
selected, it has a checked display, and its associated
<TT>IntVar</TT> variable has a value of 1; when deselected,
its display is empty, and its <TT>IntVar</TT> has value 0.
</P>

<P class="docText">To simulate an enclosing application, the State button in this
display triggers the script's <TT>report</TT> method
to display the current values of all five toggles on the
<TT>stdout</TT> stream. Here is the output after a few
pushes:

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0
1 0 0 1 1</PRE>

<P class="docText">Really, these are the values of the five Tkinter variables associated
with the checkbuttons with <TT>variable</TT> options, but
they give the buttons' values when queried. This script
associates <TT>Intvar</TT> variables with each of
checkbuttons in this display, since they are
or 1 binary indicators. <TT>StringVars</TT> will work here
too, although their <TT>get</TT> methods would return
strings "0" or "1" (not integers), and their
initial state is an empty string (not the integer 0).
</P>

<P class="docText">This widget's <TT>command</TT> option lets you
register a callback to be run each time the button is pressed. To
illustrate, this script registers a standard dialog demo call as a
handler for each of the checkbuttons: pressing a button changes the
toggle's state, but also pops up one of the dialog windows we
visited earlier on this tour.
</P>

<P class="docText">Interestingly, you can run the <TT>report</TT> method
interactively too. When working this way, widgets pop up as lines are
typed and are fully active even without calling

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-194"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-195"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-196"></A>When I first studied this widget, my
initial reaction was: So why do we need Tkinter variables here at all
when we can register button-press callbacks? Linked variables may
seem superfluous at first glance, but they simplify some GUI chores.
Rather than asking you to accept this blindly, though, let me explain
why.
</P>

<P class="docText">Keep in mind that a checkbuttons's <TT>command</TT>
callback will be run on every press -- whether the press toggles
the checkbutton to a selected or deselected state. Because of that,
if you want to run an action immediately when a checkbutton is
pressed, you will generally want to check the button's current
value in the callback handler. Because there is no checkbutton
"get" method for fetching values, you usually need to
interrogate an associated variable to see if the button is on or off.
</P>

<P class="docText">Moreover, some GUIs simply let users set checkbuttons without running
<TT>command</TT> callbacks at all, and fetch button
settings at some later point in the program. In such a scenario,
variables serve to automatically keep track of button settings. The
<TT>demoCheck</TT> script's <TT>report</TT>
method is representative of this latter approach.
</P>

<P class="docText">Of course, you could manually keep track of each button's state
in press callback handlers too. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-EX-23">Example 7-23</A> keeps
its own list of state toggles, and updates it manually on
<TT>command</TT> press callbacks.

pressing one <TT>Radiobutton</TT> widget in a group
automatically deselects the one pressed last. In other words, at most
one can be selected at once. In Tkinter, associating all radiobuttons

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-206"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-207"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-208"></A>So why variables here? For one thing,
radiobuttons also have no "get" widget method to fetch
the selection in the future. More importantly, in radiobutton groups,
the <TT>value</TT> and <TT>variable</TT> settings
turn out to be the whole basis of single-choice behavior. In fact, to
make radiobuttons work normally at all, it's crucial that they
all are associated with the same Tkinter variable, and all have
distinct value settings. To truly understand why, though, you need to
know a bit more about how radiobuttons and variables do their stuff.
</P>

<P class="docText">We've already seen that changing a widget changes its
associated Tkinter variable, and vice versa. But it's also true
that changing a variable in any way automatically changes every
widget it is associated with. In the world of radiobuttons, pressing
a button sets a shared variable, which in turn impacts other buttons
associated with that variable. Assuming that all buttons have
distinct values, this works as you expect: When a button press
changes the shared variable to the pressed button's value, all
other buttons are deselected, simply because the variable has been
changed to a value not their own.
</P>

<P class="docText">This ripple effect is a bit subtle, but it might help to know that
within a group of radiobuttons sharing the same variable, if you
assign a set of buttons the same value, the entire set will be
selected if any one of them is pressed. Consider <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-EX-26">Example 7-26</A> and <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-FIG-29">Figure 7-29</A>, for example;
because radiobuttons 0, 3, 6, and 9 all have value
(the remainder of division by 3), all are selected if any are
selected (<A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-FIG-29">Figure 7-29</A>).

<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.7.2.3 Hold on to your variables</H5>

<P class="docText">One minor word of caution: you should generally hold on to the
Tkinter variable object used to link radiobuttons for as long as the
radiobuttons are displayed. Assign it to a module global variable,
store it in a long-lived data structure, or save it as an attribute
of a long-lived class object as done by
<TT>demoRadio</TT> -- just as long as you retain a
reference to it somehow. You normally will fetch state anyhow, so
it's unlikely that you'll ever care about what I'm
about to tell you.
</P>

<P class="docText">But in the current Tkinter, variable classes have a
<TT>__del__</TT> destructor that automatically unsets a
generated <TT>Tk</TT> variable when the Python object is
reclaimed (i.e., garbage-collected). The upshot is that your
radiobuttons may all be deselected if the variable object is
collected, at least until the next press resets the
<TT>Tk</TT> variable to a new value. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-EX-29">Example 7-29</A> shows one way to trigger this.

from Tkinter import *

def radio1():                   # local vars are temporary
    #global tmp                 # making it global fixes the problem
    tmp = IntVar()

<P class="docText">This should come up with button 5 selected initially, but
doesn't. The variable referenced by local
<TT>tmp</TT> is reclaimed on function exit, the
<TT>Tk</TT> variable is unset, and the 5 setting is lost
(all buttons come up unselected). These radiobuttons work fine,
though, one you start pressing them, because that resets the
<TT>Tk</TT> variable. Uncommenting the
<TT>global</TT> statement here makes 5 start out set, as
expected.
</P>

<P class="docText">Of course, this is an atypical example -- as coded, there is no
way to know which button is pressed, because the variable isn't
saved (and <TT>command</TT> isn't set). In fact, this
is so obscure that I'll just refer you to
<I>demo-radio-clear2.py</I> on the CD for an example
that works hard to trigger this oddity in other ways. You probably
won't care, but you can't say that I didn't warn

<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-216"></A>
<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-217"></A>Scales
(sometimes called "sliders") are used to select among a
range of numeric values. Moving the scale's position with mouse
drags or clicks moves the widget's value among a range of
integers, and triggers Python callbacks if registered.
</P>

<P class="docText">Like checkbuttons and radiobuttons, scales have both a
<TT>command</TT> option for registering an event-driven
callback handler to be run right away when the scale is moved, as
well as a <TT>variable</TT> option for associating a
Tkinter variable that allows the scale's position to be fetched
and set at arbitrary times. You can process scale settings when they
are made, or let the user pick a setting for later use.
</P>

<P class="docText">In addition, scales have a third processing
option -- <TT>get</TT> and <TT>set</TT>
methods that scripts may call to access scale values directly without
associating variables. Because scale <TT>command</TT>
movement callbacks also get the current scale setting value as an
argument, it's often enough just to provide a callback for this
widget, without resorting to either linked variables or get/set
method calls.

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">The <TT>label</TT> option provides text that appears along
with the scale, <TT>length</TT> specifies an initial size
in pixels, and <TT>orient</TT> specifies an axis.

the scale range's minimum and maximum values (note that
"from" is a Python reserved word, but "from_"
is not).
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">The <TT>tickinterval</TT> option sets the number of units
between marks drawn at regular intervals next to the scale (the
default
means no marks are drawn).
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">The <TT>resolution</TT> option provides the number of units
that the scale's value jumps on each drag or left mouseclick
event (defaults to 1).
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">The <TT>showvalue</TT> option can be used to show or hide
the scale's current value next to its slider bar (the default
<TT>showvalue=YES</TT> means it is drawn).

<P class="docText">Frankly, the only reason Tkinter variables are used in the
<TT>demoScale</TT> script at all is to synchronize scales.
To make the demo interesting, this script associates the same Tkinter
variable object with both scales. As we learned in the last section,
changing a widget changes its variable, but changing a variable also
changes all the widgets it is associated with. In the world of
sliders, moving the slide updates that variable, which in turn might
update other widgets associated with the same variable. Because this
script links one variable with two scales, it keeps them
automatically in sync: moving one scale moves the other too, because
the shared variable is changed in the process and so updates the
other scale as a side effect.
</P>

<P class="docText">Linking scales like this may or may not be typical of your
applications (and borders on deep magic), but it's a powerful
tool once you get your mind around it. By linking multiple widgets on
a display with Tkinter variables, you can keep them automatically in
sync, without making manual adjustments in callback handlers. On the
other hand, the synchronization could be implemented without a shared
variable at all by calling one scale's <TT>set</TT>
method from a move callback handler of the other. I'll leave
such a manual mutation as a suggested exercise, though. One
person's deep magic might be another's evil
hack.<A NAME="IXTR3-50"></A>
