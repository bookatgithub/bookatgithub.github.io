<P class="docText">Now that we've built a handful of similar demo launcher
programs, let's write a few top-level scripts to combine them.
Because the demos were coded as both reusable classes and scripts,
they can be deployed as attached frame components, run in their own
top-level windows, and launched as standalone programs. All three
options illustrate code reuse in action.

<P class="docText">Naturally, this example is artificial, but it illustrates the power
of composition when applied to building larger GUI displays. If you
pretend that each of the four attached demo objects was something
more useful, like a text editor, calculator, or clock, you'll
better appreciate the point of this example.
</P>

<P class="docText">Besides demo object frames, this composite window also contains no
less than five instances of the Quitter button we wrote earlier (any
one of which can end the GUI), and a States button to dump the
current values of all the embedded demo objects at once (it calls
each object's <TT>report</TT> method, if it has one).

<P class="docText">The only substantially tricky part of this script is its use of
Python's built-in <TT>__import__</TT> function to
import a module by a name string. Look at the following two lines
from the script's <TT>addComponents</TT> function:
</P>

<PRE>module = __import__(demo)             # import module by name string
part = module.Demo(root)              # attach an instance of its Demo</PRE>

<P class="docText">This is equivalent to saying something like this:</P>

<PRE>import 'demoDlg'            
part = 'demoDlg'.Demo(root) </PRE>

<P class="docText">except that this is not legal Python syntax -- the module name in
import statements must be a Python variable, not a string. To be
generic, <TT>addComponents</TT> steps through a list of
name strings, and relies on <TT>__import__</TT> to import
and return the module identified by each string. It's as though
all of these statements were run:
</P>

<PRE>import demoDlg, demoRadio, demoCheck, demoScale
part = demoDlg.Demo(root)
part = demoRadio.Demo(root)
part = demoCheck.Demo(root)
part = demoScale.Demo(root)</PRE>

<P class="docText">But because the script uses a list of name strings, it's easier
to change the set of demos embedded -- simply change the list, not
lines of executable code. Moreover, such data-driven code tends to be
more compact, less redundant, and easier to debug and maintain.
Incidentally, modules can also be imported from name strings by
dynamically constructing and running import statements like this:
</P>

<PRE>for demo in demoModules:
    exec 'from %s import Demo' % demo        # make and run a from
    part = Demo(root)                        # or eval('Demo')(window)</PRE>

<P class="docText">The <TT>exec</TT> statement compiles and runs a Python
statement string (here, a <TT>from</TT> to load a
module's <TT>Demo</TT> class); it works here as if
the statement string were pasted into the source code where the
<TT>exec</TT> statement appears. Because it supports any
sort of Python statement, this technique is more general than the
<TT>__import__</TT> call, but, it can also be slower, since
it must parse code strings before running them.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[2]</A></sup> But that slowness may not matter in a
GUI; users tend to be slower than parsers.
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[2]</A></sup> As
we'll see later, <TT>exec</TT> can also be dangerous
if running code strings fetched from users or network connections.
That's not an issue for the hardcoded strings in this
example.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">As we saw in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-6.html#python2-CHP-6">Chapter 6</A>, attaching nested frames
like this is really just one way to reuse GUI code structured as
classes. It's just as easy to customize such interfaces by
subclassing, rather than embedding. Here, though, we're more
interested in deploying an existing widget package, rather than
changing it; the next two sections show two other ways to present
such packages to users.

<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.8.3.1 Cross-program communication</H5>

<P class="docText">Spawning GUIs as programs is the ultimate in code independence, but
makes the lines of communication between components more complex. For
instance, because the demos run as programs here, there is no easy
way to run all their <TT>report</TT> methods from the
launching script's window pictured in the middle of <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-FIG-34">Figure 7-34</A>. In fact, the States button is gone this time,
and we only get <TT>PortableLauncher</TT> messages in

demoDlg
demoRadio

<P class="docText">On some platforms, messages printed by the demo programs (including
their own State buttons) may show up the original console window
where this script is launched; on Windows, the
<TT>os.spawnv</TT> call used to start programs in
<TT>launchmodes</TT> completely disconnects the child
program's <TT>stdout</TT> stream from its parent.
Regardless, there is no way to call all demos' <TT>report</TT>
methods at once -- they are spawned programs in distinct
address spaces, not imported modules.
</P>

<P class="docText">Of course, we could trigger report methods in the spawned programs
with some of the IPC mechanisms we met in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-3.html#python2-CHP-3">Chapter 3</A>. For instance:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">The demos could be instrumented to catch a user signal, and run their
<TT>report</TT> in response.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">They could also watch for request strings sent by the launching
program to show up in pipes or fifos -- the
<TT>demoAll</TT> launching program would essentially act as
a client, and the demo GUIs as servers.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Independent programs can also converse this way over sockets -- a

</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Given their event-driven nature, GUI-based programs may need to be
augmented with threads or timer-event callbacks to periodically check
for such incoming messages on pipes, fifos, or sockets (e.g., see the
<TT>after</TT> method call described near the end of the
next chapter). But since this is all well beyond the scope of these
simple demo programs, I'll leave such cross-program extensions
up to more parallel-minded readers.

<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.8.3.2 Coding for reusability</H5>

<P class="docText">A postscript: I coded all the demo launcher bars deployed by the last
three examples to demonstrate all the different ways that their
widgets can be used. They were not developed with general-purpose
reusability in mind; in fact, they're not really useful outside
the context of introducing widgets in this book.
</P>

<P class="docText">That was by design; most Tkinter widgets are easy to use once you
learn their interfaces, and Tkinter already provides lots of
configuration flexibility by itself. But if I had in mind to code
checkboxes and radiobutton classes to be reused as general library
components, they would have to be structured differently:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Extra widgets</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">They would not display anything but radio- and checkbuttons. As is,
the demos each embed State and Quit buttons for illustration, but
there really should be just one Quit per top-level window.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Geometry management</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">They would allow for different button arrangements, and not pack (or
grid) themselves at all. In a true general-purpose reuse scenario,
it's often better to leave a component's geometry
management up to its caller.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Usage mode limitations</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">They would either have to export complex interfaces to support all
possible Tkinter configuration options and modes, or make some
limiting decisions that support one common use only. For instance,
these buttons can either run callbacks at press time or provide their
state later in the application.
</P>

</DL>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-7-EX-35">Example 7-35</A> shows one way to code check and

callers to keep the interface simple -- state fetches, instead of
press callbacks.

<P class="docText">The two classes in this module demonstrate how easy it is to wrap
Tkinter interfaces to make them easier to use -- they completely
abstract away many of the tricky parts of radiobutton and checkbox
bars. For instance, you can forget about linked variable details
completely if you use such higher-level classes instead; simply make
objects with option lists and call their <TT>state</TT>
methods later. If you follow this path to its conclusion, you might
just wind up with a higher-level widget library on the order of the
<TT>PMW</TT> package mentioned in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-6.html#python2-CHP-6">Chapter 6</A>.
</P>

<P class="docText">On the other hand, these classes are still not universally
applicable; if you need to run actions when these buttons are
pressed, for instance, you'll need to use other high-level
interfaces. Luckily, Python/Tkinter already provides plenty. Later in
this book, we'll again use the widget combination and reuse
techniques introduced in this section to construct larger GUIs. For
now, this first widget tour chapter is about to make one last
stop -- the photo shop.
