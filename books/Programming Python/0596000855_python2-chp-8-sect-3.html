<TT>Scrollbar</TT>sare designed for
navigating through the contents of other widgets. Because it is
common to use these widgets together, let's study them both at
once. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-9">Example 8-9</A> builds both a

    ScrolledList(options).mainloop()</PRE>


<P class="docText">This module can be run standalone to experiment with these widgets,
but is also designed to be useful as a library object. By passing in
different selection lists to the <TT>options</TT> argument
and redefining the <TT>runCommand</TT> method in a
subclass, the <TT>ScrolledList</TT> component class defined
here can be reused any time you need to display a scrollable list.
With just a little forethought, it's easy to extend the Tkinter
library with Python classes.
</P>

<P class="docText">When run standalone, this script generates the window shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-12">Figure 8-12</A>. It's a <TT>Frame</TT>, with a
<TT>Listbox</TT> on its left containing 20 generated
entries (the fifth has been clicked), along with an associated
<TT>Scrollbar</TT> on its right for moving through the
list. If you move the scroll, the list moves, and vice versa.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.3.1 Programming Listboxes</H4>

<P class="docText">Listboxes are straightforward to use, but they are populated and
processed in somewhat unique ways compared to the widgets we've
seen so far. Many listbox calls accept a passed-in index to refer to
an entry in the list. Indexes start at integer
and grow higher, but Tkinter also accepts special name strings in
place of integer offsets -- "end" to refer to the end
of the list, "active" to denote the line selected, and
more. This generally yields more than one way to code listbox calls.
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, this script adds items to the listbox in this window by
calling its <TT>insert</TT> method, with successive offsets
(starting at zero):
</P>

<PRE>list.insert(pos, label)
pos = pos + 1</PRE>

<P class="docText">But you can also fill a list by simply adding items at the end
without keeping a position counter at all, with either of these
statements:
</P>

<PRE>list.insert('end', label)     # add at end: no need to count positions
list.insert(END, label)       # END is preset to 'end' inside Tkinter</PRE>

<P class="docText">The listbox widget doesn't have anything like the
<TT>command</TT> option we use to register callback
handlers for button presses, so you either need to fetch listbox
selections while processing other widgets' events (e.g., a
button press elsewhere in the GUI), or tap into other event protocols
to process user selections. To fetch a selected value, this script
binds the <TT>&lt;Double-1&gt;</TT> left mouse button
double-click event to a callback handler method with
<TT>bind</TT> (seen earlier on this tour).
</P>

<P class="docText">In the double-click handler, this script grabs the selected item out
of the listbox with this pair of listbox method calls:
</P>

<PRE>index = self.listbox.curselection()       # get selection index
label = self.listbox.get(index)           # fetch text by its index</PRE>

<P class="docText">Here, too, you can code this differently. Either of the following
lines have the same effect; they get the contents of the line at
index "active" -- the one selected:
</P>

<PRE>label = self.listbox.get('active')        # fetch from active index
label = self.listbox.get(ACTIVE)          # ACTIVE='active' in Tkinter</PRE>

<P class="docText">For illustration purposes, the class's default
<TT>runCommand</TT> method prints the value selected each
time you double-click an entry in the list -- as fetched by this
script, it comes back as a string reflecting the text in the selected
entry:

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.3.2 Programming Scrollbars</H4>

<P class="docText">The deepest magic in this script, though, boils down to two lines of
code:
</P>

<PRE>sbar.config(command=list.yview)              # call list.yview when I move
list.config(yscrollcommand=sbar.set)         # call sbar.set when I move</PRE>

<P class="docText">The scrollbar and listbox are effectively cross-linked to each other
through these configuration options; their values simply refer to
bound widget methods of the other. By linking like this, Tkinter
automatically keeps the two widgets in sync with each other as they
move. Here's how this works:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">Moving a scrollbar invokes the callback handler registered with its
<TT>command</TT> option. Here,
<TT>list.yview</TT> refers to a built-in listbox method
that adjusts the listbox display proportionally, based on arguments
passed to the handler.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Moving a listbox vertically invokes the callback handler registered
with its <TT>yscrollcommand</TT> option. In this script,
the <TT>sbar.set</TT> built-in method adjusts a scrollbar
proportionally.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">In other words, moving one automatically moves the other. It turns
out that every scrollable object in
Tkinter -- <TT>Listbox</TT>, <TT>Entry</TT>,
<TT>Text</TT>, and <TT>Canvas</TT> -- has
built-in <TT>yview</TT> and <TT>xview</TT>
methods to process incoming vertical and horizontal scroll callbacks,
as well as <TT>yscrollcommand</TT> and
<TT>xscrollcommand</TT> options for specifying an
associated scrollbar's callback handler. Scrollbars all have a
<TT>command</TT> option, to name a handler to call on
moves. Internally, Tkinter passes information to all these methods
that specifies their new position (e.g., "go 10% down from the
top"), but your scripts need never deal with that level of
detail.
</P>

<P class="docText">Because the scrollbar and listbox have been cross-linked in their
option settings, moving the scrollbar automatically moves the list,
and moving the list automatically moves the scrollbar. To move the
scrollbar, either drag the solid part or click on its arrows or empty
areas. To move the list, click on the list and move the mouse pointer
above or below the listbox without releasing the mouse button. In
both cases, the list and scrollbar move in unison. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-13">Figure 8-13</A> is the scene after moving down a few entries
in the list, one way or another.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.3.3 Packing Scrollbars</H4>

<P class="docText">Finally, remember that widgets packed last are always clipped first
when a window is shrunk. Because of that, it's important to
pack scrollbars in a display as soon as possible, so that they are
the last to go when the window becomes too small for everything. You
can generally make due with less than complete listbox text, but the
scrollbar is crucial for navigating through the list. As <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-14">Figure 8-14</A> shows, shrinking this script's window
cuts out part of the list, but retains the scrollbar.
</P>

<CENTER>

<IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="75" src="FILES/ppy2_0814.gif" ALT="figs/ppy2_0814.gif"></CENTER>

<P class="docText">At the same time, you don't generally want a scrollbar to
expand with a window, so be sure to pack it with just a
<TT>fill=Y</TT> (or <TT>fill=X</TT> for a
horizontal scroll), and not an <TT>expand=YES</TT>.
Expanding this example's window, for instance, makes the
listbox grow along with the window, but keeps the scrollbar attached
to the right, and of the same size.
</P>

<P class="docText">We'll see both scrollbars and listboxes repeatedly in later
examples in this and later chapters (flip ahead to PyEdit, PyForm,
PyTree, and ShellGui for more examples). And although the example
script in this section captures the fundamentals, I should point out
that there is more to both scrollbars and listboxes than meets the
eye here.
</P>

<P class="docText">For example, it's just as easy to add horizontal scrollbars to
scrollable widgets; they are programmed almost exactly like the
vertical one implemented here, but callback handler names start with
"x", not "y", and an
<TT>orient='horizontal'</TT> configuration option is set
for the scrollbar object (see the later PyEdit and PyTree programs
for examples). Listboxes can also be useful input devices even
without attached scrollbars; they also accept color, font, and relief
configuration options, and support multiple selections (the default
is <TT>selectmode=SINGLE</TT>).
</P>

<P class="docText">Scrollbars see more kinds of GUI action too -- they can be
associated with other kinds of widgets in the Tkinter library. For
instance, it is common to attach one to the <TT>Text</TT>
widget; which brings us to the next point of interest on this
tour.<A NAME="IXTR3-78"></A>
