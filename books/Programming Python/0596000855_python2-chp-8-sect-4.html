<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-242"></A>It's
been said that Tkinter's strongest points may be its text and
canvas widgets. Both provide a remarkable amount of functionality.
For instance, the Tkinter <TT>Text</TT> widget was powerful
enough to implement the Grail web browser, discussed in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>; it supports complex font style settings,
embedded images, and much more. The Tkinter <TT>Canvas</TT>
widget, a general-purpose drawing device, has also been the basis of
sophisticated image processing and visualization applications.
</P>

<P class="docText">In <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-9.html#python2-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>, we'll put these two widgets to
use to implement text editors (PyEdit), paint programs (PyDraw),
clock GUIs (PyClock), and photo slideshows (PyView). For the purposes
of this tour chapter, though, let's start out using these
widgets in simpler ways. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-10">Example 8-10</A> implements a
simple scrolled-text display, which knows how to fill its display
with a text string or file.

this script is careful to pack the scrollbar first so that it is cut
out of the display last as the window shrinks, and arranges for the
embedded <TT>Text</TT> object to expand in both directions
as the window grows. When run with a filename argument, this script
makes the window shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-15">Figure 8-15</A>; it embeds a

f = open('temp.txt', 'w')
for i in range(250):
    f.write('%03d)  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\n' % i)

<P class="docText">To view a file, pass its name on the command line -- its text is
automatically displayed in the new window. By default, it is shown in
a non-fixed-width font, but we'll pass a

to change that.
</P>

<P class="docText">Notice the "PP2E scrolledtext" message printed when this
script runs. Because there is also a
<I>ScrolledText.py</I> file in the standard Python
distribution with a very different interface, the one here identifies
itself when run or imported so you can tell which one you've
got. If the standard one ever goes away, import the one listed here
for a simple text browser, and adjust configuration calls to include
a ".text" qualifier level (the library version subclasses
<TT>Text</TT>, not <TT>Frame</TT>).
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-4.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.4.1 Programming the Text Widget</H4>

<P class="docText">To understand how this script works at all, though, we have to detour
into a few <TT>Text</TT> widget details here. Earlier we
met the <TT>Entry</TT> and <TT>Message</TT>
widgets, which address a subset of the <TT>Text</TT>
widget's uses. The <TT>Text</TT> widget is much
richer in both features and interfaces -- it supports both input
and display of multiple lines of text, editing operations for both
programs and interactive users, multiple fonts and colors, and much
more. <TT>Text</TT> objects are created, configured, and
packed just like any other widget, but they have properties all their
own.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-4.1.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.4.1.1 Text is a Python string</H5>

<P class="docText">Although the <TT>Text</TT> widget is a powerful tool, its
interface seems to boil down to two core concepts. First of all, the
content of a <TT>Text</TT> widget is represented as a
string in Python scripts, and multiple lines are separated with the
normal <TT>\n</TT> line terminator. The string
<TT>'Words\ngo</TT> <TT>here'</TT>, for instance,
represents two lines when stored in or fetched from a
<TT>Text</TT> widget; it would normally have a trailing
<TT>\n</TT> too, but doesn't have to.
</P>

<P class="docText">To help illustrate this point, this script binds the Escape key press
to fetch and print the entire contents of the <TT>Text</TT>
widget it embeds:
</P>

<PRE>C:\...\PP2E\Gui\Tour&gt;<B>python scrolledtext.py</B>
PP2E scrolledtext
'Words\012go here'
'Always look\012on the bright\012side of life\012'</PRE>

<P class="docText">When run with arguments, the script stores a file's contents in
the text widget. When run without arguments, the script stuffs a
simple literal string into the widget, displayed by the first Escape
press output here (recall that <TT>\012</TT> is the octal
escape form of the <TT>\n</TT> line terminator). The second
output here happens when pressing Escape in the shrunken window
captured in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-16">Figure 8-16</A>.
</P>

<H5 class="docFigureTitle"><A NAME="python2-CHP-8-FIG-16"></A>Figure 8-16. scrolledtext gets a positive outlook</H5>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-4.1.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.4.1.2 String positions</H5>

<P class="docText">The second key to understanding <TT>Text</TT> code has to
do with the ways you specify a position in the text string. Like the
listbox, text widgets allow you to specify such a position in a
variety of ways. In <TT>Text</TT>, methods that expect a
position to be passed in will accept an index, a mark, or a tag
reference. Moreover, some special operations are invoked with
predefined marks and tags -- the insert cursor is mark
<TT>INSERT</TT>, and the current selection is tag
<TT>SEL</TT>.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-4.1.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection4Title">8.4.1.2.1 Text indexes</H5>

<P class="docText">Because it is a multiple-line widget, <TT>Text</TT> indexes
identify both a line and a column. For instance, consider the
interfaces of the basic insert, delete, and fetch text operations
used by this script:
</P>

<PRE>self.text.insert('1.0', text)             # insert text at the start
self.text.delete('1.0', END)              # delete all current text
return self.text.get('1.0', END+'-1c')    # fetch first through last</PRE>

<P class="docText">In all of these, the first argument is an absolute index that refers
to the start of the text string: string "1.0" means row
1, column
(rows are numbered from 1 and columns from 0). An index
"2.1" refers to the second character in the second row.
</P>

<P class="docText">Like the listbox, text indexes can also be symbolic names: the
<TT>END</TT> in the preceding <TT>delete</TT>
call refers to the position just past the last character in the text
string (it's a Tkinter variable preset to string
"end"). Similarly, the symbolic index
<TT>INSERT</TT> (really, string "insert")
refers to the position immediately after the insert cursor -- the
place where characters would appear if typed at the keyboard.
Symbolic names like <TT>INSERT</TT> can also be called
marks, described in a moment.
</P>

<P class="docText">For added precision, you can add simple arithmetic extensions to
index strings. The index expression <TT>END+'-1c'</TT> in
the <TT>get</TT> call in the previous example, for
instance, is really the string "end-1c", and refers to
one character back from <TT>END</TT>. Because
<TT>END</TT> points to just beyond the last character in
the text string, this expression refers to the last character itself.
The <TT>-1c</TT> extension effectively strips the trailing
<TT>\n</TT> that this widget adds to its contents (and may
add a blank line if saved in a file).
</P>

<P class="docText">Similar index string extensions let you name characters ahead
(<TT>+1c</TT>), lines ahead and behind
(<TT>+2l</TT>, <TT>-2l</TT>), and specify things
like word and line starts around an index
(<TT>lineend</TT>, <TT>wordstart</TT>). Indexes
show up in most <TT>Text</TT> widget calls.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-4.1.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection4Title">8.4.1.2.2 Text marks</H5>

<P class="docText">Besides row/column identifier strings, you can also pass positions as
names of marks -- symbolic names for a position between two
characters. Unlike absolute row/column positions, marks are virtual
locations that move as new text is inserted or deleted (by your
script or your user). A mark always refers to its original location,
even if that location shifts to a different row and column over time.
</P>

<P class="docText">To create a mark, call the <TT>text</TT>
<TT>mark_set</TT> method with a string name and an index to
give its logical location. For instance, this script sets the insert
cursor at the start of the text initially, with a call like the first
one here:
</P>

<PRE>self.text.mark_set(INSERT, '1.0')             # set insert cursor to start
self.text.mark_set('linetwo', '2.0')          # mark current line 2</PRE>

<P class="docText">The name <TT>INSERT</TT> is a predefined special mark that
identifies the insert cursor position; setting it changes the insert
cursor's location. To make a mark of your own, simply provide a
unique name as in the second call here, and use it anywhere you need
to specify a text position. The <TT>mark_unset</TT> call
deletes marks by name.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-4.1.2.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection4Title">8.4.1.2.3 Text tags</H5>

<P class="docText">In addition to absolute indexes and symbolic mark names, the
<TT>Text</TT> widget supports the notion of
tags -- symbolic names associated with one or more substrings
within the <TT>Text</TT> widget's string. Tags can be
used for many things, but they also serve to represent a position
anywhere you need one: tagged items are named by their beginning and
ending indexes, which can be later passed to position-based calls.
</P>

<P class="docText">For example, Tkinter provides a built-in tag name
<TT>SEL</TT> -- a Tkinter name preassigned to string
"sel" -- which automatically refers to currently
selected text. To fetch the text selected (highlighted) with a mouse,
run either of these calls:
</P>

<PRE>text = self.text.get(SEL_FIRST, SEL_LAST)      # use tags for from/to indexes
text = self.text.get('sel.first', 'sel.last')  # strings and constants work </PRE>

<P class="docText">The names <TT>SEL_FIRST</TT> and
<TT>SEL_LAST</TT> are just preassigned variables in the
Tkinter module that refer to the strings used in the second line
here. The text <TT>get</TT> method expects two indexes; to
fetch text names by a tag, add <TT>.first</TT> and
<TT>.last</TT> to the tag's name to get its start and
end indexes.
</P>

<P class="docText">To tag a substring, call the text widget's
<TT>tag_add</TT> method with a tag name string and start
and stop positions (text can also be tagged as added in
<TT>insert</TT> calls). To remove a tag from all characters
in a range of text, call <TT>tag_remove</TT>:
</P>

<PRE>self.text.tag_add('alltext', '1.0', END)  # tag all text in the widget
self.text.tag_add(SEL, index1, index2)    # select from index1 up to index2
self.text.tag_remove(SEL, '1.0', END)     # remove selection from all text</PRE>

<P class="docText">The first line here creates a new tag that names all text in the
widget -- from start through end positions. The second line adds a
range of characters to the built-in <TT>SEL</TT> selection
tag -- they are automatically highlighted, because this tag is
predefined to configure its members that way. The third line removes
all characters in the text string from the <TT>SEL</TT> tag
(all selections are unselected). Note that the
<TT>tag_remove</TT> call just untags text within the named
range; to really delete a tag completely, call
<TT>tag_delete</TT> instead.
</P>

<P class="docText">You can map indexes to tags dynamically too. For example, the text
<TT>search</TT> method returns the
<TT>row.column</TT> index of the first occurrence of a
string between start and stop positions. To automatically select the
text thus found, simply add its index to the built-in
<TT>SEL</TT> tag:
</P>

<PRE>where = self.text.search(target, INSERT, END)  # search from insert cursor
pastit = where + ('+%dc' % len(target))        # index beyond string found
self.text.tag_add(SEL, where, pastit)          # tag and select found string
self.text.focus()                              # select text widget itself</PRE>

<P class="docText">If you only want one string to be selected, be sure to first run the
<TT>tag_remove</TT> call listed earlier -- this code
adds a selection in addition to any selections that already exist (it
may generate multiple selections in the display). In general, you can
add any number of substrings to a tag to process them as a group.
</P>

<P class="docText">To summarize: indexes, marks, and tag locations can be used anytime
you need a text position. For instance, the text
<TT>see</TT> method scrolls the display to make a position
visible; it accepts all three kinds of position specifiers:
</P>

<PRE>self.text.see('1.0')          # scroll display to top
self.text.see(INSERT)         # scroll display to insert cursor mark
self.text.see(SEL_FIRST)      # scroll display to selection tag</PRE>

<P class="docText">Text tags can also be used in broader ways for formatting and event
bindings, but I'll defer those details until the end of this
section.

standalone, it brings up the window in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-17">Figure 8-17</A>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.4.2.1 Using the clipboard</H5>

<P class="docText">Besides text widget operations, <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-11">Example 8-11</A> applies
the Tkinter clipboard interfaces in its cut and paste functions.
Together, these operations allow you to move text within a file (cut
in one place, paste in another). The clipboard they use is just a
place to store data temporarily -- deleted text is placed on the
clipboard on a cut, and text is inserted from the clipboard on a
paste. If we restrict our focus to this program alone, there really
is no reason that the text string cut couldn't simply be stored
in a Python instance variable. But the clipboard is actually a much
larger concept.
</P>

<P class="docText">The clipboard used by this script is an interface to a systemwide
storage space, shared by all programs on your computer. Because of
that, it can be used to transfer data between applications, even ones
that know nothing of Tkinter. For instance, text cut or copied in a
Microsoft Word session can be pasted in a
<TT>SimpleEditor</TT> window, and text cut in
<TT>SimpleEditor</TT> can be pasted in a Microsoft Notepad
window (try it). By using the clipboard for cut and paste,
<TT>SimpleEditor</TT> automatically integrates with the
window system at large. Moreover, the clipboard is not just for the
text widget -- it can also be used to cut and paste graphical
objects in the <TT>Canvas</TT> widget (discussed next).
</P>

<P class="docText">As used in this script, the basic Tkinter clipboard interface looks
like this:
</P>

<PRE>self.clipboard_clear()                            # clear the clipboard
self.clipboard_append(text)                       # store a text string on it
text = self.selection_get(selection='CLIPBOARD')  # fetch contents, if any</PRE>

<P class="docText">All of these calls are available as methods inherited by all Tkinter
widget objects because they are global in nature. The
<TT>CLIPBOARD</TT> selection used by this script is
available on all platforms (a <TT>PRIMARY</TT> selection is
also available, but is only generally useful on X Windows, so
we'll ignore it here). Notice that the clipboard
<TT>selection_get</TT> call throws a
<TT>TclError</TT> exception if it fails; this script simply
ignores it and abandons a paste request, but we'll do better
later.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-4.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.4.2.2 Composition versus inheritance</H5>

<P class="docText">As coded, <TT>SimpleEditor</TT> uses inheritance to extend
<TT>ScrolledText</TT> with extra buttons and callback
methods. As we've seen, it's also reasonable to attach
(embed) GUI objects coded as components, like
<TT>ScrolledText</TT>. The attachment model is usually
called composition; some people find it simpler to understand, and
less prone to name clashes than extension by inheritance.
</P>

<P class="docText">To give you an idea of the differences between these two approaches,
the following sketches the sort of code you would write to attach a
<TT>ScrolledText</TT> to <TT>SimpleEditor</TT>
with changed lines in bold font (see file
<I>simpleedit-2.py</I> on the CD for a complete
composition implementation). It's mostly a matter of passing in
the right parents, and adding an extra "st" attribute
name to get to the <TT>Text</TT> widget's methods:
</P>

<PRE><B>class SimpleEditor(Frame): </B>
    def __init__(self, parent=None, file=None):
        Frame.__init__(self, parent)
        self.pack()
        frm = Frame(self)
        frm.pack(fill=X)
        Button(frm, text='Save',  command=self.onSave).pack(side=LEFT)
<I>                ...more...</I>
        Quitter(frm).pack(side=LEFT)
        <B>self.st = ScrolledText(self, file=file)   </B>         # attach, not subclass
<B>        self.st.text.config(font=('courier', 9, 'normal')) </B>
    def onSave(self):
        filename = asksaveasfilename()
        if filename:
            <B>alltext = self.st.gettext()       </B>             # go through attribute
            open(filename, 'w').write(alltext)
    def onCut(self):
<B>        text = self.st.text.get(SEL_FIRST, SEL_LAST) </B>
<B>        self.st.text.delete(SEL_FIRST, SEL_LAST) </B>
<I>                ...more...</I></PRE>

<P class="docText">The window looks identical when such code is run. I'll let you
be the judge of whether composition or inheritance is better here. If
you code your Python GUI classes right, they will work under either
regime.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-4.2.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.4.2.3 It's called "Simple" for a reason</H5>

<P class="docText">Finally, before you change your system registry to make
<TT>SimpleEditor</TT> your default text file viewer, I
should mention that although it shows the basics, it's
something of a stripped-down version of the PyEdit example
we'll meet in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-9.html#python2-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>. In fact, you should
study that example now if you're looking for more complete
Tkinter text processing code in general. Because the text widget is
so powerful, it's difficult to demonstrate more of its features
without the volume of code that is already listed in the PyEdit
program.
</P>

<P class="docText">I should also point out that <TT>SimpleEditor</TT> is not
only limited in function, it's just plain careless -- many
boundary cases go unchecked and trigger uncaught exceptions that
don't kill the GUI, but are not handled or reported. Even
errors that are caught are not reported to the user (e.g., a paste,
with nothing to be pasted). Be sure to see the PyEdit example for a
more robust and complete implementation of the operations introduced
in <TT>SimpleEditor</TT>.<A NAME="IXTR3-81"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-82"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-83"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-84"></A>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.4.3 Advanced Text and Tag Operations</H4>

<P class="docText">Besides position specifiers, text tags can also be used to apply
formatting and behavior to both all characters in a substring, and
all substrings added to a tag. In fact, this is where much of the
power of the text widget lies:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">Tags have formatting attributes for setting color, font, tabs, and
line spacing and justification; to apply these to many parts of the
text at once, associate them with a tag and apply formatting to the
tag with the <TT>tag_config</TT> method, much like the
general widget <TT>config</TT> we've been using.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Tags can also have associated event bindings, which lets you
implement things like hyperlinks in a <TT>Text</TT> widget:
clicking the text triggers its tag's event handler. Tag
bindings are set with a <TT>tag_bind</TT> method, much like
the general widget <TT>bind</TT> method we've already
met.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">With tags, it's possible to display multiple configurations
within the same text widget; for instance, you can apply one font to
the text widget at large, and other fonts to tagged text. In
addition, the text widget allows you to embed other widgets at an
index (they are treated like a single character), as well as images.
</P>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-12">Example 8-12</A> illustrates the basics of all these
advanced tools at once, and draws the interface captured in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-20">Figure 8-20</A>. This script applies formatting and event
bindings to three tagged substrings, displays text in two different
font and color schemes, and embeds an image and a button.
Double-clicking any of the tagged substrings (or the embedded button)
with a mouse triggers an event that prints a "Got tag
event" message to <TT>stdout</TT>.

<P class="docText">Such embedding and tag tools could ultimately be used to render a web
page. In fact, Python's standard <TT>htmllib</TT>
HTML parser module can help automate web page GUI construction. As
you can probably tell, though, the text widget offers more GUI
programming options than we have space to list here. For more details
on tag and text options, consult other Tk and Tkinter references.
