<TT>Canvas</TT> widget is the most free-form device in the
library. It's a place to draw shapes, move objects dynamically,
and place other kinds of widgets. The canvas is based on a structured
graphic object model: everything drawn on a canvas can be processed
as an object. You can get down to the pixel-by-pixel level in a
canvas, but you can also deal in terms of larger objects like shapes,
photos, and embedded widgets.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.5.2 Programming the Canvas Widget</H4>

<P class="docText">Canvases are easy to use, but rely on a coordinate system, define
unique drawing methods, and name objects by identifier or tag. This
section introduces these core canvas concepts.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-5.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.5.2.1 Coordinates</H5>

<P class="docText">All items drawn on a canvas are distinct objects, but they are not
really widgets. If you study the <TT>canvas1</TT> script
closely, you'll notice that canvases are created and packed (or
gridded or placed) within their parent container just like any other
widget in Tkinter. But the items drawn on a canvas are
not -- shapes, images, and so on are positioned and moved on the
canvas by coordinates, identifiers, and tags. Of these, coordinates
are the most fundamental part of the canvas model.
</P>

<P class="docText">Canvases define an (X,Y) coordinate system for their drawing area; X
means the horizontal scale, Y means vertical. By default, coordinates
are measured in screen pixels (dots), the upper-left corner of the
canvas has coordinates (0,0), and X and Y coordinates increase to the
right and down, respectively. To draw and embed objects within a
canvas, you supply one or more (X,Y) coordinate pairs to give
absolute canvas locations. This is different than the constraints
we've used to pack widgets thus far, but allows very
fine-grained control over graphical layouts, and supports more
freeform interface techniques such as animation.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[2]</A></sup>
</P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[2]</A></sup> Animation techniques are covered at the end of this tour.
Because you can embed other widgets in a canvas's drawing area,
their coordinate system also makes them ideal for implementing GUIs
that let users design other GUIs by dragging embedded widgets around
on the canvas -- a useful canvas application we would explore in
this book if I had a few hundred pages to spare.</p></blockquote>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-5.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.5.2.2 Object construction</H5>

<P class="docText">The canvas allows you to draw and display common shapes like lines,
ovals, rectangles, arcs, and polygons. In addition, you can embed
text, images, and other kinds of Tkinter widgets such as labels and
buttons. The <TT>canvas1</TT> script demonstrates all the
basic graphic object constructor calls; to each, you pass one or more
sets of (X,Y) coordinates to give the new object's location,
start and end points, or diagonally opposite corners of a bounding
box that encloses the shape:
</P>

<PRE>id = canvas.create_line(fromX, fromY, toX, toY)       # line start, stop
id = canvas.create_oval(fromX, fromY, toX, toY)       # two opposite box corners
id = canvas.create_arc( fromX, fromY, toX, toY)       # two opposite oval corners
id = canvas.create_rectangle(fromX, fromY, toX, toY)  # two opposite corners</PRE>

<P class="docText">Other drawing calls specify just one (X,Y) pair, to give the location
of the object's upper-left corner:
</P>

<PRE>id = canvas.create_image(250, 0, image=photo, anchor=NW)  # embed a photo
id = canvas.create_window(100, 100, window=widget)        # embed a widget
id = canvas.create_text(100, 280, text='Ham')             # draw some text</PRE>

<P class="docText">The canvas also provides a <TT>create_polygon</TT> method
that accepts an arbitrary set of coordinate arguments defining the
end-points of connected lines; it's useful for drawing more
arbitrary kinds of shapes composed of straight lines.
</P>

<P class="docText">In addition to coordinates, most of these drawing calls let you
specify common configuration options, such as outline
<TT>width</TT>, <TT>fill</TT> color,
<TT>outline</TT> color, and so on. Individual object types
have unique configuration options all their own too; for instance,
lines may specify the shape of an optional arrow, and text, widgets,
and images may all be anchored to a point of the compass (this looks
like the packer's <TT>anchor</TT>, but really gives a
point on the object that is positioned at the (X,Y) coordinates given
in the create call; <TT>NW</TT> puts the upper-left corner
at (X,Y)).
</P>

<P class="docText">Perhaps the most important thing to notice here, though, is that
Tkinter does most of the "grunt" work for you -- when
drawing graphics, you provide coordinates, and shapes are
automatically plotted and rendered in the pixel world. If
you've ever done any lower-level graphics work, you'll
appreciate the difference.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-5.2.3"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.5.2.3 Object identifiers and operations</H5>

<P class="docText">Although not used by the <TT>canvas1</TT> script, every
object you put on a canvas has an identifier, returned by the
<TT>create_</TT> method that draws or embeds the object
(what was coded as "id" in the last section's
examples). This identifier can later be passed to other methods that
move the object to new coordinates, set its configuration options,
delete it from the canvas, raise or lower it among other overlapping
objects, and so on.
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, the canvas <TT>move</TT> method accepts both
an object identifier and X and Y offsets (not coordinates), and moves
the named object by the offsets given:
</P>

<PRE>canvas.move(objectIdOrTag, offsetX, offsetY)    # move object(s) by offset</PRE>

<P class="docText">If this happens to move the object offscreen, it is simply clipped
(not shown). Other common canvas operations process objects too:
</P>

<PRE>canvas.delete(objectIdOrTag)                   # delete object(s) from canvas
canvas.tkraise(objectIdOrTag)                  # raise object(s) to front
canvas.lower(objectIdOrTag)                    # lower object(s) below others
canvas.itemconfig(objectIdOrTag, fill='red')   # fill object(s) with red color</PRE>

<P class="docText">Notice the <TT>tkraise</TT>
name -- <TT>raise</TT> by itself is a reserved word in
Python. Also note that the <TT>itemconfig</TT> method is
used to configure objects drawn on a canvas after they have been
created; use <TT>config</TT> to set configuration options
for the canvas itself. The best thing to notice here, though, is that
because Tkinter is based on structured objects, you can process a
graphic object all at once; there is no need to erase and redraw each
pixel manually to implement a move or raise.
</P>



<A NAME="python2-CHP-8-SECT-5.2.4"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.5.2.4 Canvas object tags</H5>

<P class="docText">But it gets even better: In addition to object identifiers, you can
also perform canvas operations on entire sets of objects at once, by
associating them all with a <span class="docEmphasis">tag</span> , a name that
you make up and apply to objects on the display. Tagging objects in a
<TT>Canvas</TT> is at least similar in spirit to tagging
substrings in the <TT>Text</TT> widget we studied in the
prior section. In general terms, canvas operation methods accept
either a single object's identifier or a tag name.
</P>

<P class="docText">For example, you can move an entire set of drawn objects by
associating all with the same tag, and passing the tag name to the
canvas <TT>move</TT> method. In fact, this is why
<TT>move</TT> takes offsets, not coordinates -- when
given a tag, each object associated with the tag is moved by the same
(X,Y) offsets; absolute coordinates would make all the tagged objects
appear on top of each other instead.
</P>

<P class="docText">To associate an object with a tag, either specify the tag name in the
object drawing call's <TT>tag</TT> option, or call
the <TT>addtag_withtag(tag, objectIdOrTag)</TT> canvas
method (or its relatives). For instance:
</P>

<PRE>canvas.create_oval(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill='red', tag='bubbles')
canvas.create_oval(x3, y3, x4, y4, fill='red', tag='bubbles')
objectId = canvas.create_oval(x5, y5, x6, y6, fill='red')
canvas.addtag_withtag('bubbles', objectId)
canvas.move('bubbles', diffx, diffy)</PRE>

<P class="docText">This makes three ovals and moves them at the same time by associating
them all with the same tag name. Many objects can have the same tag,
many tags can refer to the same object, and each tag can be
individually configured and processed.
</P>

<P class="docText">As in <TT>Text</TT>, <TT>Canvas</TT> widgets have
predefined tag names too: tag "all" refers to all objects
on the canvas, and "current" refers to whatever object is
under the mouse cursor. Besides asking for an object under the mouse,
you can also search for objects with the <TT>find_</TT>
canvas methods: <TT>canvas.find_closest(X,Y)</TT>, for
instance, returns a tuple whose first item is the identifier of the
closest object to the supplied coordinates -- handy after
you've received coordinates in a general mouseclick event
callback.
</P>

<P class="docText">We'll revisit the notion of canvas tags by example later in
this chapter (see the animation scripts near the end if you
can't wait). Canvases support additional operations and options
that we don't have space to cover here (e.g., the canvas
<TT>postscript</TT> method lets you save the canvas in a
postscript file). See later examples in this book such as PyDraw for
more details, and consult other Tk or Tkinter references for an
exhaustive list of canvas object options.

<IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="184" src="FILES/ppy2_0822.gif" ALT="figs/ppy2_0822.gif"></CENTER>

<P class="docText">Sizes are given as configuration options. To specify a view area
size, use canvas <TT>width</TT> and
<TT>height</TT> options. To specify an overall canvas size,
give the (X,Y) coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners
of the canvas in a four-item tuple passed to the
<TT>scrollregion</TT> option. If no view area size is
given, a default size is used. If no <TT>scrollregion</TT>
is given, it defaults to the view area size; this makes the scrollbar
useless, since the view is assumed to hold the entire canvas.
</P>

<P class="docText">Mapping coordinates is a bit more subtle. If the scrollable view area
associated with a canvas is smaller than the canvas at large, then
the (X,Y) coordinates returned in event objects are view area
coordinates, not overall canvas coordinates. You'll generally
want to scale the event coordinates to canvas coordinates, by passing
them to the <TT>canvasx</TT> and <TT>canvasy</TT>
canvas methods before using them to process objects.
</P>

event coordinates are always relative to the displayed view window,
not the overall canvas:

<P class="docText">Here, the mapped canvas X is always the same as the canvas X because
the display area and canvas are both set at 300 pixels wide (it would
be off by two pixels due to automatic borders if not for the
script's <TT>highlightthickness</TT> setting). But
notice that the mapped Y is wildly different from the event Y if you
click after a vertical scroll. Without scaling, the event's Y
incorrectly points to a spot much higher in the canvas.
</P>

<P class="docText">Most of this book's canvas examples need no such
scaling -- (0,0) always maps to the upper-left corner of the
canvas display in which a mouseclick occurs -- but just because
canvases are not scrolled. But see the PyTree program later in this
book for an example of a canvas with both horizontal and vertical
scrolls, and dynamically changed scroll region sizes.
</P>

<P class="docText">As a rule of thumb, if your canvases scroll, be sure to scale event
coordinates to true canvas coordinates in callback handlers that care
about positions. Some handlers might not care if events are bound to
individual drawn objects instead of the canvas at large; but we need
to talk more about events to see why.<A NAME="IXTR3-89"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-90"></A>

<P class="docText">This script intercepts and processes three mouse-controlled actions:</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Clearing the canvas</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">To erase everything on the canvas, the script binds the double
left-click event to run the canvas's <TT>delete</TT>
method with tag "all" -- again, a built-in tag that
associates every object on the screen. Notice that the canvas widget
clicked is available in the event object passed in to the callback
handler (it's also available as
<TT>self.canvas</TT>).
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Dragging out object shapes</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Pressing the left mouse button and dragging (moving it while the
button is still pressed) creates a rectangle or oval shape as you
drag. This is often called dragging out an object -- the shape
grows and shrinks in an elastic, rubber-band fashion as you drag the
mouse, and winds up with a final size and location given by the point
where you release the mouse button.
</P>

<P class="docList">To make this work in Tkinter, all you need to do is delete the old
shape and draw another as each drag event fires; both delete and draw
operations are fast enough to achieve the elastic drag-out effect. Of
course, to draw a shape to the current mouse location you need a
starting point; and to delete before a redraw you also must remember
the last drawn object's identifier. Two events come into play:
the initial button press event saves the start coordinates (really,
the initial press event object, which contains the start
coordinates), and mouse movement events erase and redraw from the
start coordinates to the new mouse coordinates, and save the new
object ID for the next event's erase.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Object moves</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">When you click the right mouse button (button 3), the script moves
the most recently drawn object to the spot you clicked in a single
step. The event argument gives the (X,Y) coordinates of the spot
clicked, and we subtract the saved starting coordinates of the last
drawn object to get the (X,Y) offsets to pass to the canvas move
method (again, move does not take positions). Remember to scale event
coordinates first if your canvas is scrolled.
</P>
</DD>

<P class="docText">The net result creates a window like that shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-23">Figure 8-23</A> after user interaction. As you drag out
objects, the script alternates between ovals and rectangles; set the
script's <TT>trace</TT> global to watch object
identifiers scroll on <TT>stdout</TT> as new objects are
drawn during a drag. This screen shot was taken after a few object
drag-outs and moves, but you'd never tell from looking at it;
run this example on your own computer to get a better feel for the
operations it supports.

<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.5.4.1 Binding events on specific items</H5>

<P class="docText">Much like we did for the <TT>Text</TT> widget, it is also
possible to bind events for one or more specific objects drawn on a
<TT>Canvas</TT> with its <TT>tag_bind</TT>
method. This call accepts either a tag name string or object ID in
its first argument. For instance, you can register a different
callback handler for mouseclicks on every drawn item, or on any in a
group of drawn and tagged items, rather than for the entire canvas at
large. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-16">Example 8-16</A> binds a double-click handler in
both the canvas itself and on two specific text items within it, to
illustrate the interfaces; it generates <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-24">Figure 8-24</A>
when run.

<P class="docText">Object IDs are passed to <TT>tag_bind</TT> here, but a tag
name string would work too. When you click outside the text items in
this script's window, the canvas event handler fires; when
either text item is clicked, both the canvas and text object handlers
fire. Here is the <TT>stdout</TT> result after clicking on
the canvas twice and on each text item once; the script uses the
canvas <TT>find_closest</TT> method to fetch the object ID
of the particular text item clicked (the one closest to the click
spot):

<P class="docText">We'll revisit the notion of events bound to canvases in the
PyDraw example in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-9.html#python2-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>, where we'll use
them to implement a feature-rich paint and motion program.
We'll also return to the <TT>canvasDraw</TT> script
later in this chapter, to add tag-based moves and simple animation
with time-based tools, so keep this page bookmarked for reference.
First, though, let's follow a promising side road to explore
another way to lay out widgets within windows.<A NAME="IXTR3-91"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-92"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-93"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-94"></A>
