<A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-272"></A>So far,
we've been arranging widgets in displays by calling their
<TT>pack</TT> methods -- an interface to the packer
geometry manager in Tkinter. This section introduces
<TT>grid</TT>, the most commonly used alternative to the
packer.
</P>

<P class="docText">As we learned earlier, Tkinter geometry managers work by arranging
child widgets within a parent container widget (parents are typically
<TT>Frames</TT> or top-level windows). When we ask a widget
to pack or grid itself, we're really asking its parent to place
it among its siblings. With <TT>pack</TT>, we provide
constraints and let the geometry manager lay out widgets
appropriately. With <TT>grid</TT>, we arrange widgets in
rows and columns in their parent, as though the parent container
widget was a table.
</P>

<P class="docText">Gridding is an entirely distinct geometry management system in
Tkinter. In fact, at this writing <TT>pack</TT> and
<TT>grid</TT> are mutually exclusive for widgets that have
the same parent -- within a given parent container, we can either
pack widgets or grid them, but not both. That makes sense, if you
realize that geometry managers do their jobs at parents, and a widget
can only be arranged by one geometry manager.
</P>

<P class="docText">At least within one container, though, that means that you must pick
either <TT>grid</TT> or <TT>pack</TT> and stick
with it. So why grid, then? In general, <TT>grid</TT> is
handy for laying out form-like displays; arranging input fields in
row/column fashion can be at least as easy as laying out the display
with nested frames. As we'll see, though,
<TT>grid</TT> doesn't offer substantial code or
complexity savings compared to equivalent packer solutions in
practice, especially when things like resizability are added to the
GUI picture. In other words, the choice between the two layout
schemes is largely one of style, not technology.

<P class="docText">Now that I've shown you what these windows do, I need to
explain how they do it. We learned earlier how to make widgets expand
with <TT>pack</TT>: we use <TT>expand</TT> and
<TT>fill</TT> options to increase space allocations and
stretch into them. To make expansion work for widgets arranged by
<TT>grid</TT>, we need to use different protocols: rows and
columns must be marked with a weight to make them expandable, and
widgets must also be made sticky so that they are stretched within
their allocated grid cell:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Heavy rows and columns</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">With <TT>pack</TT>, we make each row expandable by making
the corresponding <TT>Frame</TT> expandable, with
<TT>expand=YES</TT> and <TT>fill=BOTH</TT>.
Gridders must be a bit more specific: to get full expandability, call
the grid container's <TT>rowconfig</TT> method for
each row, and its <TT>columnconfig</TT> for each column. To
both methods, pass a weight option with a value greater than zero to
enable rows and columns to expand. Weight defaults to zero (which
means no expansion), and the grid container in this script is just
the top-level window. Using different weights for different rows and
columns makes them grow at proportionally different rates.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Sticky widgets</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">With <TT>pack</TT>, we use <TT>fill</TT> options
to stretch widgets to fill their allocated space horizontally or
vertically, and <TT>anchor</TT> options to position widgets
within their allocated space. With <TT>grid</TT> , the
<TT>sticky</TT> option serves the roles of both
<TT>fill</TT> and <TT>anchor</TT> in the packer.
Gridded widgets can optionally be made sticky on one side of their
allocated cell space (like <TT>anchor</TT>) or more than
one side to make them stretch (like <TT>fill</TT>). Widgets
can be made sticky in four directions -- <TT>N</TT>,
<TT>S</TT>, <TT>E</TT>, and <TT>W</TT>,
and concatenations of these letters specify multiple-side stickiness.
For instance, a sticky setting of <TT>W</TT> left-justifies
the widget in its allocated space (like a packer
<TT>anchor=W</TT>), and <TT>NS</TT> stretches the
widget vertically within its allocated space (like a packer
<TT>fill=Y</TT>).
</P>

<P class="docList">Widget stickiness hasn't been useful in examples thus far
because the layouts were regularly sized (widgets were no smaller
than their allocated grid cell space), and resizes weren't
supported at all. Here, this script specifies <TT>NSEW</TT>
stickiness to make widgets stretch in all directions with their
allocated cells.
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">Different combinations of row and column weights and sticky settings
generate different resize effects. For instance, deleting the
<TT>columnconfig</TT> lines in the <TT>grid3</TT>
script makes the display expand vertically but not horizontally. Try
changing some of these settings yourself to see the sorts of effects
they produce.

<A NAME="IXT-8-337034"></A> <A NAME="IXT-8-337035"></A> <A NAME="IXT-8-337036"></A>There is one other big difference in
how the <TT>grid3</TT> script configures its windows. Both
the <TT>grid</TT> and <TT>pack</TT> windows
display a label on the top that spans the entire window. For the
packer scheme, we simply make a label attached to the top of the
window at large (remember, <TT>side</TT> defaults to
<TT>TOP</TT>):
</P>

<PRE>Label(root, text='Pack').pack()</PRE>

<P class="docText">Because this label is attached to the window's top before any
row frames are, it appears across the entire window top as expected.
But laying out such a label takes a bit more work in the rigid world
of grids; the first line of the grid implementation function does it
like this:
</P>

<PRE>Label(root, text='Grid').grid(<B>columnspan=2</B>)</PRE>

<P class="docText">To make a widget span across multiple columns, we pass grid a
<TT>columnspan</TT> option with spanned-column count. Here,
it just specifies that the label at the top of the window should
stretch over the entire window -- across both the label and entry
columns. To make a widget span across multiple rows, pass a
<TT>rowspan</TT> option instead. The regular layouts of
grids can be either an asset or a liability, depending on how regular
your user interface will be; these two span settings let you specify
exceptions to the rule when needed.
</P>

<P class="docText">So which geometry manager comes out on top here? When resizing is
factored in, as in this script, gridding actually becomes slightly
more complex (in fact, gridding requires three extra lines of code
here). On the other hand, <TT>grid</TT> is nice for simple

<P class="docText">Notice that this module's <TT>SumGrid</TT> class is
careful not to either grid or pack itself. In order to be attachable
to containers where other widgets are being gridded or packed, it
leaves its own geometry management ambiguous, and requires callers to
pack or grid its instances. It's okay for containers to pick
either scheme for their own children, because they effectively seal
off the pack-or-grid choice. But attachable component classes that
aim to be reused under both geometry managers cannot manage
themselves, because they cannot predict their parent's policy.

<P class="docText">This is a fairly long example that doesn't say much else about

dimensions, but contains expressions in two of its columns, not just
simple numbers. Because this script converts input field values with
the Python <TT>eval</TT> built-in function, any Python

<P class="docText">Summing these fields runs the Python code they contain, as seen in
<A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-36">Figure 8-36</A>. This can be a powerful feature; imagine
a full-blown spreadsheet grid, for instance -- field values could
be Python code "snippets" that compute values on the fly,
call functions in modules, even download current stock quotes over
the Internet with tools we'll meet in the next part of this
book.
</P>

<P class="docText">It's also a potential dangerous tool -- a field might just
contain an expression that erases your hard drive! If you're
not sure what expressions may do, either don't use
<TT>eval</TT> (convert with more limited built-in functions
like <TT>int</TT> and <TT>float</TT> instead), or
see <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-15.html#python2-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A> for details on the Python
<TT>rexec</TT> restricted-execution mode module.

<P class="docText">Of course, this still is nowhere near a true spreadsheet program;
further mutations towards that goal are left as exercises. I should
also point out that there is more to gridding than we have time to
present fully here. For instance, by creating subframes that have
grids of their own, we can build up more sophisticated layouts in
much the same way as nested frames arranged with the packer. For now,
let's move on to one last widget survey topic.<A NAME="IXTR3-97"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-98"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-99"></A> <A NAME="IXTR3-100"></A>
