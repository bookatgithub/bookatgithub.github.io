<P class="docText">The last stop on our widget tour is the most unique. Tkinter also
comes with a handful of tools that have to do with the event-driven
programming model, not graphics displayed on a computer screen.

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-8-337037"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-337038"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-337039"></A>Some GUI applications need to
perform background activities periodically. For example, to
"blink" a widget's appearance, we'd like to
register a callback handler to be invoked at regular time intervals.
Similarly, it's not a good idea to let a long-running file
operation block other activity in a GUI; if the event loop could be
forced to update periodically, the GUI could remain responsive.
Tkinter comes with tools for both scheduling such delayed actions and
forcing screen updates:

object: a function, bound method, etc. This form of the call does not
pause the program -- the callback function is run later from the
normal Tkinter event loop. The milliseconds value can be a floating

callback. Since this method is so commonly used, I'll say more

You can call this periodically from a long-running callback handler
to refresh the screen and perform any updates to it that your handler
has already requested. If you don't, your updates may not
appear on screen until your callback handler exits. In fact, your
display may hang completely during long-running handlers if not
manually updated (and handlers are not run in threads, as described
in the next section); the window won't even redraw itself until
the handler returns if covered and uncovered by another. For
instance, programs that animate by repeatedly moving an object and
pausing must call for an update before the end of the animation, or
only the final object position will appear on screen; worse, the GUI
will be completely inactive until the animation callback returns (see
the simple animation examples later in this chapter, and PyDraw in

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.7.1 Using Threads with GUIs</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="IXT-8-337042"></A>
<A NAME="IXT-8-337043"></A>Keep in mind that for many programs,
Python's thread support that we met in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-3.html#python2-CHP-3">Chapter 3</A>, can serve some of the same roles as the
Tkinter tools listed in the previous section. For instance, to avoid
blocking a GUI during a long-running file or socket transfer, the
transfer can simply be run in a spawned thread, while the rest of the
program continues to run normally. We'll meet such threaded GUI
programs in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-PART-III.html#python2-PART-III">Part III</A> (e.g., PyMailGui in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-11.html#python2-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A>). Similarly, GUIs that must watch for inputs
on pipes or sockets can do so in spawned threads (or
<TT>after</TT> callbacks), without blocking the GUI itself.
</P>

<P class="docText">If you do use threads in Tkinter programs, however, only the main
thread (the one that built the GUI and started the
<TT>mainloop</TT>) can make GUI calls. Even things like the
<TT>update</TT> method described in the previous section
cannot be called from spawned threads in a GUI
program -- they'll likely trigger very strange program
crashes. This GUI thread story may be improved in future Python and
Tkinter releases, but imposes a few structural and platform-specific
constraints today.
</P>

<P class="docText">For example, because spawned threads cannot perform GUI processing,
they must generally communicate with the main thread using global
variables, as required by the application. A thread that watches a
socket, for instance, might simply set global variables that trigger
GUI changes in <TT>after</TT> event callbacks. Note that
this is not a Python or Tkinter limitation (it's much lower in
the software hierarchy that runs your GUI), and may go away in the
future. In addition, some Tkinter canvas calls may actually be
thread-safe (see the animation script in <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-31">Example 8-31</A>). We'll revisit this limitation later in
this book, when we meet larger threaded GUI programs.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.7.2 Using the after Method</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-290"></A>The <TT>after</TT> method
allows scripts to schedule a callback handler to be run at some time
in the future, and we'll use this often in later examples in
this book. For instance, in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-9.html#python2-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A> we'll
meet a clock program that uses <TT>after</TT> to wake up 10
times per second and check for a new time, and an image slideshow
program that uses <TT>after</TT> to schedule the next photo
display (see PyClock and PyView). To illustrate the basics of
scheduled callbacks, <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-26">Example 8-26</A> does something a

periodically calls both the button widget's
<TT>flash</TT> method to make the button flash momentarily
(it alternates colors quickly), and the Tkinter
<TT>bell</TT> method to call your system's sound
interface. The <TT>repeater</TT> method beeps and flashes
once, and schedules a callback to be invoked after a specific amount
of time with the <TT>after</TT> method.

<P class="docText">But <TT>after</TT> doesn't pause the caller:
callbacks are scheduled to occur in the background, while the program
performs other processing -- technically, as soon as the Tk event
loop is able to notice the time rollover. To make this work,
<TT>repeater</TT> calls <TT>after</TT> each time
through, to reschedule the callback. Delayed events are one-shot
callbacks; to repeat the event, we need to reschedule.
</P>

<P class="docText">The net effect is that when this script runs, it starts beeping and
flashing once its one-button window pops up. And it keeps beeping and
flashing. And beeping. And flashing. Other activities and GUI
operations don't affect it. Even if the window is iconified,
the beeping continues because Tkinter timer events fire in the
background. You need to kill the window or press the button to stop
the alarm. By changing the <TT>msecs</TT> delay, you can
make this beep as fast or slow as your system allows (some platforms
can't beep as fast as others). And this may or may not be the
best demo to launch in a crowded office, but at least you've
been warned.

<P class="docText">When this script is run, the same window appears, but the button is
erased or redrawn on alternating timer events. The widget
<TT>pack_forget</TT> method erases (unmaps) a drawn widget,
and <TT>pack</TT> makes it show up again;
<TT>grid_forget</TT> and <TT>grid</TT> similarly
hide and show widgets in a grid. The <TT>pack_forget</TT>
method is useful for dynamically drawing and changing a running GUI.
For instance, you can be selective about which components are
displayed, and build widgets ahead of time and show them only as
needed. Here, it just means that users must press the button while
it's displayed, or else the noise keeps going.

(use <TT>iconify</TT> if you want the window's icon
to appear during a hide), and the <TT>state</TT> method
returns the window's current state ("normal",
"iconic", or "withdrawn"). These are also
useful to pop up prebuilt dialog windows dynamically, but are perhaps
less practical here.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.7.3 Simple Animation Techniques</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-292"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-293"></A> <A NAME="python2-IDXTERM-294"></A>Apart from the direct shape moves
in the <TT>canvasDraw</TT> example, all of the GUIs
presented so far in this part of the book have been fairly static.
This last section shows you how to change that, by adding simple
shape movement animations to the canvas drawing example listed in
<A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-8-SECT-5.html#python2-CHP-8-EX-15">Example 8-15</A>. It also demonstrates the notion of
canvas tags -- the move operations performed here move all canvas
objects associated with a tag at once. All oval shapes move if you
press "o", and all rectangles move if you press
"r"; as mentioned earlier, canvas operation methods
accept both object IDs and tag names.
</P>

<P class="docText">But the main goal here is to illustrate simple animation techniques
using the time-based tools described earlier in this section. There
are three basic ways to move objects around a canvas:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">By loops that use <TT>time.sleep</TT> to pause for
fractions of a second between multiple move operations, along with
manual <TT>update</TT> calls. The script moves, sleeps,
moves a bit more, and so on. A <TT>time.sleep</TT> call
pauses the caller, and so fails to return control to the GUI event
loop -- any new requests that arrive during a move are deferred.
Because of that, <TT>canvas.update</TT> must be called to
redraw the screen after each move, or else updates don't appear
until the entire movement loop callback finishes and returns. This is
a classic long-running callback scenario; without manual update
calls, no new GUI events are handled until the callback returns in
this scheme (even window redraws).
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">By using the <TT>widget.after</TT> method to schedule
multiple move operations to occur every few milliseconds. Because
this approach is based upon scheduled events dispatched by Tkinter to
your handlers, it allows multiple moves to occur in parallel, and
doesn't require <TT>canvas.update</TT> calls. You
rely on the event loop to run moves, so there's no reason for
sleep pauses, and the GUI is not blocked while moves are in progress.
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">By using threads to run multiple copies of the
<TT>time.sleep</TT> pausing loops of the first approach.
Because threads run in parallel, a sleep in any thread blocks neither
the GUI nor other motion threads. GUIs should not be updated from
spawned threads in general (in fact, calling
<TT>canvas.update</TT> from a spawned thread will likely
crash the GUI today), but some canvas calls such as movement seem to
be thread safe in the current implementation.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Of these three schemes, the first yields the smoothest animations but
makes other operations sluggish during movement, the second seems to
yield slower motion than the others but is safer than using threads
in general, and the last two both allow multiple objects to be in
motion at the same time.

<P class="docText">All three of the scripts in this section create a window of blue
ovals and red rectangles as you drag new shapes out with the left
mouse button. The drag-out implementation itself is inherited from
the superclass. A right mouse button click still moves a single shape
immediately, and a double-left click still clears the canvas
too -- other operations inherited from the original superclass. In
fact, all this new script really does is change the object creation
calls to add tags and colors here, add a text field, and add bindings
and callbacks for motion. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-FIG-38">Figure 8-38</A> shows what
this subclass's window looks like after dragging out a few
shapes to be animated.

<P class="docText">The "o" and "r" keys are set up to start
animation of all the ovals and rectangles you've drawn,
respectively. Pressing "o", for example, makes all the
blue ovals start moving synchronously. Objects are animated to mark
out five squares around their location, and move four times per
second. New objects drawn while others are in motion start to move
too, because they are tagged. You need to run these live to get a
feel for the simple animations they implement, of course (you could
try moving this book back and forth and up and down, but it's
not quite the same, and might look silly in public places).

<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.7.3.2 Using widget.after events</H5>

<P class="docText">The main drawback of this first approach is that only one animation
can be going at once: if you press "r" or "o"
while a move is in progress, the new request puts the prior movement
on hold until it finishes because each move callback handler assumes
the only thread of control while it runs. Screen updates are a bit
sluggish while moves are in progress too, because they only happen as
often as manual <TT>update</TT> calls are made (try a
drag-out or a cover/uncover of the window during a move to see for
yourself). <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-30">Example 8-30</A> specializes just the
<TT>moveInSquares</TT> method to remove such limitations.

<P class="docText">This version lets you make both ovals and rectangles move at the same
time -- drag out a few ovals and rectangles, and then press
"o" and then "r" right away to make this go.
In fact, try pressing both keys a few times; the more you press, the
more the objects move, because multiple scheduled events are firing
and moving objects from wherever they happen to be positioned. If you
drag out a new shape during a move, it starts moving immediately as
before.

<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.7.3.3 Using multiple time.sleep loop threads</H5>

<P class="docText">Running animations in threads can sometimes achieve the same effect;
it can be dangerous to update the screen from a spawned thread in
general, but works in this example, at least on Windows. <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-31">Example 8-31</A> runs each animation task as an independent and
parallel thread. That is, each time you press the "o" or
"r" keys to start an animation, a new thread is spawned
to do the work. This works on Windows, but failed on Linux at the
time I was writing this book -- the screen is not updated as
threads change it, so you won't see any changes until later GUI
events.

<P class="docText">This version lets you move shapes at the same time just like <A class="docLink" HREF="#python2-CHP-8-EX-30">Example 8-30</A>, but this time it's a reflection of
threads running in parallel. In fact, this uses the same scheme as
the first <TT>time.sleep</TT> version. Here, though, there
is more than one active thread of control, so move handlers can
overlap in time -- <TT>time.sleep</TT> only blocks the
calling thread, not the program at large. This seems to work (at
least on Windows), but it is usually safer to have your threads do
number crunching only, and let the main thread (the one that built
the GUI) handle any screen updates. It's not impossible that
GUI threads may be better supported in later Tkinter releases, so see
more recent releases for more details.

<H5 class="docSection3Title">8.7.3.4 Other animation options</H5>

<P class="docText">We'll revisit animation in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-9.html#python2-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>'s
PyDraw example; there, all three techniques will be resurrected to
move shapes, text, and photos to arbitrary spots on a canvas marked
with a mouseclick. And although the canvas widget's absolute
coordinate system make it the workhorse of most nontrivial
animations, Tkinter animation in general is limited mostly by your
imagination. As we saw in the flashing and hiding
<TT>alarm</TT> examples earlier, it's easy to change
the appearance of other kinds of widgets dynamically too; you can
even erase and redraw widgets and windows on the fly.
</P>

<P class="docText">I should also note that the sorts of movement and animation
techniques shown in this chapter and the next are suitable for many
game-like programs, but not all. For more advanced 3D animation
needs, be sure to also see the support in the PIL extension package
for common animation and movie file formats such as FLI and MPEG. As
currently implemented, Python is not widely used as the sole
implementation language of graphic-intensive game programs, but it
can still be used as both a prototyping and scripting language for
such products.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[4]</A></sup>
And when integrated with 3D graphics libraries, it can serve even
broader roles. See <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A> for links to other
