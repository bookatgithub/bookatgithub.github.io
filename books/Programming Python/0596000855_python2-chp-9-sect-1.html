<H3 class="docSection1Title">9.1 "Building a Better Mouse Trap"</H3>

<P class="docText">This chapter continues our look at building graphical user interfaces
with Python and its standard Tkinter library by presenting a
collection of realistic GUI programs. In the previous three chapters,
we met all the basics of Tkinter programming and toured the core set
of <span class="docEmphasis">widgets --</span> Python classes that generate
devices on a computer screen and may reply to user-generated events
like mouseclicks. Here, our focus is on putting those widgets
together to create more useful GUIs. We'll study:

</P> <blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="">[1]</A></sup> All of the larger examples in this book have a
"Py" at the start of their names. This is by convention
in the Python world. If you shop around at
<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A>, you'll find other
free software that follows this pattern too: PyApache (a Python
interface to the Apache web server), PySol (a Python/Tkinter
solitaire game system), and many more. I'm not sure who started
this pattern, but it has turned out to be a more or less subtle way
to advertise programming language preferences to the rest of the open
source world. Pythonistas are nothing if not subtle.</p></blockquote>

</UL>
<P class="docText">As in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-4.html#python2-CHP-4">Chapter 4</A>, and <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-5.html#python2-CHP-5">Chapter 5</A>,
I've pulled the examples in this chapter from my own library of
Python programs that I really use. For instance, the text editor and
clock GUIs that we'll meet here are day-to-day workhorses on my
machines. Because they are written in Python and Tkinter, they work
unchanged on both my Windows and Linux machines, and they should work
on Macs, too.
</P>

<P class="docText">And since these are pure Python scripts, their future evolution is
entirely up to their users -- once you get a handle on Tkinter
interfaces, changing or augmenting the behavior of such programs by
editing their Python code is a snap. Although some of these examples
are similar to commercially available programs (e.g., PyEdit is
reminiscent of the Windows Notepad accessory), the portability and
almost infinite configurability of Python scripts can be a decided
advantage.

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.1.1 Examples in Other Chapters</H4>

<P class="docText">Later in the book, we'll meet other Tkinter GUI programs that
put a good face on specific application domains. For instance, the
following larger GUI examples show up in later chapters, too:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">PyMail  --</span> an email client in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-11.html#python2-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A>
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">PyForm  --</span> a persistent object table viewer
in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-16.html#python2-CHP-16">Chapter 16</A>
</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">PyTree  --</span> a tree data structure viewer in
<A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-17.html#python2-CHP-17">Chapter 17</A>

</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">Most of these programs see regular action on my desktop, too. Because
GUI libraries are general-purpose tools, there are few domains that
cannot benefit from an easy-to-use, easy-to-program, and widely
portable user interface coded in Python and Tkinter.
</P>

<P class="docText">Beyond the examples in this book, you can also find higher-level GUI
toolkits for Python, such as the PMW system mentioned in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-6.html#python2-CHP-6">Chapter 6</A>. Such systems build upon Tkinter to provide
compound components such as notebook and tabbed widgets. We'll
also later meet programs that build user interfaces in web browsers,
not Tkinter. But apart from simple web-based interfaces, Tkinter GUIs
can be an indispensable feature of almost any Python program you
write.
</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.1.2 This Chapter's Strategy</H4>

<P class="docText">As for all case-study chapters in this text, this one is largely a
"learn by example" exercise; most of the programs here
are listed with minimal details. Along the way I'll point out
new Tkinter features that each example introduces, but I'll
also assume that you will study the listed source code and its
comments for more details. Python's readability becomes a
substantial advantage for programmers (and writers), especially once
we reach the level of complexity demonstrated by programs here.
</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, I want to remind you that all of the larger programs listed
in the previous sections can be run from the PyDemos and PyGadgets
launcher-bar GUIs that we met at the end of the previous chapter.
Although I will try hard to capture some of their behavior in screen
shots here, GUIs are event-driven systems by nature, and there is
nothing quite like running one live to sample the flavor of its user
interactions. Because of that, the launcher bars are really a
supplement to the material in this chapter. They should run on most
platforms and are designed to be easy to start (see the top-level
<I>README-PP2E.txt</I> file for hints). You should go
there and start clicking things immediately, if you haven't
done so already.
