<P class="docText">This concludes the GUI section of this book, but is not an end to its
GUI coverage. If you want to learn more about GUIs, be sure to see
the Tkinter examples that appear later in this book and are described
at the start of this chapter. PyMail, PyCalc, PyForm, and PyTree all
provide additional GUI case studies. In the next section of this
book, we'll also learn how to build user interfaces that run in
web browsers -- a very different concept, but another option for
simple interface design.
</P>

<P class="docText">Keep in mind, too, that even if you don't see a GUI example in
this book that looks very close to one you need to program,
you've already met all the building blocks. Constructing larger
GUIs for your application is really just a matter of laying out
hierarchical composites of the widgets presented in this part of the
text.
</P>

<P class="docText">For instance, a complex display might be composed as a collection of
radiobuttons, listboxes, scales, text fields, menus, and so
on -- all arranged in frames or grids to achieve the desired
appearance. Pop-up top-level windows, as well as independently run
GUI programs linked with IPC mechanisms like pipes, signals, and
sockets, can further supplement a complex graphical interface.
</P>

<P class="docText">Moreover, you can implement larger GUI components as Python classes
and attach or extend them anywhere you need a similar interface
device (see PyEdit for a prime example). With a little creativity,
Tkinter's widget set and Python support a virtually unlimited
number of layouts.
</P>

<P class="docText">Beyond this book, see the documentation and books departments at
Python's web site, <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</A>.
I would plug Tkinter-related texts here, but I suspect that the
offerings in this department will expand during the shelf-life of
this book. Finally, if you catch the Tkinter bug, I want to again
recommend downloading and experimenting with packages introduced in
<A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-6.html#python2-CHP-6">Chapter 6</A> -- especially PMW and PIL. Both add
additional tools to the Tkinter arsenal that can make your GUIs more
sophisticated with minimal coding.
