<H3 class="docSection1Title">Major Changes in This Edition</H3>

<P class="docText">The best way to get a feel for any book is to read it, of course. But
especially for people who are familiar with the first edition, the
next few sections go into more detail about what is new in this
edition.
</P>

<A NAME="python2-PREF-SECT-4.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">It's Been Updated for Python 2.0</H4>

<P class="docText">This edition has been updated for Python 2.0, and the Graphical User
Interface (GUI) material has been updated for Tk versions 8.0 or
later. Technically, this update was begun under Python 1.5.2, but all
examples were revisited for 2.0 before publication.
</P>

<P class="docText">For the trivia buffs among you: release 2.0 was the first Python
release following Guido's move to BeOpen, while 1.6 was the
last release from Guido's prior employer, CNRI. Just before I
finished this book's final draft and after the 2.0 release,
Guido and the core Python development team moved from BeOpen to
Digital Creations, home of the Zope web application construction kit,
but this move is independent of Python releases (see <A class="docLink" HREF="0596000855_python2-CHP-1.html#python2-CHP-1">Chapter 1</A>, for more details).
</P>

<P class="docText">Release 2.0 introduces a few language extensions, but 2.0 and 1.6 are
similar in content, and the updates just add a handful of features.
The examples in this book should generally work with later Python
releases. Remarkably, almost all examples in the first edition still
work five years later, with the latest Python releases; those that
didn't work required only small fixes (e.g., GUI call formats
and C API interfaces).
</P>

<P class="docText">On the other hand, although the core language hasn't changed
much since the first edition, a number of new constructs have been
added, and we'll apply them all here. Among these new Python
features: module packages, class exceptions, pseudo-private class
attributes, unicode strings, the new regular expression module, new
Tkinter features such as the grid manager, standard dialogs, and
top-level menus, and so on. A new appendix summarizes all of the
major changes in Python between the first and second editions of this
book.
</P>

<P class="docText">In addition to the language changes, this book presents new Python
tools and applications that have emerged in recent years. Among them:
the IDLE programming interface, the JPython (a.k.a.
"Jython") compiler, Active Scripting and COM extensions,
the Zope web framework, Python Server Pages (PSP), restricted
execution mode, the HTMLgen and SWIG code generators, thread support,
CGI and Internet protocol modules, and more (it's been a busy
five years). Such applications are the heart and soul of this second
edition.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-PREF-SECT-4.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">It's Been Refocused for a More Advanced Audience</H4>

<P class="docText">This edition presents Python programming by <span class="docEmphasis">advanced
examples</span>. Becoming proficient in Python involves two
distinct tasks: learning the core language itself, and then learning
how to apply it in applications. This edition addresses the latter
(and larger) of these tasks by presenting Python libraries, tools,
and programming techniques. Since this is a very different focus, I
should say a few words about its rationale here.
</P>

<P class="docText">Because there were no other Python books on the horizon at the time,
the first edition was written to appeal to many audiences at
once -- beginners and gurus alike. Since then, another
O'Reilly book, <span class="docEmphasis">Learning Python</span>, has been
developed to address the needs of beginners, and <span class="docEmphasis">Python
Pocket Reference</span> was published for readers seeking a short
Python reference. As a result, the core language introductory-level
material and the original reference appendixes have been removed from
this book.
</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Learning Python</span> introduces the core
language -- its syntax, datatypes, and so on -- using
intentionally simplistic examples. Many have found it to be ideal for
learning the language itself, but Python can become even more
interesting once you master the basic syntax and can write simple
examples at the interactive prompt. Very soon after you've
learned how to slice a list, you find yourself wanting to do real
things, like writing scripts to compare file directories, responding
to user requests on the Internet, displaying images in a window,
reading email, and so on. Most of the day-to-day action is in
applying the language, not the language itself.
</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Programming Python</span> focuses on the
"everything else" of Python development. It covers
libraries and tools beyond the core language, which become paramount
when you begin writing real applications. It also addresses larger
software design issues such as reusability and OOP, which can only be
illustrated in the context of realistically scaled programs. In other
words, <span class="docEmphasis">Programming Python</span>, especially in this
new edition, is designed to pick up where <span class="docEmphasis">Learning
Python</span> leaves off.
</P>

<P class="docText">Therefore, if you find this book too advanced, I encourage you to
read <span class="docEmphasis">Learning Python</span> as a prelude to this text,
and return here for the rest of the story once you've mastered
the basics. Unless you already have substantial programming
experience, this edition might serve you best as a second Python
text.
</P>


<A NAME="python2-PREF-SECT-4.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">It Covers New Topics</H4>

<P class="docText">Most of the changes in this edition were made to accommodate new
topics. There are new chapters and sections on Internet scripting,
CGI scripts, operating system interfaces, the SWIG integration code
generator, advanced Tkinter topics, the HTMLgen web page generator,
JPython, threads, restricted execution mode, and more. You should
consult the Table of Contents for the full scoop, but here are some
of the new topics and structural changes you'll find in this
edition:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">Topics</span></span></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The Internet, systems programming, Tkinter GUIs, and C integration
domains get much more attention, and are arguably now the main focus
of this text. For instance, you'll find six new chapters on
Internet scripting, covering client-side tools, server-side scripts
and web sites, and advanced Internet topics and systems. Four new
chapters address systems topics: threads, directory processing,
program launching, and so on. And the GUI material has also grown
from one chapter to a much more complete four-chapter presentation,
and now covers all widgets (including text and canvas), as well as
new grid, menu, and dialog support.
</P>
</DD><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">C integration</span></span></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The C extending and embedding chapters have been expanded to cover
new topics such as SWIG (<span class="docEmphasis">the</span> way to mix Python
with C/C++ libraries today) and present new mixed-mode examples such
as callback dispatch (extending plus embedding). C integration is at
the heart of many Python systems, but the examples in this domain are
inevitably complex, and involve large C programs that are only useful
to C users. In deference to readers who don't need to code C
integrations, this material is now isolated at the end of the text.
Some of the C code listings are gone as well -- to reduce page
count, I have opted instead to point readers to C source files on the
enclosed CD-ROM where possible (see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>).
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">Although later chapters build upon material in earlier chapters,
topics in this edition are covered fairly independently, and are
associated by book parts. Because of that, it's not too much of
a stretch to consider this edition to be akin to four or five books
in one. Its top-level structure underscores its application topics
focus:

<P class="docText">Two notes here: First of all, don't let these titles fool
you -- although most have to do with application topics, Python
language features and general design concepts are still explored
along the way, in the context of real-world goals. Second, readers
who use Python as a standalone tool can safely skip the integration
chapters, though I still recommend a quick glance. C programming
isn't nearly as fun or easy as Python programming. Yet because
integration is central to Python's role as a scripting tool, a
cursory understanding can be useful, regardless of whether you do
integrating, scripting, or both.
</P>

<P class="docText">First edition readers will notice that most of this material is new,
and even chapters with old titles contain largely new material.
Noticeably absent in this edition are the original Sneak Preview,
Mini Reference, Tutorial Appendix, and all of the old Part II -- a
reflection of the new focus and intended readership.

<A NAME="python2-PREF-SECT-4.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">It's More Example-Oriented</H4>

<P class="docText">This book is largely about its examples. In this edition, old
examples have been extended to become more realistic (e.g., PyForm
and PyCalc), and new examples have been added throughout. Among the
major examples, you'll find:

<P class="docText">There are also new mixed-mode C integration examples (e.g., callback

without "shadow" classes for C++), more Internet examples
(FTP upload and download scripts, NNTP and HTTP examples, email
tools, and new <TT>socket</TT> and
<TT>select</TT> module examples), many new examples of
Python threads, and new coverage of JPython, HTMLgen, Zope, Active
Scripting, COM, and Python database interfaces. Many of the new
examples are somewhat advanced, but of course this is now a somewhat
advanced text.
</P>

<P class="docText">In addition, the old Python/C embedding API (now called
<span class="docEmphasis">ppembed</span> ) has been extended to support
precompiling strings to bytecode, and the original calculator example
(now called <span class="docEmphasis">PyCalc</span>) has been beefed up to
support keyboard entry, history lists, colors, and more.
</P>

<P class="docText">In fact, the new book examples tree distributed on this
edition's CD-ROM (see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>) is <span class="docEmphasis">itself</span> a fairly
sophisticated Python software system, and the examples within it have
been upgraded structurally in a number of important ways:
</P>

<DL class="docList">
<DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Examples tree</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The entire examples distribution has been organized as one big Python
<span class="docEmphasis">module</span> <span class="docEmphasis">package</span> to
facilitate cross-directory imports and avoid name-clashes with other
Python code installed on your computer. Using directory paths in
import statements (instead of a complex PYTHONPATH) also tends to
make it easier to tell where modules come from. Moreover, you now
need to add only one directory to your PYTHONPATH search-path setting
for the entire book examples tree: the directory containing the
<I>PP2E</I> examples root directory. To reuse code in
this book within your own applications, simply import through the
<I>PP2E</I> package root (e.g., <TT>from</TT>
<TT>PP2E.Launcher</TT> <TT>import</TT>
<TT>which</TT>).
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Example filenames</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Module names are generally much less cryptic now. I punted on 8.3 DOS
compatibility long ago, and use more descriptive filenames.
I've also fixed some old all-uppercase filenames, which were a
last vestige of MS-DOS.
</P>
</DD><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Example titles</span></I></DT>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Labels of example listings now give the full directory pathname of
the example's source file to help you locate it in the examples
distribution. For instance, an example source-code file whose name is
given as <I>Example N-M: PP2E\Internet\Ftp\sousa.py</I>
refers to the file <I>sousa.py</I> in the
<I>PP2E\Internet\Ftp</I> subdirectory of the examples
distribution directory.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#">[3]</A></sup>

tree. On the CD (see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/python2">http://examples.oreilly.com/python2</A>), it's the topmost <I>Examples</I>
directory; if you've copied the examples to your machine,
it's wherever you copied (or unpacked) the
<I>PP2E</I> root directory. You can run most of the
examples from the CD directly, but you'll want to copy them to
your hard drive to make changes, and to allow Python to save

<A NAME="python2-PREF-SECT-4.5"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">It's More Platform-Neutral</H4>

<P class="docText">Except for some C integration examples, the majority of the programs
in this edition were developed on my Windows 98 laptop, with an eye
toward portability to Linux and other platforms. In fact, some of the
examples were born of my desire to provide portable Python
equivalents of tools missing on Windows (e.g., file splitters). When
programs are shown in action, it's usually on Windows; they are
demonstrated on the Red Hat Linux 6.x platform only if they exercise
Unix-specific interfaces.
</P>

<P class="docText">This is not a political statement at all -- I like Linux too.
It's mostly a function of the fact that I wrote this book with
MS Word; when time is tight, it's more convenient to run
scripts on the same platform as your publishing tools than to
frequently reboot into Linux. Luckily, because Python has now become
so portable to both Windows and Linux, the underlying operating
system is less of a concern to Python developers than it once was.
Python, its libraries, and its Tkinter GUI framework all work
extremely well on both platforms today.
</P>

<P class="docText">Because I'm not a politician, though, I've tried to make
the examples as platform-neutral as possible, and point out
platform-specific issues along the way. Generally speaking, most of
the scripts should work on common Python platforms unchanged. For
instance, all the GUI examples were tested on both Windows (98, 95)
and Linux (KDE, Gnome), and most of the command-line and thread
examples were developed on Windows but work on Linux too. Because
Python's system interfaces are generally built to be portable,
this is easier than it may sound.
</P>

<P class="docText">On the other hand, this book does delve into platform-specific topics
where appropriate. There is new coverage of many Windows-specific
topics -- Active Scripting, COM, program launch options, and so
on. Linux and Unix readers will also find material geared towards
their platforms -- forks, pipes, and the like. There is also new
discussion of ways to edit and run Python programs on most major
platforms.
</P>

<P class="docText">The one place where readers may still catch a glimpse of platform
biases is in the Python/C integration examples. For simplicity, the C
compilation details covered in this text are still somewhat
Unix/Linux-biased. One can at least make a reasonable case for such a
focus -- not only does Linux come with C compilers for free, but
its development environment grew up around that language. On Windows,
the C extension code shown in this book will work, but you may need
to use different build procedures that vary per Windows compiler.
O'Reilly has published an outstanding text, <span class="docEmphasis">Python
Programming on Win32</span>, that covers Windows-specific Python
topics like this, and should help address some of the disparity here.
If you do Windows-specific programming, please see that book for all
Windows details skipped here.

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">But It's Still Not a Reference Manual</H2>

<P class="docText">Please note that this edition, like the first, is still more of a
<span class="docEmphasis">tutorial</span> than a reference manual (despite
sharing a title pattern with a popular Perl reference text). This
book aims to teach, not document. You can use its table of contents
and index to track down specifics, and the new structure helps make
this easy to do. But this edition is still designed to be used in
conjunction with, rather than to replace, Python reference manuals.
Because Python's manuals are free, well-written, available
online, and change frequently, it would be folly to devote space to
parroting their contents. For an exhaustive list of all tools
available in the Python system, consult other books (e.g.,
O'Reilly's <span class="docEmphasis">Python Pocket Reference</span>)
or the standard manuals at Python's web site and on this
