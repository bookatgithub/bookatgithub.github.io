<b class="bold">About the Author</b>
</p>
<p class="first-para">
<b class="bold">Dennis Shasha</b> is a professor of computer science at the Courant Institute of New York University, where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for microarrays, combinatorial design, and network inference; with physicists, musicians, and financial people on algorithms for time series; and on database applications in untrusted environments. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching.</p>
<p class="first-para">Because he likes to type, he has written five books of puzzles before this one, a biography about great computer scientists, and technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, and time series. In addition, he has co-written more than fifty journal papers, sixty conference papers, and seven patents. For fun, he writes the monthly puzzle column for the <i class="emphasis">Scientific American</i> website and sometimes for <i class="emphasis">Dr. Dobb&rsquo;s Journal</i>.</p>

<b class="bold">Acknowledgments</b>
</p>
<p class="first-para">My warmest thanks to the readers of my puzzles. They span every continent except Antarctica and they reveal their intelligence with every communication. Some readers have become good friends, such as that gifted teacher and mathematician Andy Liu and the irrepressibly creative architect Mike Whittaker. When a puzzle that I have invented talks back and twists itself into a version that I can&rsquo;t answer, I call in my puzzle brain trust. If I were faced with a math/computational problem of great difficulty, I would huddle with these gifted individuals for a week and we&rsquo;d solve it.</p>
<p class="first-para">Many of these puzzles have benefited greatly from the editorial suggestions of <i class="emphasis">Scientific</i> <i class="emphasis">American&rsquo;s</i> John Rennie and Jon Erickson and Deirdre Blake of <i class="emphasis">Dr. Dobb&rsquo;s</i>. Editors are the first clarity test that an author has of the written version of a puzzle. These editors have surgically exposed any obscurities they have found in my writing. I often pose the oral version of a puzzle to a certain young man named Tyler. Besides solving them (sometimes with the help of a hint or two), he makes it clear when he considers them &ldquo;lame&rdquo; (bad) or &ldquo;ill&rdquo; (cool). Only the ill ones see print.</p>
<p class="first-para">Gary Zamchick has graced some of the puzzles with his irreverent cartoons. He has the remarkable ability to capture the essence of a puzzle with just a few pen strokes. This book&rsquo;s <a href="BBL0052.html#439" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Part III</a>, &ldquo;<a href="BBL0052.html#439" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Faithful Foes</a>,&rdquo; requires Dr. Ecco and you to navigate a labyrinth of tunnels and treachery. Karen Shasha has managed, in her photographs, to portray the spirit of that quest exactly as I have envisioned it.</p>
<p class="first-para">My acquisitions editor, Carol Long; my development editor, Sara Shlaer; the book&rsquo;s copy editor, Mildred Sanchez; and the book&rsquo;s designer, LeAndra Hosier, have put up with my demands for ever higher visual appeal and supported the demands of the text. If this book is a winner, they are in large part responsible.</p>
