<p class="para">Biologists study not only genes, but also genomes, proteomes, interactomes, basically anything <i CLASS="EMPHASIS">omic</i>, that is, anything having to do with entire species. It&rsquo;s a perspective that might hurt many delicate human egos.</p> 
<p class="PARA">For example, we have roughly the same number of genes as mice and most are very similar in form and function. We think of ourselves as a higher form of life, but the genome itself doesn&rsquo;t bear that out. The difference must be in the interactions, the networks of binding and repulsion that give rise to the unique capabilities of each species.</p> 
<p class="para">A puzzle that obsesses biologists is to figure out why protein interaction networks have the topologies they do. You see, most proteins have very few connections, and very few have many connections. We call members of the latter groups the <i class="emphasis">hubs</i>. This gives rise to what are sometimes called <i CLASS="emphasis">scale-free</i> networks reminiscent of Mandelbrot&rsquo;s fractals or in fact the Web. You can build a scale-free network as follows: Make 70 percent of all nodes have one edge and the remaining 30 percent have two or more. Of the 30 percent, 70 percent have two edges exactly and 30 percent have three edges or more. Of these 30 percent, 70 percent have three edges exactly and 30 percent have four edges or more, and so on.</p> 
<p CLASS="para">One theory is that scale-free networks have good failure properties. The thinking goes like this: Because mutations strike randomly at the genome, most mutations will wound proteins that interact with very few other proteins, thus are presumably less important. Fatal mutations of hub proteins can occur too, but they are rare, because hubs are rare.</p>
<p class="PARA">A typical problem is to determine how many interaction links are needed to achieve high fault tolerance while ensuring that no unwounded protein is more than two interaction links away from another one.</p> 
<p class="para">If there were just four protein nodes, then a simple square of interactions would achieve this goal (see <a class="internaljump" href="#ch0">Figure 1-6</a>). Removing any node allows any remaining pair of nodes to communicate over at most two links.</p>
