<p class="para">You and I play a game that bears a strong family resemblance to the board game <i class="emphasis">Mastermind</i>. I think of a five binary digit secret number, e.g., 10101. You are allowed to pose questions about bit sequences of length five. Such a question is called a &ldquo;bit question.&rdquo; My responses will report how many bits in your guess have their correct value in the correct place.</p>
<p class="para">For example, if your bit question is 10110 and my secret is 10101, then three of your bits (the first three, though I won&rsquo;t tell you that) are in the correct place with their correct value. On the other hand, I could have other secret numbers that are consistent with the three-are-correct answer such as 00100.</p>

<p class="para">I&rsquo;ve become decidedly less friendly. You pose an initial bit question, to which I give no response at all - ever.

<p class="first-para"> How does this generalize if the code is N digits long, but the digits could be base b for some b &gt; 2? For example, b could be 10 and all digits 0 through 9 would be allowed. I have a solution when all answers come at the end, but that requires 1 + (b-1) &times; N questions. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s optimal.</p>
