<b class="bold"> How does Jeremy maximize the amount of cake he gets, given these rules? How</b> <b class="bold">much will he get?</b>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">Jeremy cuts the first cake in the fractions f and 1-f, where f is at least 1/2. Then if Marie chooses first, Jeremy will get 1 1/4 cakes from the last two by the argument of the warm-up. If Marie chooses second, Jeremy will get f and then will divide the last two cakes in half. So, f + 1/2 + 1/2 = (1 - f) + 1 1/4. That is, f + 1 = 2 1/4 - f. 2f = 1 1/4. That is f = 5/8. Therefore, Jeremy will receive 1 5/8 cakes and Marie will receive 1 3/8 cakes.</p>

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">There is an inductive pattern. If for k cakes where Marie gets the first choice in all but one, Jeremy still has an advantage A (that is, Jeremy would receive A more cake than Marie among those k), then Jeremy will still have an advantage for k+1 cakes. Here is why: Jeremy, knowing that he will have an advantage of A if Marie chooses first for the first cake, cuts the first piece into two pieces 1/2 + A/4 and 1/2 - A/4. If Marie chooses the piece having 1/2 + A/4, then Jeremy will suffer a disadvantage of A/2 for that first cake, but will gain an advantage of A for the remaining k cakes, so have a net advantage of A/2. By contrast, if Marie chooses to go second for the first cake, then Jeremy will cut the remaining cakes in half. Again he will have an overall advantage of A/2. Thus, Jeremy&rsquo;s advantages from 1/2 for two cakes, to 1/4 for three cakes, to 1/8 for four cakes, to <span class="unicode">&hellip;</span> 1/64 for seven cakes.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">If the vote is two against one, then bet x on the majority. If you lose, the advisor in the minority must be the truth-teller so you can bet everything on the next two bets by following the advice of the truth-teller. This gives you 4 &times; (100 - x). If you win by following the majority the first time, you should disregard the advisor in the minority and you&rsquo;ll have 100+x after the first bet. In the next bet, if the remaining two agree, you bet everything because one must always tell the truth. But if not, you&rsquo;ll find out who is telling the truth by betting nothing. On the last bet, you follow the truth teller and end up with at least 2 &times; (100 + x).</p>
<a name="204"></a><a name="IDX-"></a>
<p class="para">Setting 4 &times; (100 - x) = 2 &times; (100 + x), you conclude that 6x = 200 or x = 33 1/3.

Similarly, in the third bet, if the outcome were 0, then D and B would both be possible partial truth tellers in bet 4. Thus, no series of outcomes ever teaches you whom to trust.

<p class="para">Now, we must do a case analysis.</p>
<p class="para">
<b class="bold">Case 1:</b> Suppose you bet nothing on bet 3. Suppose the outcome is 1. Now you know that D is the partial truth teller because everyone else has lied twice. However, D may still lie once. If D advises 1 in bet 4 and you bet $x on 1, then if x &lt; 50 and D tells the truth in bet 4, you cannot bet anything on bet 5 because D could lie then. If x <span class="unicode">&ge;</span> 50, then D could lie in bet 4 and you will never do better than regain your original capital. So, if you bet nothing, you cannot attain $150.</p>
<p class="para">
<b class="bold">Case 2:</b> Suppose you bet something on 0 in bet 3. Then your situation is as in case 1, only worse.</p>
<p class="para">
<b class="bold">Case 3:</b> Suppose you bet $x on 1 in bet 3. If x &lt; $12.50, then suppose further the outcome is in fact 1 and you bet $y in bet 4 on the outcome offered by D and x + y &lt; 50. Then, if you win in bet 4, you cannot bet in bet 5 (because D may lie). If x + y &gt; 50, then y &gt; $37.50, so if you lose bet 4, you will have less than $75, so cannot attain $150 in bet 5. Therefore x <span class="unicode">&ge;</span> $12.50.</p>
<p class="para">Now suppose that you bet $x on 1 in bet 3, but the outcome is 0. Then you have $100 - x and you know that B, C, and D have all lied once. In bet 4, two of them must advise one outcome and one must advise the other. Let&rsquo;s say you bet $z on the outcome suggested by the majority. Then x + z <span class="unicode">&le;</span> 25; otherwise losing in bets 3 and 4 will leave you less than $75, making it impossible to attain $150 in bet 5. But this implies z <span class="unicode">&le;</span> $12.50 and therefore if you win in bet 4, you will have at most $100 and D can still lie in bet 5. If you bet with the minority in bet 4, the majority could be telling the truth and then there would remain two advisors who have lied only once.</p>
<p class="last-para">Therefore, you cannot guarantee to attain $150. In fact, a refinement of this argument shows you cannot even attain $134. Ivan Rezanka has argued that $133.33 can be guaranteed, but a short elegant proof is still missing.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">Bob will win with probability 3/4. In the penultimate round, he bets nothing. No matter what Alice bets, she cannot exceed 100 units. If Alice loses in the penultimate round, then since she must state her bet first in the last round, Bob just bets as she does in that round and is guaranteed to win. If Alice wins in the penultimate round, then, in the last round, Bob simply bets all his units on the coin face opposite to the one Alice chooses. (If Alice doesn&rsquo;t bet in the last round, Bob can bet everything on, say, heads.) So Bob will win 3/4 of the time.</p>

If Bob bets all 51 on heads and the result is tails, then again Alice is sure to win on the last flip. If Bob bets anything on heads and the result is heads, then Bob has at most 102 and Alice has 52. In that case, on the last flip, Alice bets everything on the opposite face to Bob&rsquo;s and she will win 1/2 the time regardless of what Bob bets. So, Alice wins at least 1/2 the time and will win more often if Bob plays foolishly. A good move for Bob would be simply to bet the same amount as Alice on the same face (so 2 on heads if Alice bets 2 on heads) in the penultimate flip. He can then bet nothing on the last flip and be sure to win with probability 1/2.</p>

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">Following the idea of the sultan&rsquo;s daughters problem, we will express our protocols in terms of three numbers in increasing order: n1, n2, and n3. The idea is to reject the paper values in the first n1 balls, then choose the first ball whose paper value is greater than the highest of those in the first n1 balls. Call the ball number of the first capture b1 (so b1 &gt; n1).</p>
<a name="211"></a><a name="IDX-"></a>
<p class="para">If b1 &gt; n2, then make the second capture at a ball whose paper value is a greater number than any paper value seen in the first b1 balls. Otherwise (when b1 <span class="unicode">&le;</span> n2), reject all paper values until the first n2 balls (altogether) have been seen and then make the second capture occur at a ball whose paper value is greater than any seen so far in the first n2. Call the position of the second capture b2.</p>
<p class="para">If b2 &gt; n3, then choose, for the third capture, the paper value greater than any seen before position b2. Otherwise, reject until position n3 and then pick the next one better than any seen before the first n3. Call the position of the third capture b3.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, if the highest value happens to be in the first n1 balls, then you will never choose anything, but it wouldn&rsquo;t help to do so anyway. That suggests that it is useful to make n1 rather small.</p>
<p class="para">For 100 balls in total and 3 captures, you win roughly 68 percent of the time if you set n1, n2, and n3 to be 14, 32, and 64, respectively.</p>
<p class="para">Consider, for example, the following sequence of 100 values where each dollar amount written by your adversary has been replaced by its rank. That is, the highest dollar figure is replaced by 99 and the lowest by 0.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="para">The b1 position value in this case would be 23 where the value 97 is found, because 97 is the first value larger than 95, which is the largest of the first 14 numbers. The b2 value would be 38 where 99 is found and the third capture then is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="para">The bottom line: Take the bet.</p>
<p class="para">There may be an elegant analytical way to solve this problem as there is for the original sultan&rsquo;s daughters problem, but the puzzle is so amenable to programming, it didn&rsquo;t seem worth it. Simply choose ascending triples and then, for each triple, generate 10,000 random permutations of the numbers between 0 and 99 (the ranks) and see how often you win. Such a strategy is not limited to triples, obviously.</p>

This is the best possible for P  <a name="217"></a><a name="IDX-"></a>  because each southerly step that P forces requires for compensation at most one east-or-west plus one northerly step by T. Here is the calculation. T needs nine steps even without obstruction. Add to that one by P to change directions to east-or-west plus four southerly steps forced by P, each of which requires two compensatory steps by T.

The thief then moves east or west and then the police force a move south again. The police eventually force the thief all the way down to row 1, but facing away from the northern border. This requires eight steps by the police and 15 steps by the thief. So the police intervene 8 times out of every 23.</p>

The cost of the phrases beginning with C would then increase from 15 to 19, but the cost of the phrases beginning with B would decrease from 16 to 10. If two of the DCBAs were CDBs instead, then the cost of phrases beginning with D would not increase at all. So the worst kind of message from the point of this encoding is that two of the phrases that begin with B have no following A. The total cost of such a message is 25 + 15 + 6 + 10 + 15 = 71.</p>

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">R, B, W, RBB, BWW, WWW, RBW, BRR; 8 altogether. The method here was to build up from small numbers. There could be no bags with two marbles because then they would differ from the singleton bags by just one marble.</p>

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">If there is one R, one B and 16 Ws, then the best that Carol can do is to pack seven bags: W, R, B, WW, WWW, WWWW, WWWWW. The other W can be put either in a bag with a R or a B. Eight is not possible in this case because once there are only white marbles left, bags may differ only by number. If there are more than one red (or blue or both) marbles, but still fewer of these than white ones, then those red or blue marbles can be substituted for white ones in the larger bags. So Carol can guarantee at least seven bags, but no more.</p>

</p>
</li>

<p class="para">This solution is from the classic puzzle book of Dudeney written a century ago. The pairs for each day are separated by spaces. You&rsquo;ll see that except for the A column, all other columns are different rotations of BEGFKHICDLJ, a sequence of letters in which all the non-A letters appear exactly once. Consider some letter, say E. By construction, E is in each one of the non-A columns exactly once. Therefore E plays against A. Also, by construction, E is in a given day&rsquo;s row exactly once (because all the rotations differ).</p>

</ul>
<p class="para">How do we know that E encounters every other letter? In every pair of columns, except the leftmost, E encounters two teams. We just have to ensure that the teams in question are different every time. This is the case because if we list the pairs of columns by the offset from the first letter in the sequence BEGFKHICDLJ, then we see that the column paired with A begins at B, so is at an offset of 0. The next pair begins with C and D respectively at offsets 7 and 8, so their offsets differ by 1. We&rsquo;ll denote that fact by the sentence &ldquo;CD are at offsets 7 and 8, so the offsets differ by 1.&rdquo;</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">Because the various column pairs differ by different offsets, a given pair XY will meet in only one column pair. For example, E and B will meet in the column pair with offset 1, as will E and G. E and F as well as E and J will meet in the column pair with offset 2 and so on. Whereas we have used E as an example, the same reasoning holds for all letters B to L. The case of A is clear by inspection of the first two columns.</p>

Each switchboard node needs a direct link to non-neighbors only. Each switchboard is the neighbor to all but two of the other switchboards. Linking to those non-neighbors adds a total of 12 &times; 2 = 24 to the collective degree of the switchboard nodes. This translates to half that number of edges, for a total of 12.

Do the following 10,000 times: Take the 18 numbers uniformly at random without replacement (i.e., never take the same one again) over the range of 1 to 4,000. See if any group has more than 1% failures. You will see that between 14% and 15% of the time, at least one group does. This again is a false guilty rate.</p>

<p class="first-para">I first heard this puzzle from Peter Winkler. Michael Rabin explained the procedural agent idea to me. What is truly fascinating about this problem is the use of arbitrary assignments. In this, as well as in several other puzzles described or invented by Winkler, the idea is to commit everything to one approach. You either win all the time or lose often - kind of a start-up mentality.</p>

<p class="para">By the way, if you happen to be an algebraist, characterizing when the contestant wins can be expressed succinctly: You win whenever the colors arranged in the boxes guarantee that the longest cycle in the arbitrary permutation is of length n/2 or less. Let me explain. First, notice that the mapping from colors to numbers is a permutation (a rearrangement) of those colors. For example,</p>
<ul class="simple-list">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="first-para">Black<span class="unicode">&rarr;</span>box 1</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">

</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">says that Black should be put first in the list, White should be put second, and so on. We don&rsquo;t move the chips, of course, but it is in this way that we can think of these assignments as a permutation. Now, a cycle occurs when following the box colors happens to return us to a box we&rsquo;ve already visited.</p>
<a name="258"></a><a name="IDX-"></a>
<p class="para">Suppose, for example, that the six boxes have the following colors:</p>
<ul class="simple-list">

<p class="para">At this point we win, but note that the next block to look at would be box 1.

In this case, the cycle in the permutation is of length three 1<span class="unicode">&rarr;</span>5<span class="unicode">&rarr;</span>2<span class="unicode">&rarr;</span>1.

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">The probability of winning under FeedYes is about 0.89 when Pgood is 0.9. It cannot be better than 0.9 because if you are on the second from top row and adjacent to the winning square, there is some chance of losing. The strategy for FeedYes consists of trying to reduce the horizontal distance to the goal to zero (or to one on rows that are an odd distance away). Calculating the probability involves the following key recurrence ideas: If you are n steps (n &gt; 0) away from the top row and 0 distance away, then your probability of hitting is the same as the probability of hitting if you are n-1 steps away and one away from column 5. Otherwise, with probability Pgood you will be one column closer to your goal and with probability 1-Pgood you will be one farther from the goal, both with n-1 steps.</p>
<p class="para">Under the FeedNo strategy, the probability is about 0.55 when Pgood is 0.9. To compute the probability for FeedNo, assume a strategy that will take four aims to the right and three aims to the left since this gives the best likelihood of hitting the destination. Given this, there are four ways to win: All seven aims are true; three of the right aims are true and two of the left are; two of the right are true and one of the left; and one right and zero left.</p>

<b class="bold"> What is the smallest number of bit questions sufficient to determine a five-bit</b> <b class="bold">sequence no matter what it is? Remember that none of your bit questions need</b> <b class="bold">be correct. You just need to know how to crack the secret at the end.</b>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">Five are sufficient, even if all answers come at the end. Here are the guesses:</p>
<ul class="simple-list">
<li class="first-listitem">

<p class="first-para">11110</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="first-para">11111</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">Here&rsquo;s why this is enough. Number the positions from left to right at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Consider position i. Suppose that there is a 1 in position i, for i &gt; 1. Then the number correct will increase by one in the reported answers of the i<sup>th</sup> bit question compared to the previous 1. For example, suppose the fourth position has a 1. That is, the secret code has the form xxx1x. Then 11110 will have a number count that is one higher than 11100. Conversely, if the fourth position has a 0, then 11110 will have a number count that is one less than 11100.</p>
<p class="para">So far, we know about all bit positions except i = 1. We can determine the value of that bit position by examining the number correct for 10000. For example, if the last four digits are 0110, then the secret code is either 00110 or 10110. If the secret code were 00110, then the first bit question (10000) would yield a number correct of 2. If the secret code were 10110, then the number correct would be 3.</p>
<p class="para">It turns out that four questions are enough also. Make the first two questions be 00000 and 11100. In most cases, this narrows down the bit sequences quite substantially. For example, if the answers to these first two questions are 4 and 1, respectively, then the remaining possibilities are: 00001 and 00010. So we will focus on the two difficult situations where there are six possibilities left. Those situations occur when the answers to the first two questions are either 2 and 3 respectively or 3 and 2 respectively. Suppose the answers to the first two questions are 2 and 3 respectively. Then the remaining possibilities are:</p>

<p class="para">Each possible sequence of five bits will give four answers and those answers differ for any pair of sequences. For example, suppose 11001 is the secret.

No other bit sequence produces this same signature of answers: 2 3 1 2. Thus, you make the above four guesses, look at the signature, and determine which is the secret bit sequence.

<p class="para">If the answers are given immediately after they are asked, Tom Rokicki suggests the following approach requiring only five questions altogether. The basic idea is to use the fact that three answers are possible (same (S), increase (+), or decrease (-)) whereas our method for the previous question used only + and -. Start with 00000 again. Next guess 3 (that is 00011 in binary). This changes two bits, so if the answer is S (same number correct), then one of these 1s is correct and one isn&rsquo;t. On the other hand, if the answer is + (increase), then both must be correct. Similarly, if the answer is -. Continue with this reasoning and you&rsquo;ll find the answer.

</ol>
<p class="para">The point to which the total distance is guaranteed to be at a minimum is the median. That is, if there are an odd number n of values altogether, then the sum of the distances to the  <a name="271"></a><a name="IDX-"></a>  median is smaller than to any other point. Here is why. Suppose the median is m. Let the total distance to m be x. Now consider the total distance to m+1. Because m is a median, there are (n-1)/2 values that are m or less. So, at least 1+(n-1)/2 values increase their distance by 1 when calculating the total distance to m+1, including the median again. At most (n-1)/2 values decrease their distance by at most 1 when calculating the total distance to m+1.</p>
<p class="para">So if there are 17 numbers and the median is 35, the mean is 34 and the distance to 38 is x+5, then there is one instance of 35, no instances of 36, and one instance of 37. Here is why: If there were one instance of 35, zero instances of 36 and 37, then the distance to 38 would increase by 3 &times; 8 = 24 for the numbers below 35 and decrease by 3 &times; 8 for the numbers greater than or equal to 38. The distance for 35 itself would increase by 3. This would give a net increase of 3. The fact that there is a net increase of 4 must mean that there is an instance of 37. In this case the net decrease for the upper eight values would be 3 &times; 7 = 21 for those greater than or equal to 38 and 1 for 37. This implies that there are seven values that are 38 or greater and one 35 and one 37. Because the mean is 34, the total distance to the mean of the numbers greater than the mean is at least 1 + 3 + 28; we get those numbers from the 35, the 37, and the seven values that are 38 or greater. This total is 32. The values below the mean must match this, so they must all be 30s. Since they cannot be less than 30, the uppermost value cannot be greater than 38. So there are eight 30s, one 35, one 37, and seven 38s.</p>

<p class="para">With a big extra bucket, one can obtain any mixture satisfying a ratio p/(p+q) of supertox where p and q are whole numbers whose sum is 100 or less. Here&rsquo;s what you do: Create p liters of supertox and dump them into the big extra bucket and then q liters of water and dump. Now you have that ratio. Suppose you want 53 liters, for example. You fill the 10-liter vessel five times and put the results in the big bucket. Now fill the 10-liter vessel one more time, pour into the 7-liter vessel. The three liters left over go into the big bucket. So, in this case, we want a mixture of 10 liters or more having a concentration of 26% of supertox. So, if we had 13 liters of supertox and 37 liters of water, that would do it. Fill the 10-liter vessel with supertox; pour into the big bucket. Fill the 10-liter vessel with supertox  <a name="276"></a><a name="IDX-"></a>  and pour it into the 7-liter vessel. The 3 remaining liters go into the big bucket. Empty the 7-liter vessel into the supertox reservoir. Obtaining 37 liters of water is easy, of course (three 10s and a 7). Once you have the mixture, fill the 10-liter vessel. There will be 2.6 liters of supertox in there.</p>

<b class="bold"> Suppose that we want to get mixtures that are all supertox, 1/2 supertox, 1/3</b> <b class="bold">supertox, 1/4 supertox, ... 1/50 supertox. You are allowed to specify the size of the</b> <b class="bold">two vessels.

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="para">Suppose we want all fractions up to 1/k. In our case, k = 50. Let the basic unit be 0.6 liters and then the smaller bucket can be 17 basic units or 10.2 liters, and the larger bucket can be 50 basic units or 30 liters. Because 17 is a prime number, we can generate any number k of units between 1 and 49 from these even without the extra bucket. Start by generating 1 unit of supertox and putting it in the big bucket (which can be very small in fact). Then generate k units of water and mix.</p>
<p class="last-para">This extremely elegant solution is due to Ivan Rezanka. Ivan has shown how to solve this problem without the extra bucket. The basic hint is to put an amount of supertox in the large vessel such that when the vessel is subsequently filled to completion with water, the desired concentration is achieved. This can be done if the larger vessel is viewed as consisting of L units where L is the least common multiple of numbers 2, 3, <span class="unicode">&hellip;</span>, k.</p>

<p class="para">Here is the reasoning. If no probe detects a tunnel, then the tunnel goes north up the center. It has no choice, because there are no loops. If a tunnel goes through a probe (represented by a circle), we can tell whether it is coming from the south and whether it is going north, west, or east. For example, if neither probe at row 2 detects the tunnel, then the tunnel must go north up the center at least till east-west cross street 3. By contrast, if the tunnel approaches the probe at row 2, column 5 from the west and leaves going north, then we know the following: The tunnel went north from Start one block, then turned east one block (where it encounters the probe), then turned north one block (to arrive at column 5 and row 3). In general, each pair of probes at row i can determine which column (north-south road) was used in coming from row i-1 and which column is taken to go to row i+1. That information is enough to determine the east-west directions on each row.</p>

<p class="para">The technique uses graph theory. Each circle in the figure is a &ldquo;node&rdquo; and each arrow represents a one-way edge. In graph-theoretic notation, let graph G1 = (N1, E1), where N1 is a set of nodes and E1 is a set of directed (one-way) edges on those nodes. Similarly, G2 = (N2, E2).</p>
<p class="para">In the pseudo-code below, , means set union.

Also, <span class="unicode">&cap;</span> means set intersect. For example {X, Y, Z} <span class="unicode">&cap;</span>{Z, W} = {Z}. Finally, the minus sign (-) means set difference. For example {X, Y, Z} - {Z, W} = {X, Y}.</p>
<p class="para">A cycle is a tour that starts at some node X and ends at X such that it always follows the one-way edges. A    root is a node such that no one-way edge points to that node.</p>

  If e is in E1 - E2, then e has a mark of 1
  If e is in E2 - E1, then e has a mark of 2.
To find a consistent set of preferences, find the fewest
  edges having marks of 1 or 2 such that dropping them eliminates
  all cycles.
To find a consistent ordering, start at a root of H
  and write down its label. Then eliminate that root and
  edges leaving that root from H, then repeat.</pre>

</div>
<p class="para">This pseudo-code guarantees to find a consistent ordering, because any cycle-free graph will be consistent. To obtain a cycle-free graph, it is sufficient to eliminate marked edges, because unmarked ones are shared and we know that each spouse alone has produced a graph without cycles.</p>
<p class="last-para">This is not quite an algorithm in that I did not tell you how to find the fewest edges to drop. In fact, that problem is NP-complete (a topic we&rsquo;ll discuss in <a href="BBL0036.html#294" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Part II</a>), so it is hard to find the fewest such edges, but heuristics such as simulated annealing (also discussed in <a href="BBL0036.html#294" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">Part II</a>) work well.</p>

In that case, the $53 would require change. If your teenager has no check for $50, but one for a lesser amount x, then your teenager also requires a check for $50 - $x.

<p class="para">Each department sends back its median. Order them in ascending order and denote the medians as M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 and their respective departmental groups as G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5. <a class="internaljump" href="#ch0">Figure 1-27</a> shows this ordering</p>

<p class="para">The number M3 must be one of the middle nine of the 25 blood pressure values. Here is why: Two sailors in G3 have blood pressures less than or equal to M3, the three lowest blood pressures of G2 must be less than or equal to M3, and the three lowest pressures of G1 must be less than or equal to M3.

<p class="para">Again the captain asks for the medians of each department.

Here is why: M1 is less than or equal to two blood pressure values of G1 and three from each of the groups G2, G3, G4, and G5 for a total of 14 values. These are shown in <a class="internaljump" href="#ch0">Figure 1-29</a>. So M1 is certainly less than or equal to the median. Symmetrically, M5 is certainly greater than or equal to the median.</p>
