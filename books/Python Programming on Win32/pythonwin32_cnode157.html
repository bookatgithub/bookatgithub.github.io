<FONT><h2>Chapter
20. GUI Development</h2>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1915"></a>In
this chapter, we examine the various options for developing graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.</p>



<p>We will look in some detail at three of the GUI toolkits that operate
on the Windows platform: Tkinter, PythonWin, and wxPython. Each of
these GUI toolkits provide a huge range of facilities for creating
user interfaces, and to completely cover any of these toolkits is
beyond the scope of this single chapter. Each framework would need
its own book to do it justice.</p>



<P>Our intent in this chapter is to give you a feel for each of these
GUI frameworks, so you can understand the basic model they use and
the problems they were designed to address. We take a brief tour of
each of these toolkits, describing their particular model and
providing sample code along the way. Armed with this information, you
can make an informed decision about which toolkit to use in which
situation, have a basic understanding of how your application will
look, and where it will run when finished.</P>



<P>The authors need to express their gratitude to Gary Herron for the
Tkinter section, and Robin Dunn for the wxPython section. Their
information helped us complete this chapter.</P>
