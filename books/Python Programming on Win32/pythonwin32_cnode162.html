<FONT><h2>Chapter
21. Active Scripting</h2>


<p>
<a NAME="idx2035"></a>Active
<a naME="idx2036"></A>Scripting is a COM-based technology from
Microsoft that allows applications to plug in different languages for
macros or scripting. Rather than force the application to choose a
single scripting language, end users of the application can pick the
language they're most comfortable with. The application need
not know anything specific about the scripting language; indeed, the
language may have been written (or support for Active Scripting
added) after the application was written.</P>



<p>The best examples of this technology are
<a naME="idx2037"></A>
<A name="idx2038"></a>Microsoft's
<a name="idx2039"></a>Internet
Explorer (IE) and <a name="idx2040"></a> <a namE="idx2041"></A>Internet Information Server
(IIS). IE supports client-side scripting; an HTML file can have
script code embedded in it in any language, and when the browser
displays the page, it executes the code. Hence the term client-side
scripting: the script code is actually executed on the client PC, the
PC with the browser. IIS includes a component called Active Server
Pages (ASP) that supports active scripting. Similar to IE, the code
is embedded inside HTML files, but ASP executes the code at the
server before it's converted to the final HTML sent to the
client.</P>



<P>Many Microsoft applications are starting to support Active Scripting.
These applications typically come standard with VBScript and
JScript<FOnT SiZE="1"><Sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></suP></FONt>

language implementations, and all documentation and sample code use
one of these languages. In fact, many users of these applications (IE
and IIS users included) aren't aware you can use additional
languages as well as the standard ones. Using a language such as
Python and its extensive library can help you take full advantage of
these applications.</p>


<blOCKQuote><FONT size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></suP>
VBScript is a redistributable Active
Scripting implementation by Microsoft using a subset of the Visual
Basic language. JScript, also implemented by Microsoft and
redistributable, uses syntax somewhat like Java.</P>
</FONT></bLOcKQUotE>





<P>Each application that supports Active Scripting exposes an object
model to the script code. Regardless of the language the script is
using, the object model available is identical. Although this is the
key strength of Active Scripting, it's also a problem when
attempting to document how to use it. If we discuss how to use Active
Scripting within IE, it really doesn't help you use Active
Scripting within IIS. Each application supports its own object model,
so the code you write is completely different. Therefore, we start
this chapter with a cursory look at some of the popular Active
Scripting applications from Microsoft, showing sample VBScript
alongside Python code. We won't discuss any of these
applications in detail, just enough for you to understand how to use
Python in their environments. We then focus on how Active Scripting
works and Python's implementation of Active Scripting. These
will give you enough grounding so you can use Python inside any
Active Scripting application armed with only the documentation for
the application and its VBScript or JScript samples.</P>



<P>Finally, we take a look at adding Active Scripting support to your
Python application. This lets your application's customers use
any language they choose. You will be amazed at how simple it is to
do from Python.</p>
