<FONT><h2>Colophon</h2>


<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>



<P>The animal on the cover of <I>Python Programming on
Win32</I> is a caiman (caiman crocodilus). One of 23 species
of crocodiles, the caiman lives primarily in the wetlands, flood
plains, and river areas of Mexico and South America. They prefer
less-traveled, low waters. Their diet consists of insects, fish, and
small mammals.</P>



<p>A female builds a nest in the ground or in covered vegetation,
and lays around 20 to 25 eggs in the late summer. Several females may
share a nest, to help their young survive. After 90 days' gestation,
the young hatch. They reach full maturity at around four to seven
years of age. A caiman grows to be about four to six feet long.</p>



<p>Caiman young are yellow in color, while adults have a more
olive-green color. In the past, caimans have been in danger due to
habitat destruction, hunting, and pet trade, but some conservation
efforts have helped bring their numbers up in recent years.</p>



<P>Mary Anne Weeks Mayo was the production editor for
<I>Python Programming on Win32</I>. Colleen Gorman
copyedited the book, and Jeff Holcomb and Jane Ellin provided quality
control. Judy Hoer provided production assistance. Robert Romano and
Rhon Porter created the illustrations using Adobe Photoshop 4 and
Macromedia FreeHand 7.  Brenda Miller wrote the index.</P>



<p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a
19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover
layout was produced with Quark XPress 3.32 using the ITC Garamond
font.</p>



<p>Kathleen Wilson produced the cover layout with Quark XPress 3.3
using Adobe's ITC Garamond font. The interior layouts were designed by
Edie Freedman and Nancy Priest, with modifications by Alicia Cech, and
implemented in FrameMaker 5.5 by Mike Sierra. The text and heading
fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book. This colophon was
written by Nicole Arigo.</p>
