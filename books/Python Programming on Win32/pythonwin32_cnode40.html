<FONT><h2>Chapter
5. Introduction to COM</h2>


<p>
<a NAME="idx500"></a>In this chapter, we provide an
introduction to using the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) from
Python. We will present enough introductory material so you can
understand the key concepts and some simple examples that use Python
and COM.</p>



<p>COM is a technique for using or publishing objects, regardless of the
language they were implemented in. Any COM-aware environment uses a
COM object in a consistent and reliable way; you need to know nothing
about how the object is implemented.</p>



<P>COM has grown from humble beginnings. Its lineage can be traced
through the <A NAme="idx501"></a> <a NAME="idx502"></a>Object Linking and Embedding
(OLE) technology that first appeared in the Microsoft Windows 3.x
family. The first version of Visual Basic included a technology known
as <a name="idx503"></a> <a name="idx504"></a>Visual Basic
Extensions, or VBXs. Microsoft started merging these technologies
into
<a name="idx505"></a>OLE2,
which was soon renamed COM. Since then, the Microsoft marketing
machine has begun to refer to the technology as ActiveX, although COM
remains the mnemonic of choice in the Windows development world.
Recently, COM has been extended with the ability to distribute
objects across a network, and these extensions are known as
Distributed COM, or <a nAME="idx506"></A> <A NaME="idx507"></a>DCOM. Over time, the
term DCOM will slowly vanish as the capabilities it offers are
considered a standard part of COM. Microsoft is already hard at work
on the next major revision of COM, currently known as
<A NAme="idx508"></A>COM+. Although COM+
isn't discussed in this book, all the existing COM concepts
will remain for the foreseeable future.</P>



<P>Throughout the rest of the book, we present a number of examples that
use Python and COM, so the intent of this chapter is to give you the
groundwork to follow the samples. In <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</A>, we
expand on all these concepts, explaining the Python COM support in
greater detail.</P>
