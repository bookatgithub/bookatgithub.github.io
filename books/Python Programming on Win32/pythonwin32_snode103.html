<h3>13.1
DAO, ADO, ODBC, OLEDB, and Other GBFLAs</h3>


<p>Nowhere in the computing world do acronyms fly so thick and so fast
as with databases (GBFLAs stands for Great Big Five-Letter Acronyms).
Microsoft has produced a bewildering array of data-access APIs over
the years. For most applications, these will be the primary means of
getting at your data. We'll run through the common ones and try
to put them in context. If you are an experienced Windows database
developer, you may wish to skip ahead to the section, <a href="pythonwin32_snode105.html">Section 13.3</a>, later in this chapter.</p>




<h4>13.1.1
Proprietary APIs</h4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx1257"></a>
<a NAME="idx1258"></a>Vendors of
client/server systems such as Oracle and Sybase generally provide a
CD of <a name="idx1259"></a>client software to be installed on
any PC that needs to connect to one of their servers. This software
often includes a tool to keep track of the various database servers
on the network, a <a name="idx1260"></a>
<a name="idx1261"></a>custom
network protocol on top of TCP/IP, various administrative
applications, command-line SQL clients, and various programming
interfaces to the database.</p>



<p>At the lowest level, C libraries and/or preprocessors are included to
allow C programs to execute queries against a database. Python
modules have been written around these libraries for (at least)
Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Solid, MySQL, and Interbase.</P>



<P>Proprietary APIs often give the fastest connections and allow access
to proprietary features of a particular database. However, SQL is
supposed to be a standard, and users want the freedom to switch
databases without unreasonable pain, so Microsoft has been working on
standard interfaces to databases for many years.</P>







<H4>13.1.2
Open Database Connectivity</H4>


<P>
<a NAmE="idx1262"></A> <a NAME="idx1263"></A>Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) is a standardized
<A name="idx1264"></A>API
that provides <A NAme="idx1265"></a>universal database access and is
available on all Windows systems.<fONT Size="1"><sUP><A Href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></sup></font>
 It consists of a DLL that exposes standard functions to
connect to and query databases, and a piece of software to manage
connections. Each database vendor still has to provide the necessary
software to connect to their own database, as well as an ODBC driver
that allows it to fit into the ODBC framework. Click Start <img border="0" aLIGN="absmiddle" WIdTH="20" hEIgHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" Alt="figs/U2192.gif">

<p>Each machine provides a list of named <a namE="idx1266"></A>data sources; these can be configured
for a single user or available to the whole system. Clicking Add or
Configure leads to a set of dialogs specific to the database vendor;
for example, for a local Microsoft Access database you essentially
just select the file to use. Once a data source has been defined, any
of your programs can connect to that data source by name using ODBC.</P>



<P>This architecture has some enormous benefits. With care, it's
possible to start prototyping with a data source named
"<A NaME="idx1267"></a>Accounts" on a local
Access database, and then switch to using (for example) a remote
Oracle server with the same structure just by changing the
configuration.</P>



<P>Because the capabilities of databases vary so widely, the ODBC API
offers a wide range of functions at three levels of compliance. Level
1 compliance is the absolute minimum and is used for things like
providing SQL access to text files; Level 2 is generally regarded as
the minimum feature set for anything that is sold as a relational
database.</p>



<P>ODBC will be our main tool for working with databases on Windows.
We'll go through some examples later.</P>







<H4>13.1.3
Data Access Objects, JET, and Access</H4>


<P>Microsoft <A name="idx1268"></A> <A NAme="idx1269"></a>Access is the
world's most popular desktop relational database, used
extensively for individual and small business systems. Although it
can be used on a network, it isn't a proper client/server
system. If five users share a database across a network, there are
five separate applications all opening and closing the same data
file. Access doesn't scale up to high volumes of users.</p>



<P>From the beginning, Access was split into a GUI (what you see when
you start Access) and an engine called Jet. The
<A NAme="idx1270"></a>Data Access Object (DAO)
hierarchy was an object hierarchy for getting at the
<a NAME="idx1271"></a>Jet engine; it
contained objects to represent databases, tables, relationships
between tables, fields, and queries. It was originally accessible
only from Access and Visual Basic. The ability to rapidly build
database applications was one of the key factors in Visual Basic
3's huge popularity. With the arrival of Office 95, the DAO
hierarchy became a full-fledged set of COM servers, allowing any
COM-enabled language to open databases.</p>



<p>The popularity of this development model rapidly led to a demand to
connect the same applications to client/server databases, and the DAO
hierarchy was extended allowing it to use ODBC connections under the
hood as well as Access databases. DAO now provides a comprehensive
COM interface to a wide range of databases. It is available on all
Windows systems with <a name="idx1272"></a>Office 95 or 97.</p>







<h4>13.1.4
Remote Data Objects</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1273"></a>
<a nAME="idx1274"></A>Remote Data Objects (RDO) is another COM
object hierarchy, layered on top of ODBC instead of the Jet engine.
When you use DAO to get at an ODBC database, you are actually using
RDO objects. RDO is popular among corporate developers because it
offers support for features such as prepared statements and calling
stored procedures. The most visible manifestation of RDO is the
<A NaME="idx1275"></a> <A NaME="idx1276"></A>Remote Data Control in Visual Basic,
which helped to remedy the truly appalling performance of the Data
Control when operating on remote databases.<FONt sizE="1"><SUP><a hreF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A></SUp></fonT>
 RDO is stable and works well, but is not as popular as
DAO. It is unlikely to be developed further.</P>


<BLockquote><font size="1">
<p clasS="footnote">
<SUP><A NaME="FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></SUp>
The Data
Control allows you to build a database form by setting a few
properties and linking text boxes to database fields. It queries the
database at runtime about the kinds of fields available in the tables
to which it's bound; this works fine with Jet, which has the
information readily available, but generates unbelievable traffic
over a client/server connection. We've watched it by logging
ODBC calls, and each data control makes a separate connection; one
application might have 10 or 12 database connections open.</P>

<h4>13.1.5
OLEDB</h4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx1277"></a>OLEDB (which probably
stands for Object Linking and Embedding Database, but as far as we
can tell has never been written out in full before now) is intended
as a successor to ODBC. ODBC allowed connection to relational
databases; OLEDB extends this to allow querying of arbitrary
<a nAME="idx1278"></A>data
providers such as hierarchical filesystems, mailboxes in Microsoft
Exchange, text files, and nonrelational mainframes. It contains
functionality to let you determine the capabilities of a provider at
runtime. Many database vendors have now written OLEDB providers, and
it can work through ODBC for those that have not. OLEDB consists of a
wide range of low-level COM interfaces, and OLEDB programming is
usually done by people writing database drivers; Microsoft provides
an easy-to-use layer above it, as we will see next.</p>







<h4>13.1.6
ActiveX Data Objects</h4>


<p>By now you should be sufficiently attuned to Microsoft terminology to
realize that terms using <i>Active </i>are (a) invented
by their marketing department and devoid of precise technical
meanings and (b) probably something to do with COM.
<a name="idx1279"></a> <a name="idx1280"></a>ActiveX Data Objects
(ADO) is not a new technology, but simply an easy-to-use COM object
hierarchy on top of OLEDB. It is bundled with
<a naME="idx1281"></A>
<A NAmE="idx1282"></A>Visual Basic and Visual C++ 5.0 and
higher; look in the MakePy window for Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects
Library 2.0. It looks superficially similar to DAO and RDO but offers
vastly greater capabilities under the hood and is thoroughly geared
to the needs of client/server systems. Microsoft has stated that they
will put no effort into further enhancements of RDO, DAO, and ODBC
(although they are committed to supporting ODBC for the long haul),
so ADO sounds like the COM interface of the future. Here are some of
the enhancements offered:</p>



<UL>
<lI><P>
<A NAMe="idx1283"></a>A
programmer can trap
<a nAME="idx1284"></A>events before or after commands
are executed.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>A <A Name="idx1285"></a>command
object wraps stored procedures and simplifies setting parameters.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>ADO exposes objects that wrap up the <a name="idx1286"></a>data
definition language of a data store, meaning you can write code to
create and modify tables and indexes, which works against a variety
of underlying databases, even nonrelational ones.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ADO supports <a name="idx1287"></a>hierarchical recordsets, which
consist of prejoined master and detail recordsets.</p>
</LI>
<LI><P>
<A nAMe="idx1288"></A>Disconnected recordsets and
<A nAME="idx1289"></A>batch updates are perhaps the most
exciting features. An application for a salesman with a laptop could
connect to a database before going to fetch a recordset. The
recordset can be kept open after the connection to the database is
closed and saved to and from files on disk. On return, it can be
resynchronized with the database. ADO takes care of the persistence
and of keeping track of what has changed.</P>
</Li>
</ul>
<p>The last three features will probably be exciting for Visual Basic
developers, since that language doesn't let you get hold of
data as directly as Python; database data generally lives in a
recordset throughout the life of a program, and so, is less relevant
to us. Experienced SQL developers prefer to write their own
<TT CLass="monofont">CREATE TABLE</tT> statements by hand and are quite
happy without an object layer in the way. Hierarchical data shaping
and persistence are simple in Python, as you will see shortly.</P>







<H4>13.1.7
So What's Worth Using?</H4>


<p>
<a naME="idx1290"></A>
<A name="idx1291"></a>ODBC <a name="idx1292"></a>is <a name="idx1293"></a>our <a namE="idx1294"></A>preferred interface technology. It is
widely supported, here for the long haul, and offers all the features
serious database developers require. There is an ODBC module included
in the PythonWin distribution, and two enhanced ones available for
download, which we examine next. As you will see, these provide the
fastest and simplest ways of getting data out of a database and into
Python variables. DAO is of interest because it is a standard part of
Office and in such wide use; it may be relevant if you are dealing
specifically with Access databases. However, ADO seems set to take
over and offers significant benefits, as well as a fairly
straightforward transition from DAO. We show some examples of all
three in the next section, but we'll concentrate mainly on ODBC
for our more advanced examples.</P>
