<h3>13.7
A Three-Tier Architecture with Business Objects</h3>


<p><i></I>
<A NAme="idx1460"></a> <a NAME="idx1461"></a>For our final example of what
Python can do with data, we'll look at how Python supports
building a three-tier client/server architecture. This will be a
fairly straightforward example, as we did a lot of the groundwork in
the last section.</p>



<p>Simple <a NAME="idx1462"></a>database applications have two tiers:
<a name="idx1463"></a>database and
<a name="idx1464"></a>user
interface. A dialog to maintain client details might perform a
<tt class="monofont">SELECT</tT> query to get all the details of a customer
and store those details in the user interface; either directly in
text boxes, or in variables stored in the same form or module. When
the data has been changed, the system performs an
<TT CLAsS="monofont">UPDATE</Tt> query to store the results.</P>



<P>A <a NAME="idx1465"></A>three-tier architecture creates a
<Tt claSS="monofont">Customer</TT>
<a namE="idx1466"></A> class to hold the information, and
provides functions to load customers from the database and store them
back to it. The GUI layer gets data from the
<TT clasS="monofont">Customer</TT> objects. Objects in the middle layer are
often known as <I>business
objects</i>
<a name="idx1467"></a>, because they model things in the
business or problem domain, rather than systems objects like database
connections, or GUI objects like queries. If you are writing
object-oriented programs, you're already at work on the
business objects.</p>



<p>Three-tier also describes network partitioning. With modern
distributed-object technologies such as COM and CORBA (and some much
lighter alternatives like Python's
<tt class="monofont">RemoteCall</tt> package), it's easy to run the
database on one machine, the business objects on another, and the GUI
on a third. It's highly likely that your
<tt cLASS="monofont">Customer</TT> object will pop up in many parts of the
application, so the three-tier approach is much better for all but
the simplest application. There's a lot of marketing hype about
this. We'll just focus on the logical aspects.</p>



<P>Real-life databases need lots of tables to represent a business
object such as a customer or an invoice. Similarly, the objects in
memory are bound to have references to other objects and lists of
subobjects; a <Tt CLaSS="monofont">Customer</TT> object may provide access
to a list of invoices, and a list of correspondence items received.
There is a lot of work involved in building class hierarchies and
tables to match each other and code to fetch and store the right
records at the right time. Furthermore, every change in the database
may necessitate changing and recompiling your business object code,
and vice versa.</P>



<P>Not with Python! Python's dynamic nature makes it possible to
dramatically reduce the dependencies between database and business
objects.</p>




<h4>13.7.1
Dynamic Attributes</h4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx1468"></a>We saw in
<a href="pythonwin32_cnode49.html">Chapter 6</A><i>,</i> that Python
objects can hold any attributes you want, in addition to those
defined for the class. Any Python object's attributes and
methods are held in a hidden, internal dictionary. And we have just
learned how to fetch those!</p>



<p>The simplest way to construct an object from a database is to use an
almost-empty class. Remember you can add attributes at runtime to a
Python class as follows:</P>



<PRE class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; class DumbDbRecord:
...     pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; r1 = DumbDbRecord()
&gt;&gt;&gt; r1.CustomerID = 1234
&gt;&gt;&gt; r1.Name = 'Pythonics Inc.'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>It would be easy to examine a database cursor and add all attributes
to an object such as this, creating a handy database record object
with a clean syntax. However, this approach carries a weakness. You
presumably will want to write objects that have attributes and
methods important to the functioning of the program, and to keep them
separate from data fetched from the database. We've therefore
defined a class that can accept a dictionary of fields and values and
keep them separate from its own attributes.</p>



<p>A helpful piece of Python magic is the ability to trap
<a name="idx1469"></a>
<a namE="idx1470"></A>attribute access. We saw in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode49.html">Chapter 6</A> that a Python object can monitor attempts to
set or get its attributes. If you ask an instance of this next class
for an attribute it can't find, it goes and checks in the
dictionary it got from the database:</P>



<pRE cLASS="monofont">class Record:
    #holds arbitrary database data
    def __init__(self):
        self._dbdata = {}
        
    def loadFromDict(self, aDict):
        "accept all attributes in the dictionary"
        self._dbdata.update(aDict)

    def getData(self):
        return self._dbdata.copy()
        
    def pp(self):
        "pretty-print my database data"
        pprint(self._dbdata)
        
    def __getattr__(self, key):
        """This is called if the object lacks the attribute.
        If the key is not found, it raises an error in the
        same way that the attribute access would were no
        __getattr__ method present.  """
        return self._dbdata[key]</PRe>


<p>Now you can use it to represent any kind of object you want and
access the variables with the most natural syntax:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import laundry
&gt;&gt;&gt; pc_dict = {'Name':'Yosemite', 'Maker':'Carrera','Speed':266}
&gt;&gt;&gt; rec = laundry.Record()
&gt;&gt;&gt; rec.loadFromDict(pc_dict)
&gt;&gt;&gt; rec.Maker
'Carrera'
&gt;&gt;&gt; rec.Speed
266
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pRE>


<P>It's easy to extend <Tt claSS="monofont">DataSet</TT> to get a list of
objects rather than dictionaries, and your data-manipulation code
will be extremely readable. Furthermore, you can derive many of the
<tt class="monofont">INSERT</tt> and <tt class="monofont">UPDATE</tt> statements
you need automatically.</p>



<p>If you use this class and populate it with the results of a query,
whenever someone adds a database field to the Customers table, your
objects acquire the new data attribute automatically. If someone
deletes a database field the program needs, your code will need
fixing (Python is powerful, but not telepathic) but your model can be
made reasonably robust against the deletion on information fields as
well.<fONT SIZe="1"><SUp><A HrEF="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</A></SUP></font>
</P>


<BLOckquOTE><Font sIZE="1">
<P class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a></sup>
Some Python GUI libraries, such as Tkinter,
make it easy to build dialogs dynamically as well, so that the edit
boxes displayed on a customer dialog could also depend on the
available data.</p>
</fonT></BLOCKqUOtE>









<H4>13.7.2
Lazy Fetches</h4>


<P>The examples in this chapter used two tables, one of clients and one
of invoices, with a master-detail relationship. In terms of objects,
you'd say that a client has a list of related invoices.
However, it might be expensive to fetch these every time when a user
might want to see them only some of the time.</P>



<P>Let's implement a <I>lazy fetch</I> to get the
data on demand. This <Tt claSS="monofont">Customer</TT> class inherits from
our <tt clASS="monofont">Record</Tt> class. Given a database connection, it
fetches its main attributes when explicitly asked, but the invoice
list is retrieved on demand:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">class Customer(Record):
    def __getattr__(self, key):
        #trap attempts to fetch the list of invoices
        if key == 'Invoices':
            self.fetchInvoices()
            return self.Invoices
        else:
            #call the inherited method
            return Record.__getattr__(self, key)

    def fetch(self, conn, key):
        self.conn = conn
        cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Clients \
                        WHERE ClientID = '%s'" % key)
        dicts = DataSetFromCursor(cursor).asDicts()
        assert len(dicts) == 1, 'Error fetching data!'
        self.loadFromDict(dicts[0])
        
    def fetchInvoices(self):
        #presumes an attribute pointing to the database
        cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Invoices \ 
                      WHERE ClientID = '%s'" % self.ClientID)
        ds = DataSetFromCursor(cursor)
        self.Invoices = ds.asObjects()</pre>


<p>Using this class is straightforward:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; c = laundry.Customer()
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.fetch(conn, 'MEGAWAD')   # assume an open connection
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.CompanyName              # see if we got data...
'MegaWad Investments'
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.pp()                     # let's see all the fields
{'Address1': '1 St. Fredericks-Le-Grand',
 'Address2': 'London EC1A 8AB',
 'Address3': None,
 'Address4': None,
 'ClientID': 'MEGAWAD',
 'CompanyName': 'MegaWad Investments',
 'ContactName': 'Hachiro Kobayashi'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(c.Invoices)            # trigger another fetch
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.Invoices[0].Hours       # access a child object 
42.0
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>The example so far only fetches data. The <tt CLASS="monofont">__setattr_
_()</Tt>
<A NaME="idx1471"></a> method lets you trap
attempts to set attributes in an analogous way, which you can use to
update field lists, type-check arguments, and keep track of whether
an object has changed and so needs updates posted back to the
database.</P>



<P>It's possible in Python to build an even more general
data-driven object framework, where you declared some mapping of
objects to database rows, along with the names of classes to use and
the relationships between database tables, and let Python build an
entire web of objects on demand.<I></I>
