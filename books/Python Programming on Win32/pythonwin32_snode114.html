<h3>14.1
SMTP and POP3</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1486"></a> <a naME="idx1487"></A> <A name="idx1488"></A>
<A NAme="idx1489"></a>SMTP is an acronym for Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol. This is an Internet standard, specified in
<a name="idx1490"></a>RFC-821, and as its
name implies, is a protocol for transferring mail messages. When an
SMTP server receives a piece of mail, it does one of two things:
forwards the email to a host closer to the intended recipient, or if
the recipient is local, places the email in the recipient's
mailbox. Thus, SMTP provides a technique for putting messages in a
mailbox, but it doesn't define a technique for retrieving
existing messages from a mailbox. To this end, the Post Office
Protocol, Version 3 (POP3) has been designed, as specified in
RFC-1725. Its explicit purpose is to allow remote access to a mailbox
managed on a remote computer.</p>



<p>In practice, this means that SMTP can send Internet email, and POP3
can retrieve Internet email.</p>



<p>As is common for Internet protocols, both mail protocols use a simple
conversation between a client and a server. This conversation is
"<a name="idx1491"></a>line-based" (meaning all
commands and responses are sent as complete lines) and works
exclusively with 7-bit ASCII data. Each protocol defines its own
special command and response sequence to support its various options.</p>



<p>The mail messages handled by both these protocols must be formatted
as specified in various RFCs, starting with RFC-822, to the latest,
which is RFC-1521. In a nutshell, these RFCs define the format of the
<I>message header</I>
<A NAMe="idx1492"></A> (a list of headers for the message,
including the subject, recipient information, etc.), and the
<I>message body</i>
<A NaME="idx1493"></A>. The message body must consist of 7-bit
ASCII and may optionally include a number of different sections.
These sections typically encode binary attachments or alternative
renderings of the message text. Messages with multiple sections are
typically referred to as <A NAme="idx1494"></a>
<a NAME="idx1495"></a>Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions (MIME) messages. Unfortunately, MIME is a complex
beast and beyond the scope of this chapter. Python does support
various MIME standards, but using and packing everything into an
email message is not for the faint hearted. If you have this
requirement, and Microsoft Exchange or a slightly higher-level email
system is available, you should consider using that.</p>




<h4>14.1.1
Sending an SMTP Message</h4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx1496"></a>
<a NAME="idx1497"></a>To begin, we'll use Python to
send a simple message using the SMTP protocol. Our message will
contain the minimum number of message headers, a plain ASCII message
body, and no attachments.</p>



<p>To assist in this task, we'll use the Python module
<tt class="monofont">smtplib</tt>
<a name="idx1498"></a>. This module contains a single class,
<tt cLASS="monofont">SMTP</TT>
<a NAmE="idx1499"></A>, that manages the connection with the
SMTP server and provides useful methods for interacting with the
server.</p>



<P>Sending a simple message using SMTP is so simple it's not worth
writing a sample source file for this purpose; you can do it at the
interactive window. The <TT CLAss="monofont">SMTP</tt> class provides the
following method:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">bad_addresses = sendmail( <TT Class="monofont"><I>from</I></TT>, <tt class="monofont"><i>to</i></tt>, <tt class="monofont"><i>message</i></tT> )</PRE>


<DL>
<dT>
<FoNT cOLOR="#990000"><TT clasS="monofont"><I>from</I></Tt></fonT></DT>
<Dd>
<p>A string with the address of the sender.</p>
</dD>
<DT>
<Font color="#990000"><tt class="monofont"><i>to</i></tt></foNT></DT>
<DD>
<p>A list of strings, one for each recipient.</P>
</Dd>
<DT>
<fONT COLor="#990000"><tt CLASs="monofont"><i>message</i></tT></FONt></dt>
<dD>
<P>A message as a string formatted as specified in the various RFCs.</P>
</Dd>
</dl>


<p>So all you need is the message itself, a list of recipients, and your
own email address.</p>



<p>As per <a name="idx1500"></a>RFC-822, the
format of the message is simple. It consists of a list of message
headers, followed by a blank line, followed by the message body. For
this demonstration, you can set up a message with the following code:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; msg="Subject: Hi from Python\n\nHello."</PRE>


<P>Define the subject of the message as "Hi from Python" and
the body as "Hello."</P>



<P>Next, define a variable with your email address and SMTP host:</p>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; address="MHammond@skippinet.com.au"
&gt;&gt;&gt; host="mail-hub"</PRE>


<P>And send the message to yourself:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import smtplib
&gt;&gt;&gt; s=smtplib.SMTP(host)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.sendmail(address, [address], msg)
{}</pre>


<P>The result from this function is a dictionary of email addresses in
the <I>to</I> list that failed; the dictionary is keyed
by the email address, with the error message as the value. In this
example you received an empty dictionary, so everything went OK. See
the <Tt claSS="monofont">smtplib</TT> module documentation for more
information on error handling.</p>







<h4>14.1.2
Receiving via POP3</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1501"></a> <a name="idx1502"></a>POP3 downloads messages from a remote
mailbox. As we discussed previously, SMTP is used typically to send
Internet email messages, and POP3 receives them.</p>



<p>Like most Internet protocols, POP3 uses a
<a naME="idx1503"></A>line-based communications
protocol, and also like most Internet protocols, you will find a
Python module designed to ease working with that protocol; in this
case the Python module is
<TT ClASs="monofont">poplib</TT>
<a NAME="idx1504"></A>.</P>



<p>Before delving into a discussion of POP3, it is worth noting that an
improved protocol known as <a naME="idx1505"></A>Internet Message Access
Protocol (IMAP) has been designed. Although this fixes many of the
shortcomings in the POP3 protocol, it's not used as widely as
POP3. Therefore, we will discuss using POP3 to ensure the code works
on the widest possible range of mail servers. If you need to
investigate using the IMAP protocol, you should view the module
<Tt claSS="monofont">imaplib</TT>
<a namE="idx1506"></A> and its associated documentation.</P>



<P>There are three steps to establishing a connection to a POP3 mailbox:</p>



<ol type="1">
<li><p>
<a name="idx1507"></a> <a name="idx1508"></A>Connect to the server by creating a
<TT CLAsS="monofont">poplib.POP3()</Tt>
<A NaME="idx1509"></A> instance, specifying the hostname.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>Send the mailbox account name, using the
<tT CLAss="monofont">user()</tt>
<A NAMe="idx1510"></a> <a nAME="idx1511"></A> method.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Send the mailbox password using the
<tt class="monofont">pass_()</tt>
<a name="idx1512"></a> method (<TT CLASs="monofont">pass</TT> is a
<a NAmE="idx1513"></A>reserved word
in Python, hence the trailing underscore).</P>
</LI>
</Ol>

<p>You now have a valid connection, and the mailbox is locked. While the
mailbox is locked, no other connections are possible, so it's
important to unlock the mailbox when you're done using the
<tt CLASs="monofont">quit()</tt>
<a NAME="idx1514"></a> method. If you don't unlock the
mailbox, other mail clients (such as your regular email client)
won't be able to connect until the connection times out, which
may take some time. It would be appropriate to use a Python
<tt cLASS="monofont">finally</tt>
<a name="idx1515"></a> block for this purpose, as the example
will show.</p>



<p>POP3 messages are numbered from 1-n, where n is the number of
messages currently in the mailbox. Obviously, these message numbers
are not unique and are valid only for the given session. So the first
step to reading the mailbox is to determine the number of messages in
the <a name="idx1516"></a>mailbox using the
<tt claSS="monofont">stat()</TT>
<A NaME="idx1517"></a> method. Then you can request each
message by number. For the first example, don't bother looping
over all the messages, but, instead, just look at the first message:</P>



<PrE CLASS="monofont"># DumpPop.py - Dumps the first message in a POP3 mailbox.
import sys
import poplib

def DumpAPopMessage(host, user, password):
    # Establish a connection to the POP server.
    a = poplib.POP3(host)
    # Note we print the server response, although not necessary!
    print a.user(user)
    print a.pass_(password)
    # The mailbox is now locked - ensure we unlock it!
    try:
        (numMsgs, totalSize) = a.stat()
        if numMsgs == 0:
            print "Sorry - there are no messages in the mailbox"
        else:
            (server_msg, body, octets) = a.retr(1)
            print "Server Message:", server_msg
            print "Number of Octets:", octets
            print "Message body:"
            for line in body:
                print line
    finally:
        print a.quit()

if __name__=='__main__':
    if len(sys.argv)&lt;4:
        print "Usage:", sys.argv[0], "host username password"
    else:
        DumpAPopMessage(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3])</pre>


<p>As you can see, the example expects you to pass the hostname, the
username, and password on the command line. You can test the script
from the command prompt, as the following output shows:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt;DumpPop.py pop-server mhammond topsecret

Hello
+OK m5.bigpond.net.au POP3 server closing connection

C:\Scripts&gt;</PRE>


<p>This is the same message you sent previously. Notice all the headers
this message now has; even though you specified only a few, the mail
transport system has added many more. The output shown has had many
headers removed for brevity.</p>



<p>At this point you may start to get a little worried. Looking at the
code, you can see the message is returned as a list of lines, but
many of those lines are headers. Worse, some of the headers are split
over multiple lines (as supported by the relevant
<a NAME="idx1518"></a>RFC). Does this mean
you need to understand all this before doing anything useful?</p>



<p>Fortunately, Python has library support for parsing and using data of
this format. The most basic support can be found in the
<tt class="monofont">rfc822.Message</tt>
<a name="idx1519"></a> class, but the
<tt cLASS="monofont">mimetools</TT>
<a NAmE="idx1520"></A> module supports an extension to this
class that supports the various MIME extensions (as described
earlier). Since <a NAME="idx1521"></A>MIME is an extension to the basic
standard, you can safely use it even for non-MIME messages.</P>



<p>A slight complication is that the
<tt cLASS="monofont">mimetools.Message()</tt>
<a nAME="idx1522"></A> class expects to receive a
<a namE="idx1523"></A>
<A Name="idx1524"></a>file object from which it obtains its
data, rather than a list of lines! The
<tt class="monofont">StringIO</tt>
<a name="idx1525"></a> <a nAME="idx1526"></A> (or <TT cLAsS="monofont">cStringIO</Tt>) module
can make a file object from a string, but there is a list of strings.
The simplest solution is to join the list back into a huge string and
feed that into <TT CLASs="monofont">cStringIO</tt>.</p>



<P>Once you create <TT Class="monofont">mimetools.Message()</TT>, all the
headers are read, and the file is positioned at the start of the
body. You can then use the various methods to examine the headers.
Depending on the message content, you can either read the rest of the
file to obtain the body or use some of the MIME-specific features to
process the various sections.</P>



<P>You can now modify the example to take advantage of this class. Loop
over all messages in the mailbox and examine the Subject header for
the test message. When you find the message, print the message body
and delete the message.</p>



<p>The significant additions to the new example are:</p>



<uL>
<LI><P>A loop to examine all the messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using <tt class="monofont">cStringIO</tt> to create a file object as
discussed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Examine the Subject header of each message using the
<TT CLASs="monofont">getheader()</TT> method.</p>
</LI>
<lI><P>Delete the message with the
<TT CLass="monofont">dele()</tT>
<A NAme="idx1527"></a> method of the POP3 session.</p>
