<h3>16.2
Server and Share Information</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1623"></a> <a naME="idx1624"></A>In
many administrative tasks, it's handy to be able to query and
change information about particular servers and the resources these
servers publish. Working with server and share information is
identical in concept to working with users and groups. Each function
defines an information level that determines the specific data
requested or being set.</P>




<h4>16.2.1
Querying Information About Servers</h4>


<p>Server information is provided by the
<tT CLAss="monofont">PySERVER_INFO_*</tt> structures, as defined in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode188.html">Appendix B</a>. <tt class="monofont">PySERVER_INFO_100</tt> provides
the lowest level of detail, so let's see what this includes.</p>



<p>First import the necessary modules and read the data for the server.
Then print the dictionary:</P>



<PRE CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32net, win32netcon
&gt;&gt;&gt; data=win32net.NetServerGetInfo(None, 100)
&gt;&gt;&gt; data
{'name': L'BOBCAT', 'platform_id': 500}</pRE>


<p>Notice the <TT CLASs="monofont">platform_id</tt> is 500. Windows defines
only two platform IDs, one for Windows NT and one for OS/2:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; win32netcon.SV_PLATFORM_ID_NT
500
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<P>My workstation is indeed an NT machine: what a relief!</p>



<p>You can also obtain a list of the Windows servers on your network
with the
<tt CLASs="monofont">win32net.NetServerEnum()</tt>
<a name="idx1625"></a> function.</p>



<pre class="monofont">entries, total, resume = win32net.NetServerEnum(<tt cLASS="monofont"><I>server</I></tT>, <Tt CLaSS="monofont"><I>level</I></TT>, serverTypes=
win32netcon.SV_TYPE_ALL, resume = 0, len=4096)</pre>


<dL>
<DT>
<Font cOLOR="#990000"><tt clASS="monofont"><I>server</i></tt></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the server to execute on or <tt class="monofont">None</tt> for
the current machine.</P>
</DD>
<DT>
<FoNT cOLoR="#990000"><TT CLAss="monofont"><i>level</i></TT></FOnt></dt>
<DD>
<P>An integer specifying the level of information requested.</P>
</dd>
<dt>
<FONT color="#990000"><font color="#990000"><span claSS="monofont">serverTypes</SPAN></fONt>
</FOnT></DT>
<DD>
<P>A bitmask of flags indicating the types of servers to list. <a href="pythonwin32_cnode188.html">Appendix B</A> lists common values for this flag.</P>
</Dd>
</dl>


<p>We don't discuss the <TT CLass="monofont">resume</tT> or
<TT Class="monofont">len</tt> parameters, or the result. Check the previous
example for <tt class="monofont">win32net.NetUserEnum()</tt> to see how to
use these enumerators.</p>







<h4>16.2.2
Working with Share Information</h4>


<p>Windows NT defines the concept of a
<i>share</i>
<A NAME="idx1626"></A>.
A share is a resource published by a machine designed for sharing
with multiple users. Shares are usually disk-based shares or
printers.</p>



<P>To obtain information about a share or to enumerate the shares
available on a Windows NT server, the
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">win32net.NetShare*()</TT>
<A Name="idx1627"></a> family of functions are
used, with <TT CLass="monofont">PySHARE_INFO_*</tT> as the corresponding
data structures. The process for shares is identical to the process
for working with users and servers, as we described previously.</P>



<P>For example, you can use the
<Tt claSS="monofont">win32net.NetShareEnum()</TT>
<a name="idx1628"></a> function to view the shares published
by a server. This function is almost identical to the other
enumerator functions described in this chapter, so you can use the
following code to read the first few shares at your local machine at
information level 0:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; data, total, resume = win32net.NetShareEnum(None, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for share in data:
...     print share['netname']
... 
... 
ADMIN$
IPC$
cdrom
C$
c_drive
l_drive
L$
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Note that you haven't looped calling the function, so you get
only the first few shares that may be available.</p>



<p>A new share can be created on a server using
<TT CLASs="monofont">win32net.NetShareAdd()</TT>. This function requires
data in information level 2, a <tT ClASS="monofont">PyNET_SHARE_INFO_2</TT>
structure. By referring to <A href="pythonwin32_cnode188.html">Appendix B</A>, you can find
the data necessary to create a share. The following code shows how to
create a share to the local <I>C:\TEMP</I> directory:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; data={}
&gt;&gt;&gt; data['netname']="TEMPSHARE"
&gt;&gt;&gt; data['type']=win32netcon.STYPE_DISKTREE
&gt;&gt;&gt; data['path']="C:\\TEMP"
&gt;&gt;&gt; data['max_uses']=-1
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32net.NetShareAdd(None, 2, data)</pre>


<p>The only nonobvious part may be the <TT CLass="monofont">max_uses</tt>
element. If you left this at zero, no users could connect to your
share. The Win32 documentation states that this should be set to -1
to allow for unlimited uses.</p>







<h4>16.2.3
User and Share Sample</h4>


<p>We now present a fairly advanced sample of using some of these
administrative tools in a real-world scenario.</p>



<p>The problem is that our company has just merged with another
medium-sized company. The merger means 250 new user accounts need to
be created on the network. This is clearly too many to perform
manually when there is a tool such as Python available. It's
not a problem to get a text file with the names of the new users, but
you need a way to automate the process. The requirements for creating
the new users are to:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>Create a new NT user with a default password that must be changed at
first logon.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Create a home directory for the new user with the user information
reflecting this as their home directory.</P>
</LI>
<Li><P>Create a new share for the user's home directory with the
appropriate default permissions. Windows NT also supports connecting
the user's home directory to a drive letter, so you need to set
the user info to nominate <A tARgET="_blank" HREF="P_3A">P:</a> to
connect to this share at logon.</p>
</li>
</UL>
<P>Of course, this is still a contrived example. Any real-world job will
have additional requirements when creating many new users; for
example, creating an email account for each new user. In addition,
the error-handling requirements depend on the particular task at
hand. To this end, and to keep the size of the sample code down, no
error handling exists at all. Notwithstanding these restrictions, you
should still find the sample valuable when developing your own
customized scripts.</P>



<p>Before jumping into the code, there are a few things worth mentioning:</p>



<ul>
<LI><P>The requirements state you should specify the home directory as
<A targET="_blank" HRef="P_3A">P:</a> and set the password as
expired when creating the user. Looking in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode188.html">Appendix B</a>, you'll see that you must use
information level 3 (<tt class="monofont">PyUSER_INFO_3</tt>) to obtain
access to this information. Creating a user at this information level
requires you to also set the <tt cLASS="monofont">primary_group_id</TT>
element to a default value.</p>
</LI>
<lI><P>
<a NAME="idx1629"></A>
<A name="idx1630"></A>The requirements state
that the share must have special security settings. This requires the
use of information level 502 (<TT Class="monofont">PySHARE_INFO_502</TT>).
The directory is created without special security. If necessary, you
could use <TT clasS="monofont">win32file.CreateDirectory()</TT>, passing a
security object similar to that used for the share.</P>
</li>
<li><p>The handling of the NT security objects is not covered in detail in
this book; for further information on Windows NT security, refer to
the Windows NT documentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unlike local groups, new users are automatically added to the domain
users group when they are created. Therefore, it's unnecessary
to add the user to any additional groups when this code is run
against a Windows NT domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should also provide some code to delete the new users. This is
particularly helpful when developing and testing the script; you can
delete the users created by the previous run, then re-create them
with different settings.</p>
</li>
</uL>
<P>The following <A NAMe="idx1631"></A>code is quite large by Python
standards—just over 100 lines, including comments and blank
lines:</P>
