<h3>17.2
Native File Manipulation: The win32file Module</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1686"></a> <a naME="idx1687"></A>There are times when the standard Python
file objects can't meet your requirements, and you need to use
the Windows API to manipulate files. This can happen in a number of
situations, such as:</P>



<ul>
<li><P>You need to read or write data to or from a Windows pipe.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>You need to set custom Windows security on a file you are creating.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You need to perform advanced techniques for performance reasons, such
as "Overlapped" operations or using completion ports.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<P>Python file objects are integrated closely with Python. You should
use the <Tt CLaSS="monofont">win32file</TT> module only when standard Python
file objects can't meet your requirements. Using the
<TT clasS="monofont">win32file</TT> module is a good deal more complex than
using native Python files.</P>

<h4>17.2.1
Opening and Creating Files</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1688"></a>
<a name="idx1689"></a>The
<tt cLASS="monofont">win32file.CreateFile()</TT>
<a NAmE="idx1690"></A> function opens or creates standard
files, returning a handle to the file. Standard files come in many
flavors, including <a NAME="idx1691"></A>
<A name="idx1692"></A>synchronous
files (where read or write operations don't return until the
operation has completed); <A NAme="idx1693"></a>
<a NAME="idx1694"></a>asynchronous
(or overlapped I/O) files, where read and write operations return
immediately; and <a naME="idx1695"></A>
<A name="idx1696"></a>temporary
files that are automatically deleted when the handle is closed. Files
may also be opened requesting that Windows not cache any file
operations, that no buffering is performed, etc. All the variations
that <tt class="monofont">CreateFile()</tt> can use are too numerous to list
here. For full details, please see the Windows API documentation for
<tt class="monofont">CreateFile()</TT>.</P>



<P>The <TT cLAsS="monofont">CreateFile()</Tt> function takes the following
parameters:</P>



<UL>
<LI><P>Name of the file</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Integer indicating the type of access requested on the file</P>
</Li>
<li><p>Integer-sharing options for the file</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>Security attributes for the new file or <tt CLASs="monofont">None</tt></p>
</li>
<li><p>A flag, indicating what action to take depending on if the file exists</p>
</li>
<li><p>A set of flags and attributes for the file itself</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another file to act as a template or <TT CLASs="monofont">None</TT></p>
</LI>
</uL>
<P>This function returns a <TT CLass="monofont">PyHANDLE</tT> object.
<TT Class="monofont">PyHANDLE</TT>s are simply objects that wrap standard
Win32 <TT clasS="monofont">HANDLE</TT>s. When a <Tt class="monofont">PyHANDLE</tt>
object goes out of scope, it's automatically closed; thus,
it's generally not necessary to close these
<tt class="monofont">HANDLE</tt>s as it is necessary when using these from C
or C++.</p>



<p>Let's see how these parameters interact and test out some of
the documented semantics. Here's a small script that uses the
<tt CLASS="monofont">win32file</Tt> module to work with Win32 file handles.
The code creates a file, then checks that other attempts to open the
file either succeed or fail, based on the flags passed to
<TT cLAsS="monofont">CreateFile()</TT>. You will also find that auto-delete
files behave as expected; i.e., after the last handle is closed, the
file no longer exists on disk:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont"># CheckFileSemantics.py
#    Demonstrate the semantics of CreateFile.

# To keep the source code small, 
# we import all win32file objects.
from win32file import *

import win32api
import os

# First, lets create a normal file
h1 = CreateFile( \
       "\\file1.tst", # The file name \

print "The first handle is", h1

# Now attempt to open the file again, 
# this time for read access
h2 = CreateFile( \
      "\\file1.tst", # The same file name. \

print "The second handle is", h2

# Now attempt yet again, but for write access.
# We expect this to fail.
try:
  h3 = CreateFile( \
        "\\file1.tst", # The same file name. \
        GENERIC_WRITE, # write access \
        0, # No special sharing \
        None, # No special security requirements \
        CREATE_ALWAYS, # attempting to recreate it! \
        0, # Not creating file, so no attributes  \
        None ) # No template file

except win32api.error, (code, function, message):
  print "The file could not be opened for write mode."
  print "Error", code, "with message", message

# Close the handles.
h1.Close()
h2.Close()

# Now lets check out the FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE
fileAttributes = FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL | \
                 FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE

h1 = CreateFile( \
       "\\file1.tst", # The file name \

       FILE_SHARE_READ, # others can open for read \
       None, # no special security requirements \
       CREATE_ALWAYS, # file to be created. \
       fileAttributes, \
       None ) # No template file.

# Do a stat of the file to ensure it exists.
print "File stats are", os.stat("\\file1.tst")

# Close the handle
h1.Close()

try:
    os.stat("\\file1.tst")
except os.error:
    print "Could not stat the file - file does not exist"</PRe>


<p>When you run this script, you see the following output:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">The first handle is &lt;PyHANDLE at 8344464 (80)&gt;
The second handle is &lt;PyHANDLE at 8344400 (112)&gt;
The file could not be opened for write mode.
Error 32 with message The process cannot access the file because
it is being used by another process.
File stats are (33206, 0, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0, 916111892, 916111892, 916111892)
Could not stat the file - file does not exist</pRE>


<P>Thus, the semantics are what you'd expect:</P>



<ul>
<li><p>A file opened to allow reading can be opened this way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A file opened to disallow writing can't be opened this way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A file opened for automatic delete is indeed deleted when the handle
is
closed.<a namE="idx1697"></A>

<H4>17.2.2
Reading and Writing Files</H4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx1699"></a>
<a NAME="idx1700"></a>The
<tt cLASS="monofont">win32file</tt> module has functions for reading and
writing files. Not surprisingly,
<tt CLASs="monofont">win32file.ReadFile()</tt>
<a name="idx1701"></a> reads files, and
<tt class="monofont">win32file.WriteFile()</tt>
<a naME="idx1702"></A> writes files.</P>



<P><Tt CLaSS="monofont">win32file.ReadFile()</tT> takes the following
parameters:</P>



<UL>
<LI><p>The file handle to read from</p>
</li>
<LI><P>The size of the data to read (see the reference for further details)</P>
</li>
<li><P>Optionally, an <TT Class="monofont">OVERLAPPED</TT> or
<TT class="monofont">None</tt></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="monofont">win32file.ReadFile()</tT> returns two pieces of
information in a Python tuple: the error code for
<TT CLAsS="monofont">ReadFile</Tt> and the data itself. The error code is
either zero or the value <TT cLASS="monofont">winerror.ERROR_IO_PENDING</TT>
if overlapped I/O is being performed. All other error codes are
trapped and raises a Python exception.</p>



<p><tt CLASs="monofont">win32file.WriteFile()</tt> takes the following
parameters:</p>



<UL>
<LI><p>A file handle opened to allow reading</p>
</li>
<LI><P>The data to write</P>
</li>
<li><p>Optionally, an <tt class="monofont">OVERLAPPED</tt> or
<tt class="monofont">None</TT></P>
</LI>
</Ul>
<P><Tt CLaSS="monofont">win32file.WriteFile()</TT> returns the error code from
the operation. This is either zero or
<TT clasS="monofont">win32error.ERROR_IO_PENDING</TT> if overlapped I/O is
used. All other error codes are converted to a Python exception.</P>







<h4>17.2.3
Overlapped I/O</h4>


<p>Windows provides a number of techniques for high-performance file
I/O. The most common is <a NAME="idx1703"></a>overlapped I/O. Using overlapped I/O, the
<tt cLASS="monofont">win32file.ReadFile()</tt> and
<tt class="monofont">win32file.WriteFile()</tt> operations are asynchronous
and return before the actual I/O operation has completed. When the
I/O operation finally completes, a Windows event is signaled.</p>



<p>Overlapped I/O does have some requirements normal I/O operations
don't:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>The operating system doesn't automatically advance the file
pointer. When not using overlapped I/O, a <tt CLASS="monofont">ReadFile</Tt>
or <TT cLAsS="monofont">WriteFile</TT> operation automatically advances the
file pointer, so the next operation automatically reads the
subsequent data in the file. When using overlapped I/O, you must
manage the location in the file manually.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>The standard technique of returning a Python string object from
<tT CLAss="monofont">win32file.ReadFile()</tt> doesn't work. Because
the I/O operation has not completed when the call returns, a Python
string can't be used.</P>
</LI>
</Ul>
<p>As you can imagine, the code for performing overlapped I/O is more
complex than when performing synchronous I/O. <a href="pythonwin32_cnode137.html">Chapter 18</A>, contains some sample
code that uses basic overlapped I/O on a Windows-named<a name="idx1704"></a> <a name="idx1705"></a> pipe<a name="idx1706"></a>.</p>
