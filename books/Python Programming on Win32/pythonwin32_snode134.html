<h3>17.3
Pipes</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1707"></a>Pipes
are a concept available in most modern operating systems. Typically,
these are a block of shared memory set up much like a file.
Typically, one process writes information to a pipe, and another
process reads it. They are often used as a form of interprocess
communication or as a simple queue implementation. Windows has two
flavors of pipes: anonymous pipes and named pipes. Python supports
both via the <tt cLASS="monofont">win32pipe</tt> module.</p>




<h4>17.3.1
Anonymous Pipes</H4>


<P>
<A Name="idx1708"></a>
<a name="idx1709"></a>Anonymous
pipes are simple and lightweight pipes, designed to use between the
process that creates it and its child processes. Since they are
unnamed, the only way to use anonymous pipes is to communicate its
handle; there's no name for the pipe that processes use to
obtain access to the pipe. This typically makes anonymous pipes
unsuitable for interprocess communication between unrelated processes
(for example, between a client and a server process).</p>



<p>Anonymous pipes are simple to create and use. The function
<tt class="monofont">win32pipe.CreatePipe()</tt>
<A NAME="idx1710"></A> creates an anonymous pipe and returns
two handles: one for reading from the pipe, and one for writing to
the pipe. The <tT ClASs="monofont">win32pipe.Create-Pipe()</TT> function
takes the following parameters:</P>



<UL>
<Li><p>The security attributes for the pipe or <tt CLASs="monofont">None</tt> for
the default.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>The buffer size or zero for the default.</p>
</li>
</UL>
<P>It then returns a tuple of (<Tt class="monofont">readHandle</tt>,
<tt class="monofont">writeHandle</tt>).</p>



<p>A demonstration of anonymous pipes is quite simple. Let's
create an anonymous pipe (obtaining the two handles), then write some
data to the pipe, and read the same data back:</p>



<pRE CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32pipe
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Create the pipe
&gt;&gt;&gt; readHandle, writeHandle = win32pipe.CreatePipe(None, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32file # This module contains the ReadFile/WriteFile functions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Write a string to the pipe
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32file.WriteFile(writeHandle, "Hi from the pipe")
(0, 16)
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Now read data from it
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32file.ReadFile(readHandle, 16)
(0, 'Hi from the pipe')
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRe>






<H4>17.3.2
Named Pipes</H4>


<p>
<A NAME="idx1711"></A>
<a namE="idx1712"></A>Named pipes are
similar to anonymous pipes, except they have a unique name.
Typically, a server process creates a named pipe with a known name,
and other client processes connect to this pipe simply by specifying
the name. The key benefit of named pipes is that unrelated processes
can use them, even from over the network. All a process needs is the
name of the pipe, possibly the name of the host server, and
sufficient security to open it. This makes named pipes suitable for
simple communication between a server and many clients.</P>



<P>Named pipes can be created only by Windows NT. Windows 95/98 can
create a client connection to an existing named pipe, but can't
create a new named pipe.</p>



<p>Creating and using named pipes is a complex subject and beyond the
scope of this book. However, an example using named pipes can be
found in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode137.html">Chapter 18</A>. The
<tt clASS="monofont">win32pipe</Tt> module supports all pipe operations
supported by Windows. For further information on named pipes, please
see the Windows SDK documentation or one of the pipe samples that
comes with the Python for Windows Extensions.<a name="idx1713"></a></p>
