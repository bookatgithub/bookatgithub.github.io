<h3>17.4
Processes</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1714"></a>Every
program running under Windows runs in the context of a process. A
process is an executing application and has a single virtual address
space, a list of valid handles, and other Windows resources. A
process consists of at least one thread, but may contain a large
number of threads.</p>



<p>Python has the ability to manage processes from a fairly high level,
right down to the low level defined by the Win32 API. This section
discusses some of these capabilities.</p>




<H4>17.4.1
Portable Process Control: The os Module</H4>


<P><Tt claSS="monofont"></TT>
<a name="idx1715"></a>Python itself defines a few
process-manipulation functions that are portable across all
platforms, including Windows. As they are portable to Unix and other
operating systems, they operate at a high level and don't cover
the range of functionality provided natively. The Python
<tt class="monofont">os</tt> module provides a number of techniques for
starting new processes.</p>




<h5>17.4.1.1
os.system</h5>


<p><tt CLASS="monofont">os.system</Tt>
<A NaME="idx1716"></a> provides the most rudimentary support
for new processes. It takes a single argument (the command line of
the process to execute) and returns an integer "error
code." For example:</P>



<PRE CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.system("notepad.exe C:\\autoexec.bat")
0
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pRE>


<P>starts an instance of <I>notepad</i>, editing your
<i>autoexec.bat</i> file. The exit code from the
program is zero. Unfortunately, the result of zero is often
misleading; the Windows command processor responsible for executing
these commands usually refuses to pass the actual error code on,
always reporting a success code of zero.</p>



<P>The single parameter can be anything that typically works from a
Windows command prompt. Thus, the system <TT Class="monofont">path</TT> is
searched for the program.</P>



<P>There are, however, a number of other limitations to this approach.
First, if you execute this code from PythonWin (or any other GUI
Python environment) you will notice that an empty command prompt
opens. Windows knows you are running from a GUI, but isn't
smart enough to look at the program to execute to determine if it too
is a GUI program; so it creates a new console for the program. This
works well when executing command-line tools, but not so well for GUI
programs such as <i>notepad</i>.</p>



<p>Second, notice that Python waits until the new process has terminated
before returning. Depending on your requirements, this may or may not
be appropriate.</p>






<h5>17.4.1.2
os.execv</h5>


<p><tt class="monofont">os.execv</tt>
<a namE="idx1717"></A> provides an interesting (although
often useless) way to create new processes. The program you specify
effectively replaces the calling process. Technically, the process to
be created is a new process (i.e., it has a different process ID), so
the new process doesn't replace the old process; the old
process simply terminates immediately after the call to
<TT CLaSS="monofont">os.execv</tT>. In effect, the new process executed
appears to overwrite the current process, almost as if the old
process becomes the new process; therefore, it's rarely used.</P>



<p><TT CLASs="monofont">os.execv</tt> takes two arguments: a string containing
the program to execute, and a tuple containing the program arguments.
For example, if you execute the following code:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.execv("c:\\Winnt\\notepad.exe", ("c:\\autoexec.bat",) )</PRE>


<P>Notice that your existing Python or PythonWin implementation
immediately terminates (no chance to save anything!) and is replaced
by an instance of <i>notepad</i>.</p>



<p>Also notice that <TT CLass="monofont">os.execv</tt> doesn't search
your system path. Therefore, you need to specify the full path to
<i>notepad</i>. You will probably need to change the
example to reflect your Windows installation.</p>



<p>Another function, <tt class="monofont">os.execve</tt>, is similar but allows
a custom environment for the new process to be defined.</p>






<h5>17.4.1.3
os.popen</h5>


<P><TT CLAsS="monofont">os.popen</Tt>
<A NaME="idx1718"></A> is also supposed to be a portable
technique for creating new processes and capturing their output.
<TT Class="monofont">os.popen</TT> takes three parameters: the command to
execute, the default mode for the pipe, and the buffer size. Only the
first parameter is required; the others have reasonable defaults (see
the Python Library Reference for details). The following code shows
that the function returns a Python file object, which can be read to
receive the data:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; file = os.popen("echo Hello from Python")
&gt;&gt;&gt; file.read()
'Hello from Python\012'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</Pre>


<p>If you try this code from <i>Python.exe</I>, you will
notice it works as expected. However, if you attempt to execute this
code from a GUI environment, such as PythonWin, you receive this
error:</P>



<PRe class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; os.popen("echo Hello from Python")
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;interactive input&gt;", line 0, in ?
error: (0, 'No error')
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Unfortunately, a bug in the Windows<a name="idx1719"></a> <tt claSS="monofont">popen</TT>
function prevents this working from a GUI environment.</P>



<P>Attempting to come to the rescue is the <tT ClASs="monofont">win32pipe</TT>
module, which provides a replacement <TT CLass="monofont">popen</tT> that
works in a GUI environment under Windows NT; see the following code:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32pipe
&gt;&gt;&gt; file=win32pipe.popen("echo Hello from Python")
&gt;&gt;&gt; file.read()
'Hello from Python\012'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRe>







<h4>17.4.2
Better Process Control: The win32api Module</h4>


<p><TT CLass="monofont"></tt>
<a name="idx1720"></a>The module <tt class="monofont">win32api</tt>
provides some additional techniques for manipulating processes. These
allow you to perform many of the common requirements for starting new
processes, but still don't provide the ultimate in low-level
control.</p>




<H5>17.4.2.1
win32api.WinExec</H5>


<P>The <TT ClASs="monofont">WinExec</TT>
<a NAME="idx1721"></A> function behaves similarly to the
<Tt claSS="monofont">os.system</TT> function, as described previously, but
it provides some concessions for GUI programs; namely, no console is
created, and the function doesn't wait until the new process
has completed. The function takes two parameters:</p>



<ul>
<lI><P>The command to execute</P>
</Li>
<li><p>Optionally, the initial state for the application's window</P>
</LI>
</Ul>
<p>For example, to execute <i>notepad</i>, using the
default window state, you can execute the following code:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32api
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32api.WinExec("notepad")
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p><i>notepad</i> should appear in a normal window, and
Python continues executing commands before you close
<i>notepad</i>.</P>



<P>To show <I>notepad</I> maximized:</P>



<PrE ClASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32api, win32con
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32api.WinExec("notepad", win32con.SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED)
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>





<H5>17.4.2.2
win32api.ShellExecute</H5>


<P>The <tt clASS="monofont">win32api</Tt> module also provides another useful
function for creating new processes. The
<tt cLASS="monofont">ShellExecute</tt>
<a nAME="idx1722"></A> function is primarily used to open
documents, rather than start arbitrary processes. For example, you
can tell <tt class="monofont">ShellExecute</tt> to "open
<i>MyDocument.doc</i>." Windows itself determines
which process to use to open <i>.doc</i> files and
start it on your behalf. This is the same function Windows Explorer
uses when you click (or double-click) on a <i>.doc</i>
file: it calls <tt clasS="monofont">ShellExecute</TT>, and the correct
program is started. The <TT ClASs="monofont">ShellExecute</TT> function
takes these parameters:</p>



<UL>
<LI><P>The handle to the parent window or zero for no parent.</P>
</li>
<li><P>The operation to perform on the file.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>The name of the file or program to execute.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>Optional parameters for the new process.</p>
</li>
<LI><P>The initial directory for the application.</P>
</li>
<li><p>A flag indicating if the application should be shown.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's try this function. Start Python or PythonWin from a
directory with a <i>.doc</i> file in it, then execute
the following commands:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32api
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32api.ShellExecute(0, "open", \
...    "MyDocument.doc", None, "", 1)
33
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<P>Assuming Microsoft Word is installed, this code opens the document
<I>MyDocument.doc</i>. If you instead wish to print
this document, execute this:</P>



<PrE ClASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32api
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32api.ShellExecute(0, "print", \
...    "MyDocument.doc", None, "", 1)
33
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<p>Microsoft Word then opens and prints the
document.<tt cLASS="monofont"></tt>
<a nAME="idx1723"></A></p>








<h4>17.4.3
Ultimate Process Control: The win32process Module</h4>


<p>The <TT CLass="monofont">win32process</tt>
<a name="idx1724"></a> module provides the ultimate in process
level control; it exposes most of the native Windows API for
starting, stopping, controlling, and waiting for processes. But
before we delve into the <tt class="monofont">win32process</tt> module, some
definitions are in order.</p>




<H5>17.4.3.1
Handles and IDs</H5>


<P>Every thread and process in the system can be identified by a Windows
<A NAmE="idx1725"></A>handle, and by an
integer <a NAmE="idx1726"></A>ID. A process or
thread ID is a unique number allocated for the process or thread and
is valid across the entire system. An ID is invariant while the
thread or process is running and serves no purpose other than to
uniquely identify the thread or process. IDs are reused, so while two
threads or processes will never share the same ID while running, the
same ID may be reused by the system once it has terminated. Further,
IDs are not secure. Any user can obtain the ID for a thread or
process. This is not a security problem, as the ID is not sufficient
to control the thread or process.</P>



<P>A handle provides additional control capabilities for the thread or
handle. Using a handle, you can wait for a process to terminate,
force the termination of a process, or change the characteristics of
a running process.</P>



<P>While a process can have only a single ID, there may be many handles
to it. The handle to a process determines the rights a user has to
perform operations on the process or thread.</p>



<p>Given a process ID, the function
<tt CLASs="monofont">win32api.OpenProcess()</tt> can obtain a handle. The
ability to use this handle is determined by the security settings for
both the current user and the process itself.</p>






<H5>17.4.3.2
Creating processes</H5>


<P>
<A name="idx1727"></A>The
<TT Class="monofont">win32process</tt> module contains two functions for
creating new processes:
<tt class="monofont">CreateProcess()</tt>
<a name="idx1728"></a> and
<TT CLASs="monofont">CreateProcessAsUser()</TT>
<a NAmE="idx1729"></A>. These functions are identical, except
<TT CLass="monofont">CreateProcessAsUser()</tT> accepts an additional
parameter indicating the user under which the process should be
created.</P>



<P><Tt claSS="monofont">CreateProcess()</TT> accepts a large number of
arguments that allow very fine control over the new process:</p>



<ul>
<lI><P>The program to execute</P>
</Li>
<li><p>Optional command-line parameters</p>
</li>
<li><p>Security attributes for the new process or <tt class="monofont">None</tt></p>
</lI>
<LI><P>Security attributes for the main thread of the new process or
<TT cLAsS="monofont">None</Tt></P>
</LI>
<LI><P>A flag indicating if handles are inherited by the new process</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Flags indicating how the new process is to be created</P>
</Li>
<li><p>A new environment for the new process or <TT CLass="monofont">None</tT> for
the current environment</P>
</LI>
<li><p>The current directory for the new process</p>
</li>
<li><p>Information indicating how the new window is to be positioned and
shown</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And returns a tuple with four elements:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>A handle to the new process</P>
</LI>
<LI><P>A handle to the main thread of the new process</p>
</LI>
<lI><P>An integer identifying the new process</p>
</LI>
<LI><P>An integer identifying the main thread of the new process</P>
</li>
</ul>





<H5>17.4.3.3
Terminating processes</H5>


<P>
<A name="idx1730"></A>To
terminate a process, the
<TT Class="monofont">win32process.TerminateProcess()</TT> function is used.
This function takes two parameters:</P>



<Ul>
<li><p>A handle to the process to be terminated</p>
</li>
<li><p>The exit code to associate with the process</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you initially created the new process, it's quite easy to
get the handle to the process; you simply remember the result of the
<tt claSS="monofont">win32process.CreateProcess()</TT> call.</P>



<P>But what happens if you didn't create the process? If you know
the process ID, you can use the function
<tT ClASs="monofont">win32api.OpenProcess()</TT>
<A NAMe="idx1731"></a> to obtain a handle. But how do you
find the process ID? There's no easy answer to that question.
The file <tt CLASs="monofont">killProcName.py</tt> that comes with the
Python for Windows Extensions shows one method of obtaining the
process ID given the process name. It also shows how to use the
<tT CLAss="monofont">win32api.OpenProcess()</tt> function to obtain a
process handle suitable to terminate.</P>






<H5>17.4.3.4
Controlling processes</H5>


<P>
<a name="idx1732"></a>Once
a process is running, there are two process
<a name="idx1733"></a>properties that can be set: the
<i>priority</i>
<a name="idx1734"></a> and the <i>affinity
mask</I>
<A NAME="idx1735"></a>. The priority of the process
determines how the operating system schedules the threads in the
process. The <TT cLAsS="monofont">win32process.SetPriorityClass()</TT>
function can set the priority.</P>



<P>A process's affinity mask defines which processor the process
runs on, which obviously makes this useful only in a multiprocessor
system. The <Tt claSS="monofont">win32process.SetProcessAffinityMask()</TT>
function allows you to define this behavior.</p>






<h5>17.4.3.5
Putting it all together</h5>


<p>This section presents a simple example that demonstrates how to use
the <TT CLass="monofont">CreateProcess</tT>
<A NAme="idx1736"></a>
<a name="idx1737"></a>
API and process handles. In the interests of allowing the salient
points to come through, this example won't really do anything
too useful; instead, it's restricted to the following
functionality:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>Creates two instances of <i>notepad</i> with its window
position carefully laid out.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Waits 10 seconds for these instances to terminate.</P>
</LI>
<Li><P>If the instances haven't terminated in that time, kills them.</P>
</lI>
</Ul>
<P>This functionality demonstrates the
<TT CLAss="monofont">win32process.CreateProcess()</tt> function, how to use
<TT CLass="monofont">win32process.STARTUPINFO()</tT> objects, and how to
wait on process handles using the
<TT Class="monofont">win32event.WaitForMultipleObjects()</TT> function.</P>



<P>Note that instead of waiting 10 seconds in one block, you actually
wait for one second 10 times. This is so you can print a message out
once per second, so it's obvious the program is working
correctly:</p>



<pre class="monofont"># CreateProcess.py
#
# Demo of creating two processes using the CreateProcess API,
# then waiting for the processes to terminate.
