<h3>18.4
Windows NT Performance Monitor Data</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1793"></a>The Windows NT <a naME="idx1794"></A>Performance Monitor is a tool and API that
allows applications to provide performance data in a consistent way.
Administrators can use the Performance Monitor tool to view this data
graphically, or programs can themselves use this data for more
advanced purposes, such as taking daily samples of performance data
and logging to a database.</P>



<p>Using the Performance Monitor has a number of benefits for both the
administrator and programmer. The administrator can use a single,
consistent interface for monitoring performance, regardless of the
application in question; indeed, the administrator can simultaneously
view performance information from two unrelated applications to
assist in diagnosing performance bottlenecks. For you, the
programmer, the biggest advantage is that you can provide detailed
performance information for your application, but don't need to
deliver any tools for viewing or analyzing this data; Windows NT and
third-party tools provide all the functionality anyone could need!</p>



<p>In the next section we discuss the concepts behind the Performance
Monitor, and how you can read Performance Monitor data using Python.
Later in this chapter we will present how Python can provide
Performance Monitor data for our sample Windows NT Service.</p>




<H4>18.4.1
Anatomy of the Performance Monitor</H4>


<P>To use the Performance Monitor, an application must register one or
more <A name="idx1795"></a>Performance
Monitor <i>objects</i>. An object is a logical grouping
of Performance Monitor data; it is quite common for an application to
have a single object, grouping all performance-related data from the
application in this single object.</p>



<p>For each object, the application must register one or more
<i>counters</i>
<a name="idx1796"></a>
<a namE="idx1797"></A>. A
counter provides a single piece of performance data. Attributes about
a counter include the units and the default scale for the final
value. The units indicate how the counter values are to be
transformed (for example, turned into a rate per second), while the
scale defines a multiplication factor applied before the value is
displayed or graphed.</P>



<P>For example, let's assume the application needs to keep a
counter for connections per second made to it. The application is
fast, so expect a hit rate in the thousands of connections per
second. You would define your counter as having units of "per
second" and a scale of "divide by 100." All the
application needs to do is increment the counter once for each
connection established, and the Performance Monitor itself will
handle the transformation of the raw counter data to a value in the
range 1 to 100 that represents the connections per second. The
Performance Monitor has kept track of how many counter increments
were made in the last second and applied the appropriate conversions.</P>



<P>As you can see, from the application's point of view it's
quite simple and unobtrusive; once the counters are defined, simply
increment a counter whenever you do something interesting. The
Performance Monitor manages the translation to useful units. For the
program that wishes to view Performance Monitor information,
it's also simple: the Performance Monitor itself has already
translated the raw values into user-friendly values ready to display.
Unfortunately, as we shall see later, the installation and definition
of these counters isn't particularly easy, but once that is
mastered, the actual usage of the counters in your application is
simple.</p>



<P>In addition to objects and counters, the final Performance Monitor
concept we mention is that of an
<I>instance</i>
<A NaME="idx1798"></A>
<A NAme="idx1799"></a>. A
counter can optionally have any number of instances associated with
it. An instance is used where a single counter applies to multiple
things. The most basic example is the Performance Monitor data for
the CPU in your computer. Windows NT defines the object and a few
counters for data related to a CPU. However, as there may be multiple
CPUs installed in a PC, each counter can have an instance, one for
each CPU. Thus, when you need to collect performance data for a
specific CPU, you need to know the instance you are interested in, or
you can ask to collect data for all instances. Most counters provided
by applications don't have instances associated with them. In
our previous example where we kept total client connections, no
instance would be associated with the counter. In all the Performance
Monitor examples that follow, we don't use counters with
instances, but the concept is mentioned for completeness.</p>



<P>To see these concepts, the simplest thing is to start the Windows NT
Performance Monitor (from the Administrative Tools group under the
Windows NT Start menu), and select Edit <IMG bordER="0" ALign="absmiddle" wIDTH="20" height="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Add to chart. In the
dialog that's presented, you can clearly see the list of
objects, counters, and instances. As you select different objects,
the available counters will change. Depending on the counter you
select, instances may or may not be available. Python can also
display this list, so we will move on to Python and the Performance
Monitor.</p>







<h4>18.4.2
Reading the Performance Monitor from Python</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1800"></A>Python exposes the ability to read
Performance Monitor information from the <TT CLAsS="monofont">win32pdh</Tt>
and <TT cLASS="monofont">win32pdhutil</TT> modules. These modules use a
Microsoft API to access the Performance Monitor known as the
Performance Data Helper, or PDH, hence the name of the Python
modules.</p>




<h5>18.4.2.1
Browsing for counters</h5>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx1801"></a>To get a feel for these Python modules,
let's start with a demonstration of displaying a dialog for the
user to browse and select the counters on this or any machine.</p>



<p>The <TT CLass="monofont">win32pdhutil</tT>
<A NAme="idx1802"></a> module provides a function
<tt class="monofont">browse()</tt> that displays such a dialog. As the user
selects the Add button in the dialog, a function you provide is
called with the selected counter. This callback function is supplied
as a parameter to
<tt class="monofont">win32pdhutil.browse()</tt>
<A NAME="idx1803"></A>. The first step is to provide the
callback function, which takes a single parameter—the name of
the counter. Our example simply prints this name.</p>



<P>Thus, the callback function can be defined as follows:</P>



<pRE cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; def CounterCallback( counter ):
...     print "Counter is", counter
...     
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRe>


<p>You can display the dialog by importing the
<tt CLASs="monofont">win32pdhutil</tt> module and calling the
<tT CLAss="monofont">browse()</tt> function passing the callback:</P>



<PRE class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32pdhutil
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32pdhutil.browse(CounterCallback)</pre>


<p>A dialog is presented that allows you to select all the counters
available on the system and even other systems! Select the Add button
and your function is called, printing the selected counter. <a href="pythonwin32_snode142.html#5">Figure 18.1</a> shows the code running under Python-Win, just
after selecting the Add button.</p>

<iMG bORDER="0" Width="502" HEIGht="396" src="FILES/ppw.1801.gif" ALT="figs/ppw.1801.gif"></centER>


<P>The counter definition is a simple string, with the machine, object,
counter, and instance portions all embedded in the string. The
<Tt class="monofont">win32pdh</tt> module contains functions for parsing a
string of this format into the constituent parts and for building
such a string from the parts; see the <tt class="monofont">win32pdhutil</tt>
module source code for more details.</p>



<p>Once you've determined the counters you want, obtaining the
information is quite simple: use the
<tt CLASS="monofont">win32pdhutil.GetPerformanceAttributes()</Tt>
<A NaME="idx1804"></a> function. In the simple case of a
counter on the local machine without instances, you need pass only
the object name and the counter name. For example, an object called
Memory provides a number of counters, including one called Available
Bytes. To obtain the value, use the code:</P>



<PRE CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; win32pdhutil.GetPerformanceAttributes("Memory", "Available Bytes")
18358272
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pRE>


<P>This demonstrates an interesting use of the Performance Monitor.
There is some information about the system that's not easily
available from the Windows API, but is available from the Performance
Monitor. Statistics about processes (including its process ID) or
about the memory in the system can often be obtained in far more
detail by using the Performance Monitor than by using the
API.<A name="idx1805"></A></P>
