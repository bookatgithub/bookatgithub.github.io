<h3>18.5
Writing Services in Python</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1806"></a>We
have already discussed how Python can control services, now
let's see how to write services in Python. Services written in
Python are first-class services and provide all the functionality of
services written in C.</p>




<h4>18.5.1
The Anatomy of a Service</h4>


<P>Before we launch into how to write a service in Python, we must
discuss some important service concepts. This will help you
understand some of the design and implementation decisions made for
Python services.</P>



<P>Windows NT starts a service by executing a process. Once this process
starts, it's expected to report to the SCM that it's
indeed a service and that it's starting. It also must pass to
the SCM a control handler; that is, a function that responds to
control messages sent by the SCM. The service process then executes.
When the service is to be stopped, the SCM notifies the control
handler of the stop request. The service itself is responsible for
handling this request and terminating itself.</P>



<p>This leads to most services, regardless of the language they are
written in, being structured as follows: A main thread starts. This
thread initializes itself by reporting to the SCM and passing it the
control handler. Once initialization is complete, the thread starts a
worker loop waiting either for work to do or a notification to stop,
pause, etc. The SCM calls the control handler on another thread, so
once the function receives the control notification, it reports back
to the SCM it's stopping, then triggers some synchronization
object that the main thread will notice next time around the loop. As
the main thread terminates, it continues to report its status to the
SCM.</p>







<h4>18.5.2
The Anatomy of a Python Service</h4>


<P>The same executable hosts most Python services,
<I>PythonService.exe</I>
<A name="idx1807"></a>. This special executable is aware of the
special requirements for services that make
<i>Python.exe</i> unsuitable for the task.</p>



<p>When <i>PythonService.exe</i> is asked to start a
service, it looks in the registry for the Python class that
implements the service. It then creates an instance of this class,
and delegates all service functionality to this instance. For
example, when the service is to start, a method named
<tt class="monofont">SvcStart</tt> is called on the object. When the SCM
makes a control request, a method named
<tT CLASS="monofont">ServiceControlHandler</tT> is called. These Python
methods are expected to correctly report their status to the SCM, by
calling helper functions provided by
<I>PythonService.exe</i>.</P>



<P>To make life as simple as possible for the Python programmer, a base
class <tT CLASS="monofont">ServiceFramework</tt> is provided in the module
<tt CLASs="monofont">win32serviceutil</tt>
<a NAME="idx1808"></a>. The easiest way to write a service in
Python is to subclass this class, then concentrate on the service
functionality rather than on the interactions with the SCM.</p>







<h4>18.5.3
The win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework Class</h4>


<P>As described previously, most Python services will be a subclass of
the
<TT Class="monofont">win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework</tt>
<a name="idx1809"></a> class. This has a number of default
methods and helper methods to make writing services in Python easier:</p>



<a name="idx1810"></a><a nAME="idx1811"></A><A NaME="idx1812"></a><DL>
<dT>
<FONT Color="#990000"><FONT coloR="#990000"><SPAn claSS="monofont">__init__</SPan></font>

<a name="idx1810"></a></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>The constructor for the class. This registers the method
<TT CLASs="monofont">ServiceCtrlHandler</TT> as the handler for notification
messages from the SCM.</p>
</DD>
<dT>
<FONT Color="#990000"><FONT coloR="#990000"><SPAn claSS="monofont">ServiceCtrlHandler</SPan></font>

<a name="idx1811"></a></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides a default implementation of the service control handler.
This method interrogates the class for certain named methods to
determine which controls the service responds to. For example, if the
service contains a <TT CLASs="monofont">SvcPause</TT> method, it's
assumed the service can be paused.</p>
</DD>
<dT>
<FONT Color="#990000"><FONT coloR="#990000"><SPAn claSS="monofont">SvcRun</SPan></font>

<a name="idx1812"></a></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>A default implementation of the entry point for the service. This
method notifies the SCM that the service has started, calls a method
<TT CLASs="monofont">SvcDoRun</TT>, then when complete notifies the SCM the
service is stopping (<i>PythonService.exe</I>
automatically notifies the SCM that the service has stopped). Thus,
you need only provide a <Tt CLASS="monofont">SvcDoRun</Tt> method in the
subclass that handles the functionality of your service.</p>
</dd>
</DL>






<H4>18.5.4
The Smallest Possible Python Service</H4>


<p>
<a naME="idx1813"></A>Before we move on to a more
substantial service written in Python, let's write the smallest
possible service in Python. This service will do no actual work other
than interact with the SCM.</P>



<p>The key points from this example code are:</p>



<ul>
<LI><P>The logic for stopping the service must be provided by your
application. This sample service uses a Win32 event object and when
the command to stop the service is received, it sets this event. The
service itself does nothing other than wait for this event to be set.</P>
</li>
<li><p>The name of the service and the display name of the service must be
provided by the subclass.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This code contains startup code that handles the command line when
run as a script. This provides facilities for installing, debugging,
and starting the service, as described in the next section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre clASS="monofont"># SmallestService.py

import win32serviceutil

        win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework.__init__(self, args)
        # Create an event which we will use to wait on.
        # The "service stop" request will set this event.
        self.hWaitStop = win32event.CreateEvent(None, 0, 0, None)

    def SvcStop(self):
        # Before we do anything, tell the SCM we are starting the stop process.
        self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
        # And set my event.
        win32event.SetEvent(self.hWaitStop)

<h4>18.5.5
Installing, Debugging, and Running a Python Service</H4>


<P>
<a NAmE="idx1814"></A>Now
that we have a service written in Python, what to do with it? This
section discusses installing the service, debugging the service, and
starting and stopping the service.</P>




<H5>18.5.5.1
Installing the service</H5>


<P>As discussed previously, an application named
<i>PythonService.exe</i> hosts all Python services.
This executable must be registered before you can install the
service. The registration process need only be run once per machine,
regardless of how many services the program hosts. The installation
package for the Python for Windows extensions automatically registers
this, but the information is included here for completeness. To
register <i>PythonService.exe</i>, perform the
following steps:</P>



<OL Type="1">
<lI><P>Start a command prompt.</P>
</Li>
<li><p>Change to the directory containing
<I>PythonService.exe</I>, typically <I>\Program
Files \Python\win32.</I></p>
</li>
<li><p>Execute the command:</p>

<pre class="monofont">C:\Program Files\Python\win32&gt;PythonService.exe /register
Registering the Python Service Manager...
C:\Program Files\Python\win32&gt;</pre>
</li>
</oL>



<P>Now to install the service, perform the following steps:</P>



<OL TyPE="1">
<lI><P>Start a command prompt.</p>
</LI>
<LI><P>Change to the directory containing the Python source code that
implements the service.</P>
</li>
<li><P>Execute the command:</P>

<PRe claSS="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; SmallestService.py install
Installing service SmallestPythonService to Python class 
   C:\Scripts\SmallestService.SmallestPythonService
Service installed
C:\Scripts&gt;</PRe>
</li>
</oL>



<P>The service is now installed and ready to run. To confirm the service
has been correctly installed, use the control panel to start the
Services applet and scroll down until you find the "The
smallest possible Python Service."</P>






<H5>18.5.5.2
Starting and stopping the service</h5>


<p>
<a name="idx1815"></a>There
are a number of ways to start or stop a service. Our Python script
can start and stop itself. To do this, use the following command:</p>



<pre class="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; python.exe SmallestService.py start
Starting service SmallestPythonService
C:\Scripts&gt;</pre>


<p>The service is now running. To confirm this, let's try
executing the same command again:</P>



<PRE CLaSS="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; python.exe SmallestService.py start
Starting service SmallestPythonService
Error starting service: An instance of the service is already running.
C:\Scripts&gt;</pRE>


<p>As you can see, only one instance of a service can be running at any
time. To stop the service, use the following command:</P>



<PRE CLass="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; python.exe SmallestService.py stop
Stopping service SmallestPythonService
C:\Scripts&gt;</pRE>


<P>There are two other common techniques for starting and stopping
services:</P>



<ul>
<li><P>Using the Services applet in the control panel, which provides a GUI
for starting, stopping, or pausing services.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>Using the <i>net.exe</I> program supplied with Windows
NT. From a Windows NT command prompt, this command starts the
service:</P>

<PRe class="monofont">C:\Anywhere&gt; net start SmallestPythonService</pre>


<p>This command stops the service:</p>



<pre class="monofont">C:\Anywhere&gt; net stop SmallestPythonService</prE>
</LI>
</UL>
