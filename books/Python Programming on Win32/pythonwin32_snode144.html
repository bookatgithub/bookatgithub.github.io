<h3>18.6
Sample Service Written in Python</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1817"></a>Before we move to some of the advanced
topics, we will develop the basis for a real Python service that
actually does something useful!</p>



<p>The first version of our service starts by accepting connections over
a <a NAME="idx1818"></a>named pipe and
comes complete with a client that connects to the service. You then
enhance the service by writing to the Event Log and by providing
Performance Monitor data.</p>



<p>The first cut looks very much like the
<tT CLAss="monofont">SmallestPythonService</tt>, except it has more meat in
the <tt class="monofont">SvcDoRun()</tt>
<a name="idx1819"></a> method. The main thread creates a named
pipe and waits for either a client to connect or a service control
request.</p>



<p>More information on named pipes can be found in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode130.html">Chapter 17</A>.This example also shows a number of concepts
important when using named pipes. It shows how to use overlapped I/O,
and how to create a special security object useful for named-pipe
services:</p>

# named-pipe to accept client connections.

    def __init__(self, args):

        self.hWaitStop = win32event.CreateEvent(None, 0, 0, None)
        # We need to use overlapped IO for this, so we don't block when
        # waiting for a client to connect.  This is the only effective way
        # to handle either a client connection, or a service stop request.
        self.overlapped = pywintypes.OVERLAPPED()
        # And create an event to be used in the OVERLAPPED object.
        self.overlapped.hEvent = win32event.CreateEvent(None,0,0,None)

        # Before we do anything, tell the SCM we are starting the stop process.
        self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
        # And set my event.

    def SvcDoRun(self):

                hr = win32pipe.ConnectNamedPipe(pipeHandle, self.overlapped)

                win32event.SetEvent(self.overlapped.hEvent)

                try:
                    hr, data = win32file.ReadFile(pipeHandle, 256)
                    win32file.WriteFile(pipeHandle, "You sent me:" + data)
                    # And disconnect from the client.
                    win32pipe.DisconnectNamedPipe(pipeHandle)
                except win32file.error:
                    # Client disconnected without sending data
                    # or before reading the response.
                    # Thats OK - just get the next connection
                    continue
                    
if __name__=='__main__':
    win32serviceutil.HandleCommandLine(PipeService)</PRE>


<P>This technique for working with named pipes doesn't scale well;
our version accepts only a single client connection at a time.
Another alternative is to use a new thread to process each connection
as it comes in, as demonstrated in
<i>pipeTestService.py,</i> which comes with the
Window's extensions. Even this solution doesn't scale
when the number of connections starts to become large, and other
techniques, such as thread pooling or NT Completion Ports should be
used.</p>



<p>Now let's write a client program to use this service. The
client program is quite simple, because the Win32 API function
<TT CLass="monofont">CallNamedPipe()</tT> encapsulates all of the code most
clients ever need. <TT Class="monofont">CallNamedPipe()</TT> is available in
the <TT class="monofont">win32pipe</tt> module.</p>



<p>The client sends all the command-line parameters to the server, then
prints the server's response:</p>



<pre class="monofont"># PipeServiceClient.py
#
# A client for testing the PipeService.
#
# Usage:
#
#   PipeServiceClient.py message

import win32pipe
import sys
import string

if __name__=='__main__':
    message = string.join(sys.argv[1:])
    pipeName = "\\\\.\\pipe\\PyPipeService"
    data = win32pipe.CallNamedPipe(pipeName, message, 512, 0)
    print "The service sent back:"
    print data</pre>


<P>Now let's test the service. The first step is to register the
service:</P>



<PRE ClASs="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; PipeService1 install
Installing service PythonPipeService to Python class 
   C:\Scripts\PipeService1.PipeService
Service installed
C:\Scripts&gt;</PRe>


<P>Now start the service:</P>



<PRE Class="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; PipeService1.py start
Starting service PythonPipeService
C:\Scripts&gt;</PRE>


<P>And use the client to send the service some data:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; PipeServiceClient.py Hi there, how are you
The service sent back:
You sent me:Hi there, how are you
C:&gt;Scripts&gt;</pre>


<P>Our service seems to be working as expected!</P>



<P>You're now finished; you can stop the service:</P>



<pre class="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; PipeService1.py stop
Stopping service PythonPipeService
C:&gt;Scripts&gt;</pre>


<p>And remove it from the Service database:</p>



<pre class="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; PipeService1.py remove
Removing service PythonPipeService
Service removed
C:\Scripts&gt;</PRE>
