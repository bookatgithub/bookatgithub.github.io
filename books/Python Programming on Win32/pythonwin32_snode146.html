<h3>18.8
Providing Performance Monitor Information</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1839"></a>The
next step in our service will be to generate performance information
that can be used by the Windows NT Performance Monitor.</p>



<p>The Performance Monitor itself is a fairly complex beast with many
options. We will attempt to cover only the basics, enough to install
a couple of counters into our sample service. If you require more
advanced techniques, you should see the Win32 SDK documentation on
the Performance Monitor.</p>



<P>The Performance Monitor has been designed to have minimal impact on
the applications providing data. Applications provide raw data (by
way of <A NAme="idx1840"></a>counters),
and the responsibility of formatting and translating that data falls
to the application processing the data (e.g., the Performance Monitor
application provided with Windows NT). When a counter is added to the
Performance Monitor, it indicates the type of data it represents. For
example, one counter may indicate a raw count, such as total
connections made, or it may be a value that should be interpreted
over time, such as bytes sent per second. In both cases, the
application increments a counter, and the Performance Monitor itself
determines how far the counter was incremented in the last second and
calculates the actual value to be displayed.</p>



<P>Counters are grouped together to form a Performance Monitor object.
These objects exist purely to group related counters together. When
you use the NT Performance Monitor Application, you must first select
the object you wish to obtain data on, then the counters for that
object. Windows NT comes with a number of objects and counters that
obtain the performance of the operating system itself. For example,
there is a standard processor object, and this object has counters
such as percent of processor time, percent of interrupt time, and so
forth.</P>



<P>The Performance Monitor expects to obtain the counter and object
information from a special DLL. This DLL has public entry-points
specific to Performance Monitor, and this DLL is loaded whenever the
Performance Monitor needs information on the specific object. In
general, this DLL is not an integral part of the application itself,
but is instead a custom DLL written expressly for the Performance
Monitor. Memory mapped files are typically used to share the counter
data between the application itself and the Performance Monitor DLL.</P>



<p>When the application is installed, it must provide the Performance
Monitor with definitions of the objects and counters it provides.
These definitions include a name for the counter, and a description
for the counter. The application must also provide the name of the
DLL that provides the data.</p>




<h4>18.8.1
Performance Monitor Data from Python</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1841"></a>The
Python Win32 Extensions include support for providing Performance
Monitor information. This support consists of the
<tt class="monofont">perfmon</tt>
<a NAME="idx1842"></A> module that your application uses to
define the counters and provide the counter data. A DLL named
<I>perfmondata.dll</i>
<A NaME="idx1843"></a>
is supplied as the Performance Monitor DLL; this is the DLL that the
Performance Monitor loads to acquire your performance data.</P>




<H5>18.8.1.1
Installing Performance Monitor information</H5>


<P>
<A Name="idx1844"></a>As
mentioned previously, it's necessary to register with the
Performance Monitor when your application is installed. To install
Performance Monitor information, you must provide the following
information:</P>



<UL>
<Li><p>The name of a C header (<i>.h</i>) file providing
information about the counters</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>The name of a Windows INI file providing the definitions of the
counters</p>
</lI>
<LI><P>The name of the DLL providing Performance Monitor information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is necessary only at installation time: the
<i>.h</i> and <i>.ini</i> files
aren't required at runtime. The Performance Monitor APIs are
very much C and C++ focussed, hence the requirement for the
<i>.h</i> file. Often, this <i>.h</i>
file would be included in the C/C++ project, but as we are using
Python, we need to author a <i>.h</i> file that's
used only for the installation process.</p>



<p>The header file contains
<tt cLASS="monofont">#define</TT>
<a NAmE="idx1845"></A> statements for
each counter. Each <tT CLASS="monofont">#define</tt> lists the offset of the
specific counter in two-byte multiples. The offset zero defines the
object itself.</p>



<p>For our sample, we provide two counters, connections per second and
the bytes received per second. Thus, the header file will have three
entries: the object at offset 0, the first counter at offset 2, and
the last counter at offset 4.</P>



<P>For the sample application, use the <I>.h</I> file in
the following code:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">// PipeService2_install.h
// File used at installation time to install
// Performance Monitor Counters for our sample service.
//
// All these list the counters in order.
// Important that you add these in this order in
// the Python code.

#define SERVICE 0
#define CONNECTIONS 2 // Number of connections
#define BYTES 4 // Number of bytes received.</pre>


<P>You also need a Windows INI file that defines the counters
themselves. This INI file has three required sections: the
<TT Class="monofont">[info]</tt> section defines the name of the
application, the <tt class="monofont">[languages]</tt> section defines the
list of languages in which you are providing descriptions, and the
<tt clasS="monofont">[text]</TT> section that describes the counters
themselves. The INI file for the sample service looks like the
following code:</P>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont">; PipeService2_install.ini
; File used at installation time to install
; Performance Monitor Counters for our sample service.
;
[info]
; drivername MUST be the same as the service name
drivername=PythonPipeService
symbolfile=PipeService2_install.h

[languages]
009=English

[text]
SERVICE_009_NAME=Python Demo Service
SERVICE_009_HELP=Shows performance statistics for the sample Python service
CONNECTIONS_009_NAME=Number of connections per second.
CONNECTIONS_009_HELP=Indicates the load on the service.
BYTES_009_NAME=Bytes read/sec
BYTES_009_HELP=Number of bytes read per second by the service.</pRE>


<P>Note that the text section provides the names and descriptions for
both the object itself (Python Demo Service) and the counters. Also
note that the <TT Class="monofont">drivername</TT> entry must be the same as
the service.</P>



<P>The final piece of the puzzle is the name of the DLL used to provide
the Performance Monitor data. As described previously, a generic DLL
is provided with the Win32 Extensions for this purpose. This file can
be found at <i>Python\Win32\perfmondata.dll</i>.</p>



<p>Now we have all the pieces, but how do we install the data? It
shouldn't be a surprise to hear that Python makes this much
easier for us. As Performance Monitor information is a common
requirement for services, the Python service installation procedure
supports additional parameters for this purpose.</P>



<P>When installing a Python service, the command-line options are
<TT clasS="monofont">--perfmonini</TT> (names the INI file) and optionally,
<Tt class="monofont">--perfmondll</tt> (names the DLL that provides the
data).</p>



<p>Let's reinstall our service. Because the service uses the
default DLL, you need to specify only the name of the
<i>.ini</i> file. Use the command:</p>



<pre class="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; python.exe PipeService2.py --perfmonini=PipeService2_install.ini install
Installing service PythonPipeService to Python class C:\Scripts\PipeService2.PipeService
Changing service configuration
Service updated</PRE>


<P>The last message is "service updated" rather than
"service installed." This is because the installation
procedure realizes the service is already installed and simply
updates the service configuration. When you remove the service later,
the Performance Monitor information is automatically uninstalled.</P>



<P>As mentioned previously, the <i>.h</I> and
<I>.ini</i> files are needed only for this one-time
installation process. If you wish, you can remove these files
now.<A NaME="idx1846"></A></P>






<H5>18.8.1.2
Defining the counters</H5>


<p>Now that you've successfully registered your service with the
Performance Monitor, you need to define the
<a naME="idx1847"></A>counters. Then you can
finally update the counters while the service is running.</P>



<p>The process for defining the counters is:</p>



<ol TYPE="1">
<li><p>Create each counter and set its attributes.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>Create the Performance Monitor object and add the counters to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a Performance Monitor manager, passing the objects.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>To do this, add the following two methods to your service class:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">def InitPerfMon(self):
        # Magic numbers (2 and 4) must match header and ini file used
        # at install - could lookup ini, but then Id need it a runtime
        
        # A counter for number of connections per second.
        self.counterConnections=perfmon.CounterDefinition(2) 
        # We arent expecting many, so we set the scale high (ie, x10)
        # Note the scale is 10^DefaultScale = ie, to get 10, we use 1!
        self.counterConnections.DefaultScale = 1

        # Now a counter for the number of bytes received per second.
        self.counterBytes=perfmon.CounterDefinition(4)
        self.counterBytes.DefaultScale = 0

        # Now register our counters with the performance monitor
        perfObjectType = perfmon.ObjectType( 
                          (self.counterConnections, self.counterBytes) )
        
        self.perfManager = perfmon.PerfMonManager(
                        self._svc_name_,
                        (perfObjectType,),
                        "perfmondata")
                        
    def TermPerfMon(self):
        self.perfManager.Close()
        self.perfManager = None</PRE>


<P>Note the magic numbers passed to the
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">perfmon.CounterDefinition()</tT> calls. These must be
the offsets as defined in the <I>.h</I> file used at
installation. The <TT Class="monofont">perfmon.PerfMonManager()</TT> call
also warrants some extra comments. The first parameter is the
<TT clasS="monofont">drivername</TT> as specified in the
<I>.ini</i> file. As mentioned previously, this must be
the name of the service. The last parameter is the name of the
memory-mapped file that communicates the data between the service and
the Performance Monitor DLL. This must be the base name of the DLL
providing Performance Monitor information. The standard DLL is named
<i>perfmondata.dll</i>, so you pass
<tT CLAss="monofont">perfmondata</tt>. If you chose to rename the DLL for
your own application, you must reflect the new name here and also in
the installation process.</p>



<p>The <tt class="monofont">DefaultScale</tt> property of the counter is not
intuitive. This property specifies the power of 10 by which to scale
a chart line (i.e., the base 10 log of the scale). For example, for a
default scale of 1, you use 0. For a default scale of 10, use 1; to
get a scale of 100, use 2, etc.</p>






<h5>18.8.1.3
Updating the counters</h5>


<p>Now that you've defined the
<a nAME="idx1848"></A>counters in your code, all
that remains is to update the counters with your data. This is a
simple process. The counter object has a method
<TT cLAsS="monofont">Increment()</Tt> taking a single optional parameter
(defaulting to 1).</P>



<P>Change the <TT CLass="monofont">SvcDoRun()</tT> method, so that just before
you process the client connection, you execute the following code:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont"># But first, increment our Performance Monitor data
 self.counterConnections.Increment()</PRe>


<p>This increments the counter by 1, which is correct for your
connections counter. Then, just after you write the response to the
client, execute:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont"># Update our performance monitor "bytes read" counter
self.counterBytes.Increment(len(data))</pre>


<p>In this case, you increment the bytes counter by the length of the
data received. And that's it: your service is now providing
Performance Monitor information.</p>






<h5>18.8.1.4
Viewing Performance Monitor data</h5>


<p>
<a name="idx1849"></a>All that
remains is to view the data the service provides. The service must be
running before the data is available, so let's start the new
service:</p>



<pre CLASS="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; python PipeService2.py debug
Debugging service PythonPipeService
Info 0x40001002 - The PythonPipeService service has started.</PrE>


<P>Now you can start the Windows NT Performance Monitor, which can be
found under the Administrative Tools folder on the Start menu. You
are presented with an empty Performance Monitor that looks something
like <a href="pythonwin32_snode146.html#9">Figure 18.4</A>.</P>
