<h3>1.3
Case Studies of Python Deployment</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx93"></a>Throughout this book we will talk about
cases where Python has solved problems in the real world. Both of us
use Python in our daily work, and we will present a couple of
examples of how we are personally using Python to solve real-world
problems.</p>




<h4>1.3.1
A Japanese Python?</h4>


<P>Andy is currently working for a global investment company that is
internationalizing its core applications to work with Far Eastern
markets. The company's client platform is Windows, and core
data is stored on Sybase servers and AS400 minicomputers; data flows
back and forth among all three platforms continually. All these
systems represent Japanese characters in totally different ways and
work with different <A NAme="idx94"></a> <a NAME="idx95"></a>
<a name="idx96"></a>character
sets. It was necessary not only to develop a library to convert
between these encodings, but also to prove that it worked with 100%
effectiveness for all the data that might be encountered in future
years. This was not an easy task, as the size of the character set
varied from one platform to another.</p>



<p>The first stage was to code the conversions in Python, based on
published algorithms and lookup tables. The interactive prompt lets
you look at the input and output strings early on and get all the
details right working with single, short strings. I then developed
classes to represent character sets and character maps and fed in the
published government character sets—easy to do with
Python's lists and dictionaries. I found subtle holes in
published information and was able to correct for them. Having done
this, I was able to prove that round-trip conversion was possible in
many cases and to identify the characters that would not survive a
round trip in others.</p>



<p>The company's cross-platform C++ guru then wrote a DLL to carry
out string translations at high speed. Having a Python prototype
allowed me to test the output early and compare it with the
prototype. Python also generated and inspected test data sets with
every valid character, something that would have taken months by
hand. A Python wrapper was written around the DLL, and I wrote
scripts to perform heavy-duty tests on it, feeding large customer
databases through all possible conversions and back to the start.
Naturally the tests uncovered bugs, but I found them in two days
rather than in months.</p>



<p>The DLL was then put to work converting large amounts of report data
from mainframe to PC formats. A Python program called the DLL to
perform translations of individual strings; it scanned for files,
decided what to do with them based on the names, broke them up,
converted them a field at a time, and managed FTP sessions to send
the data on to a destination database server. It also generated a web
page for each file translated, displaying its contents in an
easy-to-read table along with the results of basic integrity checks.
This enabled users on two continents to test the data daily. When the
data and algorithms were fully tested and known to be in their final
shape, a fairly junior developer with six month's experience
wrote the eventual C++ program in less than a week.</p>







<h4>1.3.2
There's a Python on the Scoreboard!</h4>


<p>A number of large sports stadiums in Australia (including the two
largest, with 100,000-person capacities) run custom
<a namE="idx97"></A>scoreboard-control software during all
matches. The software keeps and displays the score for the games
(including personal player information) and displays other messages
and advertising during matches. The information is relayed to huge
video scoreboards, as well as smaller strip scoreboards located
around the ground and locally to the scorers' PC using HTML.</P>



<P>The system runs on Windows NT computers and needs to talk to a
variety of custom software and hardware, including a custom input
device for score keeping and custom hardware to control the video and
strip scoreboards. The system also needs to read data during the game
from an external database that provides detailed game statistics for
each player.</P>



<P>The scoreboard software is written in C++ and Python. The C++
components of the system are responsible for keeping the match score
and maintaining the key score database. All scoreboard output
functionality is written in Python and exposes Python as a macro
language.</p>



<P>Each output device (e.g., the video screen, strip scoreboard, or HTML
file) has a particular "language" that controls the
output. HTML, for example, uses &lt;TAGS&gt;, while the video
scoreboard uses a formatting language somewhat similar to PostScript.
A common thread is that all output formats are text-based.</P>



<p>A scheme has been devised that allows the scoreboard operator to
embed Python code in the various layout formats. As the format is
displayed, the Python code is executed to substitute the actual
score. For example, the scoreboard operator may design a HTML page
with code similar to:</P>



<PrE CLASS="monofont">&lt;P&gt;The player name is &lt;I&gt;&lt;%= player.Name %&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</pre>


<p>Anything within the <TT CLass="monofont">&lt;%</tT>
<A NAme="idx98"></a> <tT CLAss="monofont">...%&gt;</tt> tag is
considered Python code, and the value substituted at runtime. Thus,
this single HTML layout can display the information for any player in
the game.</p>



<p>The nature of Python has allowed it to provide features that would
not be possible using other languages. One such feature is that the
scoreboard operator is free to create new database fields for a
player using <a name="idx99"></a>Microsoft Access and use them in the
scoreboard layouts immediately using
<tt class="monofont">player.FieldName</tt> syntax; thus the object model
exposed to the user is actually partially controlled by the user. The
use of Python also allows arbitrary code to be executed to control
the formatting. For example, the scoreboard operator may use the
following HTML to display the list of players in the home team:</P>



<PRE CLaSS="monofont">&lt;P&gt;Team &lt;% = home.Name %&gt;
&lt;% for player in home.Players: %&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;%= player.Name %&gt;
&lt;% #end %&gt;</pRE>


<p>These options have resulted in a situation programmers strive for,
but see all too rarely: a system with enough flexibility to let users
do things with your software you'd never have dreamt of.</P>







<H4>1.3.3
Other Python Sightings in the Wild</H4>


<P>To further dispel any impressions that Python is new, immature, or
unsuited to critical applications, we've included a small
selection of projects and organizations using Python in the real
world. These have been culled from a much longer list on the main
Python web site,

language for its Integrated Planning System.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UltraSeek Server, Infoseek's commercial web search engine, is
implemented as a Python application, with some C extensions to
provide primitive operations for fast indexing and searching. The
core product involves 11,000 lines of Python, and the user interface
consists of 17,000 lines of Python-scripted HTML templates.</p>

<li><P>Caligari Corporation's 3D modeling and animation package,
trueSpace 4, uses Python as a scripting language. Users can create
custom modeling and animation effects, write interactive
applications, and develop game prototypes entirely inside trueSpace
4. We'll show you how to do something similar for your own
applications in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode47.html">Part II</a>.</P>
