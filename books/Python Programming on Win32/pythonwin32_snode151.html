<h3>19.1
Serial Communications</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1856"></a>
<a naME="idx1857"></A>
<A name="idx1858"></A>The serial port has been a part
of the standard PC since its inception, and a wide range of PC
accessories, scientific, and medical devices use it; modems and mice
are the most common. Recently, infrared ports have been gaining in
popularity, and these are essentially just serial ports without
wires. We will learn a little about serial ports and use that to talk
to some external devices.</P>




<H4>19.1.1
How COM Ports Are Accessed</H4>


<p>
<a name="idx1859"></a>Serial data
is carried as a sequence of high and low voltages over a number of
wires with fairly precise timing characteristics. Fortunately for the
programmer, it isn't necessary to know much about how serial
ports work. Under DOS, you had to work with a very low-level
interface; a certain range of bytes (starting at 0x03F8 for COM1 and
0x02F8 for COM2) contained information about the serial port. Your
program would loop continually checking the values of bits and bytes
in this region; some of these signaled the arrival of data, others
the data values itself, and others error values. It was messy and
painful to program.</p>



<p>Windows 3.1 exposed a higher-level API, with a layer of buffering;
functions such as <tt class="monofont">ReadComm</tt> and
<tt cLASS="monofont">WriteComm</TT> that provide insulation from the
hardware and a somewhat file-like interface; and event-driven
communications, which allowed you to have messages sent to a window
when data arrived at the COM port. Windows NT drops the windows
message concept and completes the move to a file-like interface,
using the same functions to open, read and write COM ports as regular
files. It also prevents programs from accessing the serial port
(i.e., those previous addresses) directly.</p>




<H5>19.1.1.1
Timing issues</H5>


<p>Example programs give the impression of reading and writing from
files, but this can be misleading. Files on the disk are all there at
once, and you know when you have got to the end. Furthermore, if you
open a file for reading and/or writing, you know where you are in the
file, and the disk operations take place in exactly the order you
specify. Serial I/O is all about timing. Consider a port running at
9600 bits per second on a Pentium 400. One byte arrives every
millisecond; your computer can execute more than a hundred thousand
instructions between each byte arriving. Your PC can also wander off
and do something else (load a file, wait for the user, open a Word
document or something) while several bytes arrive at the port
unnoticed.</P>



<P>To resolve this, the operating system provides input and output
buffers. A typical size is 1024 bytes. If your program is doing
something else, up to 1024 bytes will accumulate and be saved for
you, so you don't have to check the port continually. If you
read from the port, it returns as many bytes as you asked for from
the buffer or nothing if there is no more data. There is no way to
know whether data has finished arriving, or whether more might arrive
in another millisecond; each application needs to define a
<i>protocol</I> so that the application knows whether
to wait for more or to stop listening. Protocols can involve
fixed-size transmissions, the use of delimiters such as a carriage
return to say "this message has finished arriving," or
time limits.</P>



<P>If you want to work at a low level, you can use the
<TT Class="monofont">CreateFile</TT> API call exposed by the Python Win32
extensions, passing in a filename of "COM1" or
"COM2." You can then read from and write to this file.
Communications functions are well documented in the MSDN Library.
However, for common tasks, there are easier ways to do it.
We'll look at two of them, using a public domain C-level
extension package and a proprietary COM interface.</P>

The Serial Module</h4>


<p>
<a nAME="idx1860"></A> <a namE="idx1861"></A>Our preferred route for serial I/O
with Python is Roger <A Name="idx1862"></a>Burnham's <tt class="monofont">Serial</tt>
package. This is free and comes with an installer and several
examples.</p>



<p>The <tt clasS="monofont">Serial</TT> package is based on a set of serial
communications libraries developed by
<A NAmE="idx1863"></A>MarshallSoft
(<a NAmE="idx1864"></A>
<A NAMe="idx1865"></a><a tARGEt="_blank" hreF="http://www.marshallsoft.com/default.htm">www.marshallsoft.com</A>) over the last eight
years. These libraries are available as a 16- and 32-bit DLL with
identical interfaces, which makes it easy to migrate applications
from 16- to 32-bit and back again.<FOnt siZE="1"><SUp><a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></sup></font>
 The libraries
are available as shareware packages for Visual Basic, C, and Delphi.
MarshallSoft have kindly allowed their DLL to be used free of charge
as part of the Python package provided a brief message is included
with any distribution. The core DLL is not Open Source but has been
heavily tested and won several awards.</p>

It would be nice
to think 16-bit Windows was dead in 1999, but you would be amazed how
many cash-strapped hospitals and university laboratories still have
old Windows 3.1 PCs collecting data.</p>
</FONT></blocKQUOte>





<p>The <tt class="monofont">Serial</tt> package uses <a name="idx1866"></a>SWIG (see <a href="pythonwin32_cnode170.html">Chapter 22</A> ) to create a Python DLL wrapper around the
library, and provides easy-to-use Python wrappers and examples. The
Python wrapper class is Open Source and provides a simple high-level
API that simplifies many common communications tasks. The
<TT ClASs="monofont">Serial</TT> package provides functions to open and
close serial ports and to read and write from them.</p>




<H5>19.1.2.1
The art of telephone conversation</H5>


<P>
<A NAme="idx1867"></a>The
"Hello, World" of the communications field is to send an
<tT CLAss="monofont">AT</tt> command to a modem and get back a response, so
we will take care of this formality first. If you are not familiar
with <A NAMe="idx1868"></a>modems, they
almost all speak a common command language defined by Hayes; the
computer sends a line of text beginning with the letters
<tt CLASs="monofont">AT</tt> and ending in a carriage return and linefeed,
and the modem sends back a line of text with a response. In
particular, the command <tt class="monofont">ATI</tt> asks a modem to
identify itself.</p>



<p>We tried hard to find a way of making this more interesting. Instead
of using a conventional internal or external modem, we decided to
make a laptop to talk to a mobile phone with a built-in modem, via
its infrared port. It turned out that this didn't involve any
special programming at all (IR ports are just plain old serial ports
from the programmer's viewpoint) but it does far more to
satisfy technolust! The console session below shows a basic
conversation with the modem, which was sitting a few feet away:</p>



<pre claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Serial import Serial
&gt;&gt;&gt; # create a 'configuration dictionary' with the port settings
&gt;&gt;&gt; myconfig = Serial.PortDict()
&gt;&gt;&gt; myconfig['port'] = Serial.COM4
&gt;&gt;&gt; # create and open a port with these settings
&gt;&gt;&gt; myport = Serial.Port(myconfig)
&gt;&gt;&gt; myport.open()
&gt;&gt;&gt; myport.send('ATI\015') #ask modem to identify itself
&gt;&gt;&gt; print myport.read() #get back any response
ATI

Ericsson SH 888 Infrared Modem
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Python supports Infrared!  Cool!</PRE>


<P>The <tT ClASs="monofont">Serial</TT> package contains two classes. A
<TT CLass="monofont">PortDict</tT>
<A NAme="idx1869"></a> holds the configuration information
needed to begin using a serial port; this comes with a sensible set
of defaults, and is smart enough to check the values you assign it.
If you ask it to display itself at a command prompt, you can see all
the parameters, many of which are self-explanatory:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; myconfig
&lt;Serial Config:
   baud = 9600
   cmdTerm = ''
   cmdsEchoed = 0
   dataBits = 8
   debug = 0
   parity = None
   port = COM4
   rspFixedLen = 0
   rspTerm = ''
   rspTermPat = None
   rspType = RSP_BEST_EFFORT
   rxBufSize = 1024
   stopBits = 1
   timeOutMs = 500
   txBufSize = 1024
&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<P>This is passed as an argument to the constructor of a
<tt class="monofont">Port</tt>
<a name="idx1870"></a> object, which manages the conversation.
You've just seen the key methods of a Port object:
<tt clasS="monofont">open()</TT>, <TT ClASs="monofont">read()</TT>,
<tT CLASS="monofont">write()</tt>, and <tt CLASs="monofont">close()</tt>. We relate
what they do in more detail later.</p>



<P>The most widely available serial devices are mice and modems;
however, there is not much likelihood you will need to write a driver
for either, so we'll look instead at some laboratory
instruments that together illustrate some key principles. The first
stage in talking to any remote device is to learn about its
communications protocol and think through the timing issues involved.</P>



<P>
<A name="idx1871"></A>Andy maintains a data-analysis package for
two devices called the <I>Mark III</I> and
<I>Mark IV GastrograpH</i>, made by Medical Instruments
Corporation of Switzerland. These are used to diagnose chronic
stomach pain; patients have a probe inserted into their stomachs, and
carry a small battery-powered device for 24 hours that captures the
pH values, as well as user-input information about meals, sleep and
pain. At the end of the 24-hour period, the data is downloaded to a
PC. Fortunately it comes with a test signal generator, which removed
the need to self-intubate while writing this chapter!</p>






<h5>19.1.2.2
The Mark III: Reading large amounts of data</h5>


<p>
<a name="idx1872"></a>The Mark III GastrograpH is a
very simple instrument from a communication viewpoint. You press a
transmit button, and it sends a fixed-size block of data (essentially
dumping the contents of its RAM). It neither knows nor cares if there
is a PC listening at the far end.</p>



<p>The port settings are 9600 baud, eight data bits, one stop bit, and
no parity. One byte of data thus needs 9 bits (8 data + 1 stop), so
you can expect about 1067 bytes per second (9600 / (8+1)) or one per
millisecond. The device sends a header of 22 bytes, followed by 24
separate blocks of 4102 bytes each (each of these is 4 KB of RAM plus
a few checksums), totaling exactly 98,470 bytes. Between each block
there is a 200ms pause. The whole download takes about 97 seconds.</p>



<p>Let's use the
<tt clasS="monofont">Serial</TT>
<A NAmE="idx1873"></A> class to capture this data. The
<tT ClASS="monofont">read()</TT>
<A name="idx1874"></A> method we saw earlier is actually
extremely flexible; the full header is
<TT Class="monofont">read(</TT><TT clasS="monofont"><I>cnt=None,</I></Tt>
<tt class="monofont"><i>timed= FALSE</i></tt>). When you initialize a
<tt class="monofont">Serial</tt> class instance, you specify a timeout,
which has a default value of half a second. The read method can be
used in three totally different ways:</P>



<UL>
<LI><P><tT ClASs="monofont">MySerialPort.read()</TT> returns any data that has
arrived at the serial port since you last called
<TT CLass="monofont">read()</tT> or since it was opened. The data is
returned as a string.</P>
</LI>
<li><p><tT CLAss="monofont">MySerialPort.read(1024)</tt> reads 1024 bytes from the
serial port, waiting all night if necessary.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p><tt class="monofont">MySerialPort.read(1024,</tt>
<tt class="monofont">timed=1)</tt> reads 1024 bytes from the serial port, or
raise an error if that many bytes haven't arrived before the
timeout limit. The default timeout is half a second, which is ample
time to receive short responses from most devices. You can specify a
timeout of up to 60 seconds when initializing a port.</p>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The first approach that occurred to us was to change one line of
<I>Serial.py</i> to allow a two-minute timeout and read
the whole lot in one command. That works, but is not desperately
user-friendly; if the device isn't transmitting, you still have
to wait two minutes to find out. Instead, we grabbed it in a number
of chunks matching the device protocol itself. Each takes about four
seconds to arrive, so set a timeout of 10 seconds. This should be
long enough for the user to start Python listening, then hit the
Transmit button on the device. Here's the capture function:</P>



<PrE ClASS="monofont">from Serial import Serial
import traceback
import string

def captureMark3Data(port=Serial.COM3):
    
    #fill a config dictionary with the settings we want
    cfg = Serial.PortDict()
    cfg['port'] = port
    cfg['baud'] = Serial.Baud9600
    cfg['parity'] = Serial.NoParity
    cfg['stopBits'] = Serial.OneStopBit
    cfg['timeOutMs'] = 10000   # ten seconds
    
    # create a Port object based on these settings
    prt = Serial.Port(cfg)
    prt.open()
    
    print 'Port open...'
    
    blocks = []
    #read some data
    try:
        # first section is 22 bytes, followed by a pause
        header = prt.read(22,timed=1)
        blocks.append(header)
        print 'read header'
        
        # followed by 24 blocks of 4102 bytes, and pauses
        for i in range(24):
            block = prt.read(4102, timed=1)
            blocks.append(block)
            print 'read block',i,'of 24'
        
        prt.close()
        alldata = string.join(blocks, '')
        return alldata
        
    except:   
        # close the port but print the error message
        prt.close()
        traceback.print_exc()
        return None</PRE>


<p>Note that a
<tt cLASS="monofont">try...except...</tt>
<a nAME="idx1875"></A> handler was used to ensure that the
port is always closed. Leaving a COM port open prevents other
programs (or your own) from using it for some time; on Windows 95,
this can persist until a reboot.</p>



<p>The first thing to do is try running the function without even
connecting the GastrograpH<i> </i>to the port. This
results in a timeout error after ten seconds, which is handled
gracefully:</P>



<PRE class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import commdemos
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = commdemos.captureMark3Data()
Port open...
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "C:\Data\Project\OReilly\chXX_Communications\examples\

  File "C:\Program Files\Python\Serial\Serial.py", line 456, in read
    raise SioError, \
SioError: Timed out waiting for input chr 0 of 22, read ''.
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Having done that, you can try it for real. Call the function; then
press Transmit:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import commdemos
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = commdemos.captureMark3Data()

&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>





<H5>19.1.2.3
The Mark IV and dialogs</H5>


<P>The Mark III downloaded its whole memory. Capturing data was trivial;
deciphering it was a lot of work. The Mark IV GastrograpH, which
replaces the Mark III, communicates in a different way and aims to
return meaningful information. The protocol is simple: you send one
byte, and it replies with another in three to four milliseconds.
There are about 20 separate requests you can make; one request
returns start date information, another returns the next byte in a
time series, and so on. This is another common serial programming
paradigm; you send a short sequence and get something back promptly.
This enables us to talk to the device at the command prompt. Note
that you need to specify <TT ClASs="monofont">timed=1</TT> so that Python
waits for a response; otherwise, it reads an empty string from the
port long before the device has time to respond.</p>



<P>The <TT CLAss="monofont">Serial.Port</tt>
<A NAMe="idx1876"></a> class has a method to send a command and
get a response that is highly configurable, but doesn't do
quite what you want. Let's make a subclass that has a method to
carry out the kind of dialog we want:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">class Mark4Port(Serial.Port):
    def talk(self, byte):
        #send a byte, wait up to 500ms for one byte back
        self.write(chr(byte))
        resp = self.read(cnt=1,timed=1)
        return ord(resp[0])</pRE>


<P>The needed dialog requires only one three-line method. Armed with
this, you can talk to the device on the command prompt in real time:</P>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Serial import Serial
&gt;&gt;&gt; cfg = Serial.PortDict()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cfg['baud']=Serial.Baud19200
&gt;&gt;&gt; cfg['port']=Serial.COM3
&gt;&gt;&gt; M4 = commdemos.Mark4Port(cfg)
&gt;&gt;&gt; M4.open()
&gt;&gt;&gt; M4.talk(2)     # how many hours recording planned?
24
&gt;&gt;&gt; M4.talk(10)    # how many hours took place?
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; M4.talk(9)     # how many minutes took place?
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; M4.close()
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>When you have limited documentation, the ability to interrogate a
device in interactive mode like this is a real help.</p>






<h5>19.1.2.4
Of mice and modems</h5>


<p>Naturally, you won't have either of these devices available,
but there are two things you can play with quite easily: serial mice
and modems. With a mouse, all you need is a loop that listens to the
port and displays the bytes that are generated whenever you move it.
Furthermore, if you look around, a growing number of peripherals and
palmtop computers offer infrared ports, and it can be fun (and
potentially even useful) to attempt to talk to them.<a name="idx1877"></A> <A NAME="idx1878"></a></P>








<H4>19.1.3
The Microsoft Communications Control (MSComm)</h4>


<P>
<A nAME="idx1879"></A> <A Name="idx1880"></a>Microsoft has provided a
COM interface to the serial port in the form of an OCX. This gives
less detailed control than the Python <TT CLass="monofont">Serial</tT>
package, but is adequate for the kind of examples above. It's
distributed with Visual Basic, Visual Studio, and most Microsoft
development tools; you need one of these packages to redistribute it.
In a corporate setting this isn't usually a problem. Unlike the
<TT Class="monofont">Serial</TT> package, it requires the Python COM
framework. Let's talk to a modem with it, this time reverting
to a plain old system connected with real wires:</P>



<Pre class="monofont">def MSCommDemo():
    #talks to a modem on COM1
    from win32com.client import Dispatch
    comm = Dispatch('MSCOMMLib.MSComm')
    comm.CommPort = 1    #COM1
    comm.PortOpen = 1
    try:
        comm.Output = "AT\015"               # add a carriage return
        inbuf = ''
        now = time.time()
        elapsed = time.time() - now
        while (string.find(inbuf, 'OK') &lt; 0) and (elapsed &lt; 2):
            inbuf = inbuf + str(comm.Input)  #remember the Unicode string!
            elapsed = time.time() - now
        print inbuf
    finally:
        comm.PortOpen = 0</pre>


<p>When run, you should see your command of <tt class="monofont">AT</tt>
echoed, followed by the response <tT CLASS="monofont">OK</tT>. Note that you
don't know how long it will take to respond, so you loop until
you get the desired data or until some time limit has elapsed. This
behavior was wrapped for us by <I>Serial.py</i>, and
you could wrap it here as well if you were going to use the
<TT cLASS="monofont">MSComm</TT> control a lot.</p>



<p>One truly amazing thing about the <tt CLASs="monofont">MSComm</tt> control
is the syntax. Microsoft loves properties; we saw that the Excel and
Word object models used property assignments for lots of things, but
this control takes it to new limits. <tT CLAss="monofont">MSComm</tt> has
no—count 'em—no methods. One major reason for using
properties is that they can be set at design time in the Visual Basic
development environment, but the key properties are runtime only. You
can argue that a <TT CLass="monofont">PortOpen</tt> property has its uses;
you can at least query it. Assigning a string to a write-only
<tt class="monofont">Input</tt> property, instead of providing a
<tt class="monofont">Write()</TT> method, is weird. Getting a return value
from an <TT CLaSS="monofont">Output</tT> property, and being able to ask for
it only once, is even less natural. We can't see any design
rationale behind this. Nevertheless, it works.<A nAME="idx1881"></A><A Name="idx1882"></a> <A NAMe="idx1883"></a> <a nAME="idx1884"></A></p>
