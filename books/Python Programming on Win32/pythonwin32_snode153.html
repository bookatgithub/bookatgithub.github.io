<H3>19.3
Sockets</H3>


<P>
<A name="idx1892"></A>
<A NAme="idx1893"></a>
<a NAME="idx1894"></a>Our
third and final topic under the theme of communications is the
Sockets API. This is the programmer's interface to the
<a name="idx1895"></a>TCP/IP
protocol itself. Sockets are supported by all major operating
systems, via a standard C-level interface. This interface is
available in Python on all platforms, enabling you to write custom
communications protocols. <a href="pythonwin32_cnode117.html">Chapter 15</a>, describes a
number of Python library modules that implement the standard
protocols. The Python standard library contains many examples of how
to write applications using sockets.</p>



<p>The key concepts bear some similarity to the serial communications we
saw earlier: there is a file-like interface that permits reading and
writing, and the same issue of not knowing when a transmission has
finished. However, you can't guarantee a response in a given
timeframe, and indeed responses on the Internet can vary widely from
fractions of a second up to several seconds.</p>



<p>Sockets are great fun to experiment with, particularly in Python,
where the client socket can be scripted from an interactive console
session. Ideally you need two computers close to each other on the
same TCP/IP network; however, one machine works fine as long as it
has TCP/IP installed. Sockets can communicate between processes on
the same machine.</p>




<h4>19.3.1
A Simple Socket Server</h4>


<p>
<A NAME="idx1896"></A>The following function implements a short
socket server:</p>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont"># socketserver1.py - runs forever,
# reverse each message received.
from socket import *
import string

HOST = ''     # this means local
PORT = 8578   #arbitrary, high number

def serve():
    # this reverses each message received, lasts forever
    serversock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    serversock.bind((HOST, PORT))
    serversock.listen(1)   # max bcklog of 1-5 connections
    print 'socket listening for connections...'
    while 1:
        handlersock, addr = serversock.accept()  

        # now do something with the handler socket
        print 'handler connected by', addr
        data = handlersock.recv(1024)
        print 'received', data
        handlersock.send(string.upper(data))
        handlersock.close()
        print 'handler closed'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    serve()</PRE>


<P>You can start this server by running it from a DOS prompt.
Let's step through a line at a time:</p>



<dl>
<dT>
<FONt colOR="#990000"><FOnt coLOR="#990000"><Span class="monofont">serversock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)</span></font>
</font></dT>
<DD>
<P>This creates the server socket. Don't worry about the
constants; there are other types of sockets, but their use is unusual
and definitely out of scope for this chapter.</P>
</Dd>
<DT>
<fONt COLOR="#990000"><Font cOLOR="#990000"><span CLASs="monofont">serversock.bind(HOST, PORT)</spaN></FONt>
</font></dt>
<dd>
<p>This associates the socket with a TCP/IP hostname and port number. An
empty string, the hostname (if you know it), or the result of the
function <tt class="monofont">gethostname()</tt> all mean the local machine.
<tt CLASS="monofont">PORT</Tt> is a number between
and 65535 and can be thought of like a radio channel or telephone
line. The lower port numbers are used for standard services, so pick
a big one.</P>
</Dd>
<DT>
<fONT COLor="#990000"><foNT COlor="#990000"><sPAN Class="monofont">serversock.listen(1)</SPAN></font>
</font></dt>
<dd>
<p>This places the socket in a passive state and specifies a backlog of
connections. We have told it that only one connection at a time is
allowed; you can specify up to five. For socket applications use
short-lived connections, this is usually plenty; the network buffers
requests from subsequent sockets so that the server only has to deal
with one at a time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<p>We now go into a loop. The server socket runs until you kill the
process. The next line is where the action happens:</p>



<dL>
<DT>
<FONt COlOR="#990000"><fONT COLor="#990000"><spAN CLass="monofont">handlersock, addr = serversock.accept()</sPAN></Font>
</fONT></Dt>
<dd>
<p>At this point the program waits until a connection is received from a
<i>client socket</i> somewhere else on the network.
This could be some time. We'll look at the client side in a
moment. When a client does connect, the network software creates a
totally new socket, which we will call a <i>handler
socket</i>. We are also passed the address of the socket on
the far end of the connection. The handler socket is a totally
different beast from the server socket; in some ways it's a
pity they are implemented as the same object. In fact, it's
identical to the client socket we will look at in a moment. The two
are welded together, with the input of one hooked up to the output of
the other. They are also communicating on another network port to the
one we originally specified, something assigned randomly by TCP/IP.
The original server socket can continue listening on the specified
port.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<p>At this point, it doesn't really matter what the client and
handler sockets do. The server socket has handled the request, the
incoming port is free, and it's now free (in theory) to handle
the next incoming request. A more complex server than ours might
actually set up a separate thread to handle the request.</p>



<p>Now let's pop over to the client side and see what is going on
there. We've implemented the client side of the conversation
from a console session:</p>



<pre cLASS="monofont">[CLIENT]
&gt;&gt;&gt; from socket import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; clientsock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
&gt;&gt;&gt; clientsock.connect('tahoe',8578)
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRe>


<P>The <Tt CLaSS="monofont">connect method</TT> can take the
name of the machine or the IP address (represented as the usual
dotted string), or <TT clasS="monofont">"localhost"</TT> if you are talking
to yourself on one machine. If you don't get an error message,
you're connected. Now let's look back at the console for
the server:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">[SERVER]
D:\Examples\Comms&gt;python socketserver1.py
socket listening for connections...
handler connected by ('192.42.172.3', 1029)</pre>


<p>This identifies the machine from which the connection arrived, and
the port on which the client socket and handler socket are now
talking.</P>



<P>The client is in position to send requests to the handler socket and
hold a conversation. We've provided a simplistic example; the
client sends a short string, and the server sends it back in
uppercase. After one such exchange, the two sockets close. This is
dangerously simplistic (we'll discover why later). Now they can
talk; it's back to the client side:</P>



<Pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; clientsock.send('hello')    # returns bytes sent
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; clientsock.recv(1024)      # max bytes to receive
'HELLO'
&gt;&gt;&gt; clientsock.close()
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>The conversation is over, and the server socket is now ready to
accept and process the next request. It's essential to close
down sockets when finished by calling the <tt class="monofont">close()</tt>
method. This notifies the remote socket that no more data will be
sent. If your program fails to close a socket cleanly, the one at the
far end of the connection may hang indefinitely.<a NAME="idx1897"></A></P>







<h4>19.3.2
Communication Between Sockets</H4>


<P>
<a NAmE="idx1898"></A>
<A NAMe="idx1899"></a>The previous example covered the key
features of how sockets get connected, but was dangerously simple. We
sent a very short string, then waited a couple of seconds while we
typed the call to receive a response. We got back the expected data,
but were lucky: in real life, there's more to worry about.</p>



<p>The <TT CLass="monofont">send()</tT> call doesn't instantly send a
string, however long. It tries to send the string and returns the
number of bytes sent. With a big string (e.g., a file-transfer
application) or in bad network conditions, the
<TT Class="monofont">send()</TT> call sends only a small part on each call.
It might also return zero, which indicates that the network
connection has been broken. The only safe way to send a string is to
do it in a loop and check the return values to see what has actually
been sent. Here's a function to send an arbitrary string
safely:</P>



<Pre class="monofont"># this sends strings over sockets more safely
def safeSend(sock, message):
    msglen = len(message)
    totalsent = 0
    while totalsent &lt; msglen:
        sent = sock.send(msg[totalsent:])
        if sent == 0:
            raise RuntimeError, 'connection broken'
        totalsent = totalsent + sent</pre>


<p>At this point you've hit a fundamental problem. There is no way
for the receiving socket to know how much data to expect, nor whether
a message has finished arriving. You have to design your protocol so
that client and handler know what to expect at every stage. There are
several schemes for doing this:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>Always use fixed-size messages.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Add a final delimiter.</P>
</LI>
<Li><P>Indicate how long messages are.</P>
</lI>
<Li><P>Send once and shut down. The receiving socket loops until it receives
a zero and knows it's done.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<p>One effective scheme is to make the first byte of each message a code
indicating the type of message and to have a standard length for each
message type, padding messages if needed. Another is to send a
fixed-length message on the first exchange and include in each
exchange the length of the subsequent message. Once you've
designed a protocol, you can write a <tt cLASS="monofont">safeReceive</tt>
procedure to match it and ensure you get all of the data. Note that
you can send <a nAME="idx1900"></A>binary data safely over sockets.</p>







<h4>19.3.3
Where to Go from Here</h4>


<p>The design here works for short-lived connections and low traffic. If
you want to handle multiple simultaneous requests, there are several
different strategies, but they all involve quite a bit of work. One
option is to create separate threads to handle each request (look in
the <TT CLass="monofont">thread</tt> and <tt class="monofont">threading</tt>
modules in the Python Library Reference). Another is to use
nonblocking sockets and the <tt class="monofont">select</TT><I>
</I>statement, which looks at a bunch of sockets and tells you
which have data ready to read or are ready to accept outgoing
data.<FOnT SiZE="1"><sUP><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></suP></FONt>
</p>


<blOCKQuote><FONT size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></suP>
Note that on Unix, <TT CLAsS="monofont">select()</Tt>
can work with file descriptors as well as sockets; on Windows, it
works only with sockets.</P>
</FoNT></BLOCkquoTE>





<P>We won't go any further into building sockets applications
here. We've gone about as far as we can simply, and it gets
more complex from here on.</P>



<p>Fortunately the work has been done for you. The Python standard
library module
<i>socketserver.py</i>
<a NAME="idx1901"></a> provides an extremely useful generic
server architecture. It includes a generic server class that you
might or might not need to subclass and a request-handler class you
definitely want to override. This is an excellent place to go next.
Several other standard library modules define web servers based on
the standard socket server.</p>



<p>We hope we have made it clear that sockets programming is not only
feasible but also straightforward on Python. It's comparatively
rare to need to develop your own socket-based protocols, and if you
do need to do it, you will know far more about the subject than we
can cover here.</p>



<P>World-class networking software has been developed in Python;
examples include the Infoseek search engine, Zope, and
Medusa<A NAme="idx1902"></a> <a name="idx1903"></a> <a name="idx1904"></a>. Zope and Medusa are discussed
briefly in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode24.html">Chapter 3</a>.</P>
