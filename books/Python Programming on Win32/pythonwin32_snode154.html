Other Communications Tools</H3>



<H4>19.4.1
Named Pipes</H4>


<p>
<a naME="idx1905"></A>We ought to quickly mention named pipes
again. These are a Microsoft technology similar to sockets and have
been part of Windows NT since its inception. As with sockets and
serial ports, you read and write to named pipes. You open them by
passing a suitable network path to <Tt claSS="monofont">CreateFile</TT> of
the form <i>\\mymachine\pipe\mypipe</i>.
Named pipes function over whatever network protocol NT is using; it
might be TCP/IP, IPX, or NetBEUI. On Windows, they operate slightly
faster than sockets and can also be secured. They are extensively
used by Microsoft's networking APIs and back office products.</p>



<p>About the only reason to use named pipes is for their integrated
<a name="idx1906"></a>security. Named pipes are fully securable
by Windows NT, and you can rely on Windows reporting a valid and
authenticated user at the other end of the pipe. For most
communications applications that don't have a high requirement
for security, sockets are often simpler to use, and have the added
advantage of being cross-platform.</p>







<h4>19.4.2
Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1907"></a>
<a NAME="idx1908"></A>RPC is a communications technology
originally developed by the DCE consortium. It builds on top of a
network protocol such as TCP/IP to provide the ability to call
functions on remote machines. When you design a client/server socket
application, you work hard to get to the point where you can send a
request to a remote object and get a response reliably. In our case,
what we wanted was a remote function to reverse strings, not a load
of messages. RPC handles all this, and is supported by Windows. It
lets you build tightly coupled client and server applications.</P>



<p>On Windows, Distributed COM (which builds on top of RPC) has made the
RPC programming interface pretty much obsolete. Python supports DCOM
rather than RPC. For details, see <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</a>.</P>
