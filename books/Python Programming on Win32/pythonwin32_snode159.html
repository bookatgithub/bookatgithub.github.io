Tkinter</H3>


<P>
<A name="idx1916"></A> <A NAme="idx1917"></a><i>Tkinter</I> is the
Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit current maintained by
Scriptics <A NAme="idx1918"></a>(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.scriptics.com/default.htm">http://www.scriptics.com</a>). Tkinter has become
the de facto standard GUI toolkit for Python due mainly to its
cross-platform capabilities; it presents a powerful and adaptable GUI
model across the major Python platforms, including Windows 95/98/NT,
the Macintosh, and most Unix implementations and Linux distributions.</p>



<p>This section gives a short description of the capabilities of
Tkinter, and provides a whirlwind tour of the more important aspects
of the Tkinter framework. To effectively use Tkinter, you need a more
thorough description than is provided for here. Fredrik
<a namE="idx1919"></A>Lundh has
made an excellent introduction to Tkinter programming available at
<A TARgET="_blank" hREf="http://www.pythonware.com/library.htm">http://www.pythonware.com/library.htm</A>, and at
time of printing a Tkinter book by Fredrik has just been announced,
so may be available by the time you read this. For more advanced uses
of Tkinter, you may need to refer directly to the Tk reference
manual, available from the Scriptics site.</P>



<P>Two Python applications,
<A NAme="idx1920"></a>tkBrowser and
<a NAME="idx1921"></a>tkDemo, accompany
this section. TkBrowser is a Doubletalk application, providing
several views and some small editing capabilities of Doubletalk
<tt cLASS="monofont">BookSet</tt>s; TkDemo demonstrates a simple use of the
core Tk user interface elements. Both applications are too large to
include in their entirety, so where relevant, we include snippets.</p>




<h4>20.1.1
Terminology</H4>


<P>There's some new terminology with Tkinter, defined here for
clarity:</P>

<h4>20.1.2
Pros and Cons of Tkinter</h4>


<p>
<a naME="idx1925"></A>Before we launch into Tkinter programming,
a brief discussion of the pros and cons of Tkinter will help you
decide if Tkinter may be the correct GUI toolkit for your
application. The following are often given as advantages of Tkinter:</P>



<DL>
<dT>
<I><fONt COLOR="#990000">Brevity</Font></i></DT>
<DD>
<p>Python programs using Tkinter can be very brief, partly because of
the power of Python, but also due to Tk. In particular, reasonable
default values are defined for many options used in creating a
widget, and packing it (i.e., placing and displaying).</p>
</dd>
<DT>
<I><Font cOLOR="#990000">Cross platform</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Tk provides widgets on Windows, Macs, and most Unix implementations
with very little platform-specific dependence. Some newer GUI
frameworks are achieving a degree of platform independence, but it
will be some time before they match Tk's in this respect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><font cOLOR="#990000">Maturity</FOnT></I></dT>
<Dd>
<P>First released in 1990, the core is well developed and stable.</P>
</DD>
<DT>
<i><fonT COLor="#990000">Extensibility</foNT></I></Dt>
<dd>
<p>Many extensions of Tk exist, and more are being frequently
distributed on the Web. Any extension is immediately accessible from
Tkinter, if not through an extension to Tkinter, than at least
through Tkinter's access to the Tcl language.</P>
</DD>
</Dl>


<p>To balance things, here's a list of what's often mention
as weaknesses in Tkinter:</p>



<dl>
<dt>
<i><font color="#990000">Speed</font></I></DT>
<DD>
<P>There is some concern with the speed of Tkinter. Most calls to
Tkinter are formatted as a Tcl command (a string) and interpreted by
Tcl from where the actual Tk calls are made. This theoretical
slowdown caused by the successive execution of two interpreted
languages is rarely seen in practice and most real-world applications
spend little time communicating between the various levels of Python,
Tcl, and Tk.</p>
</DD>
<dT>
<I><fONT COLor="#990000">Tcl</foNT></I></Dt>
<dd>
<p>Python purists often balk at the need to install another (and to
some, a rival) scripting language in order to perform GUI tasks.
Consequently, there is periodic interest in removing the need for Tcl
by using Tk's C-language API directly, although no such attempt
has ever succeeded.</P>
</DD>
<Dt>
<i><foNT COlor="#990000">Tk lacks modern widgets</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>It's acknowledged that Tk presents a small basic set of widgets
and lacks a collection of modern fancy widgets. For instance, Tk
lacks paned windows, tabbed windows, progress meter widgets, and tree
hierarchy widgets. However, the power and flexibility of Tk is such
that you can easily construct new widgets from a collection of basic
widgets. This fits in especially well with the object-oriented nature
of Python.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><foNT COLOr="#990000">Native look and feel</FOnT></I></dT>
<DD>
<P>One common source of complaints is that Tkinter applications on
Windows don't look like native Windows applications. As we
shall see, the current version of Tkinter provides an interface that
should be acceptable to almost everyone except the Microsoft
marketing department, and we can expect later versions of Tkinter to
be virtually indistinguishable.</P>
</Dd>
</dl>


<p>Although many individuals could (and no doubt will) argue with some
individual points on this list, it tends to reflects the general
consensus amongst the Python community. Use this only as a guide to
assist you in your decision-making process.<A NAMe="idx1926"></a></p>







<h4>20.1.3
Running GUI Applications</H4>


<P>
<A Name="idx1927"></a> <A NAMe="idx1928"></a>
<a name="idx1929"></a>Tkinter applications are normal Python
scripts, but there are a couple of complications worth knowing about
when running graphical applications under Windows. These were
discussed in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode24.html">Chapter 3</a>, but are important enough
to reiterate here; what we say in this section applies equally to
wxPython later in this chapter.</p>



<p>The standard <i>Python.exe</i> that comes with Python
is known as a <i>console</i>
<i>application</I> (this means it has been built to
interact with a Windows console, otherwise known as a DOS box or
command prompt). Although you can execute your Tkinter programs using
<I>Python.exe</I>, your program will always be
associated with a Windows console. It works just fine, but has the
following side effects:</P>



<UL>
<lI><P>If you execute <i>Python.exe</I> from Windows Explorer,
a new empty console window is created; then the Tkinter windows are
created.</P>
</lI>
<LI><P>If you execute a Tkinter application under
<I>Python.exe</I> from a command prompt, the command
prompt doesn't return until the Tkinter application has
finished. This will be a surprise for many users, who expect that
executing a GUI program returns the command prompt immediately.</p>
</li>
</uL>
<P>To get around this problem, Python comes with a special GUI version
called
<I>Pythonw.exe</I>
<a namE="idx1930"></A>.
This is almost identical to the standard
<I>Python.exe</I>, except it's not a console
program, so doesn't suffer the problems described previously.</p>



<p>There are two drawbacks to this approach. The first is that
<i>.py</i> files are automatically associated with
<I>Python.exe</I>. As we saw in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode24.html">Chapter 3</a>, this makes it simple to execute Python
programs, but does present a problem when you want to use
<i>Pythonw.exe</i>. To solve this problem, Python
automatically associates the <i>.pyw </i>extension with
<i>Pythonw.exe </i>; thus, you can give GUI Python
applications a <i>.pyw</i> extension, and automatically
execute them from Windows Explorer, the command prompt, and so forth.</p>



<p>The second drawback is that because <i>Pythonw.exe</i>
has no console, any tracebacks printed by Python aren't
typically seen. Although Python prints the traceback normally, the
lack of a console means it has nowhere useful to go. To get around
this problem, you may like to develop your application using
<i>Python.exe </i>(where the console is an advantage
for debugging) but run the final version using
<i>Pythonw.exe</i>.</p>




<H5>20.1.3.1
"Hello World"</H5>


<P>The easiest way to get a feel for Tkinter is with the ever popular
"Hello World!" example. The result of this little program
is shown in <A href="pythonwin32_snode159.html#8">Figure 20.1</A>.</p>



<PRe CLASS="monofont">
from sys import exit
from Tkinter import *
root = Tk() 
Button(root, text='Hello World!', command=exit).pack() 
root.mainloop()</Pre>


<ceNTER>

<img bORDEr="0" width="502" height="68" src="FILES/ppw.2001.gif" alt="figs/ppw.2001.gif"></cenTER>


<P>As you can see, apart from the <TT cLAsS="monofont">import</Tt> statements,
there are only three lines of interest. The <TT CLASs="monofont">root</tt>
variable is set to the default top-level window automatically created
by Tk, although applications with advanced requirements can customize
the top-level frames. The code then creates a Tkinter button object,
specifying the parent (the <tT CLAss="monofont">root</tt> variable), the
text for the button, and the command to execute when clicked. We
discuss the <TT CLass="monofont">pack()</tT> method later in this section.
Finally, turn control over to the main event-processing loop, which
creates the Windows on the screen and dispatches user-interface
events.</P>






<H5>20.1.3.2
The other end of the World</H5>


<p>From the extreme simplicity of the "Hello World" example,
the other end of the scale could be considered the
<tt class="monofont">tkDemo</tt> sample included with this chapter. Although
space considerations prevent us from examining this sample in detail,
<a href="pythonwin32_snode159.html#10">Figure 20.2</a> should give you an indication of the
capabilities offered by Tkinter.</p>

<p>Quite a few of these widgets are demonstrated in the tkBrowser
sample, and every one gets an exercise in the tkDemo sample, so you
are encouraged to experiment with these samples to get a feel for the
capabilities of each widget. Of these widgets, we will discuss two of
the most popular and powerful in more detail: the Text and Canvas
widgets.</P>



<P>The Text widget provides for the display and editing of text, as you
would expect from a text control. The Text widget is also capable of
supporting embedded images and child windows, but the real power of
the text control can be found in its support of
<I>indexes</I>, <I>tags</I>, and
<i>marks</i>:</p>



<a NAME="idx1933"></a><a naME="idx1934"></A><Dl>
<dt>
<i><FONT color="#990000">Indexes</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indexes provide a rich model for describing positions in the text
control. The position specification can be in terms of line and
column position (relative or absolute), pixel position, special
system index names, and so forth.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><FONT COlOR="#990000">Tags</fONt></I></DT>
<DD>
<P>
<a namE="idx1933"></A>Tags are an association
between a name and one or more regions of text. There is no
restriction on overlapping regions, so a character may belong to any
number of tags, and tags can be created and destroyed dynamically. In
addition, the text associated with a tag may be given any number of
display characteristics (such as font, color specifications, and so
forth). When we combine these capabilities with the Tkinter event
model described later, it becomes easy to build highly interactive
applications (such as a web browser) around this Text widget.</P>
</Dd>
<dt>
<i><FONT coloR="#990000">Marks</FONt></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a name="idx1934"></a>A mark is
a single position within the text (or more accurately, a position
between two characters). Marks flow naturally with the surrounding
text as characters are inserted and deleted, making them particularly
suitable for implementing concepts such as bookmarks or breakpoints.
Tkinter manages a number of predefined marks, such as
<tt class="monofont">insert</tT>, which defines the current insertion point.</P>
</DD>
</DL>


<p>The Canvas widget displays graphical items, such as lines, arcs,
bitmaps, images, ovals, polygons, rectangles, text strings, or
arbitrary Tkinter widgets. Like the Text widget, the Canvas widget
implements a powerful tagging system, allowing you to associate any
items on the canvas with a name.</P>






<H5>20.1.4.2
Dialog and other noncore widgets</h5>


<P>Many useful widgets are actually built from the core widgets. The
most common example is the dialog widget, and recent versions of
Tkinter provide some new sophisticated <A nAME="idx1935"></A>dialog widgets similar to the Windows
common dialogs. In many cases when running on Windows, the standard
Windows dialog is used.</P>



<P>Many of these dialogs come in their own module. <a href="pythonwin32_snode159.html#16">Table 20.2</A> lists the <A Name="idx1936"></a>common dialog box modules and their
functionality.</P>

<p>There are many other widgets available; both included with the
Tkinter package, and also available externally. One interesting and
popular source of Tkinter widgets can be found in the
<a naME="idx1937"></A>Python megawidgets
(<Tt class="monofont">Pmw</tt>) package. This package comes with excellent
documentation and sample code and can be found at
<a name="idx1938"></a><a target="_blank" HREF="http://http://../pmw.sourceforge.net/default.htm">http://pmw.sourceforge.net</A>.</P>



<p>In most cases, you build your own dialogs by deriving them from the
<TT cLAsS="monofont">tkSimpleDialog.Dialog</TT>
<A NAme="idx1939"></a>.
Our tkBrowser sample defines an <tT CLAss="monofont">EditTransaction</tt>
class that shows an example of this.</P>






<H5>20.1.4.3
Widget properties and methods</H5>


<P>
<a namE="idx1940"></A>Tkinter provides a flexible and
powerful attribute set for all widgets. Almost all attributes can be
set at either widget-creation time or once the widget has been
created and displayed. Although Tkinter provides obvious attributes
for items such as the color, font, or visible state of a widget, the
set of enhanced attributes for widgets is usually the key to tapping
the full potential of Tkinter.</P>



<P>Tkinter makes heavy use of Python keyword arguments when specifying
widget attributes. A widget of any type (for instance a Label) is
constructed with code similar to:</p>



<pre class="monofont">
w = Label(master, option1=value1, option2=value2,...)</pre>


<p>And once constructed, can be reconfigured at any time with code like:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">
w.configure(option1=value1, option2=value2, ...)</PRE>


<P>For a specific example, you can create a label with the following
code:</P>



<pRE cLAsS="monofont">label = Label(parent, background='white', 
                      text='Hello World!',
                      relief=RAISED, 
                      borderwidth=3)</PRE>


<P>And provide an annoying blinking effect by periodic execution of:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">label.configure(background='red')</pre>


<p>And:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">label.configure(background='white')</PRE>


<p>There are dozens of options that can be specified for each widget.
<a href="pythonwin32_snode159.html#18">Table 20.3</a> lists a few common properties available
for each widget.</p>

<p>The font that displays the text. This can be in a bewildering array
of formats: some platform-independent and some platform-dependent.
The most common form is a tuple containing font name, point size, and
style (for example, <tt CLASs="monofont">("Times",</tt>
<tt class="monofont">10,</tt> <tt class="monofont">"bold"</tt>). Tkinter guarantees
that the fonts <TT CLASs="monofont">Times,</TT>
<tT ClASS="monofont">Helvetica</TT>, and <Tt claSS="monofont">Courier</TT> exist on
all platforms, and styles can be any combination of bold, roman,
italic, underline, and overstrike, which are always available, with
Tkinter substituting the closest matching font if necessary.</p>

<P>Techniques used by control widgets to communicate back to the
application. The <tT CLASS="monofont">command</tt> option allows you to
specify an arbitrary Python function (or any callable Python object)
to be invoked when the specified action occurs (e.g., when a Button
widget is pushed). Alternatively, several widgets take the variable
option and, if specified, must be an instance of one of the
<tt CLASs="monofont">StringVar</tt>, <tT CLAss="monofont">IntVar</tt>,
<TT CLass="monofont">DoubleVar</tt>, or <tt class="monofont">BooleanVar</tt>
classes (or subclass). Once set up, changes to the widget are
immediately reflected in the object, and changes in the object are
immediately reflected to the widget. This is demonstrated in
<i>tkBrowser.py</i> in a number of places including the
<tt claSS="monofont">EditTransaction</TT> class, which uses this technique
for managing the data shown in the dialog.</P>

<p>There are also dozens of methods available for each widget class, and
the Tkinter documentation describes these in detail, but there is one
important method we mention here because it's central to the
Tkinter event model.</p>



<p>The <tT CLAss="monofont">bind()</tt>
<A NAMe="idx1941"></a> method is simple, but provides an
incredible amount of power by allowing you to bind a GUI event to a
Python function. It takes two parameters, the event you wish to bind
to (specified as a string) and a Python object to be called when the
event fires.</p>



<p>The power behind this method comes from the specification of the
event. Tkinter provides a rich set of events, ranging from keyboard
and mouse actions to Window focus or state changes. The specification
of the event is quite intuitive (for example, &lt;Key&gt; binds any
key, &lt;Ctrl-Alt-Key-Z&gt; is a very specific key, &lt;Button-1&gt;
is a the first mouse-button click, and so forth) and covers over 20
basic event types. You should consult the Tkinter reference guides
for a complete set of events supported by Windows and a full
description of the Tkinter event model.<a name="idx1942"></a></p>








<h4>20.1.5
Geometry Management</h4>


<p>Tkinter provides a powerful concept typically not found in Windows
GUI toolkits, and that is <a name="idx1943"></a>geometry management. Geometry
management is the technique used to lay out child
<a NAME="idx1944"></A>widgets
in their parent (for example, controls in a dialog box). Most
traditional Windows environments force you to specify the absolute
position of each control. Although this is specified in dialog units
rather than pixels and controls can be moved once created, Tkinter
provides a far more powerful and flexible model.</P>



<p>Tkinter widgets provide three methods for geometry management,
<TT cLAsS="monofont">pack()</TT>, <TT Class="monofont">grid()</TT>, or
<TT clasS="monofont">place()</TT>.</P>



<p><tt cLASS="monofont">place()</tt>
<a name="idx1945"></a> is the simplest mechanism and similar to
what most Windows users are used to; each widget has its position
explicitly specified, either in absolute or relative coordinates. The
<tt class="monofont">grid()</tt>
<a namE="idx1946"></A> mechanism, as you may expect,
automatically aligns the widgets in a grid pattern, while the
<TT CLaSS="monofont">pack()</tT>
<A nAME="idx1947"></A> method is the most powerful and the most
commonly used. When widgets are packed, they are automatically
positioned based on the size of the parent and the other widgets
already placed. All of these techniques allow customization of the
layout process, such as the padding between widgets.</P>



<P>These geometry-management capabilities allow you to define user
interfaces that aren't tied to particular screen resolutions
and can automatically resize and layout controls as the window size
changes, capabilities that most experienced Windows user-interface
programmers will know are otherwise difficult to achieve. Our two
samples (described next) both make extensive use of the
<tt clASS="monofont">pack()</Tt> method, while the tkDemo sample also makes
limited use of <tt cLASS="monofont">grid()</tt>.</p>







<h4>20.1.6
Tkinter Sample Code</H4>


<P>We have included a sample Doubletalk browser written in Tkinter. This
is a fully functional transaction viewer and editor application and
is implemented in <I>tkBrowser.py</I>. This implements
a number of features that demonstrate how to build powerful
applications in Tkinter. A number of dialogs are presented, including
the transaction list, and the detail for each specific transaction.
To show how simple basic drawing and charting is, a graphical view of
each account is also provided. Rather than labor over the details of
this sample, the best thing to do is just to run it. Then once you
have a feel for the functionality, peruse the source code to see the
implementation. There are ample comments and documentation strings
included less than 700 lines of source. <a href="pythonwin32_snode159.html#21">Figure 20.3</a>
shows our final application in action.</p>

<P>The second sample is <I>TkDemo.py</I>, which is a
demonstration of all the Tkinter core widgets. It is highly animated
and provides a good feel for the basic operation of these widgets.</p>



<p>As mentioned previously, Tkinter is the standard GUI for Python
applications, therefore you can find a large number of resources both
in the standard Python documentation and referenced via the Python
web site.</p>







<h4>20.1.7
Tkinter Conclusion</H4>


<P>Tkinter is excellent for small, quick GUI applications, and since it
runs on more platforms than any other Python GUI toolkit, it is a
good choice where portability is the prime concern.</P>



<P>Obviously we haven't been able to give Tkinter the depth of
discussion it warrants, but it's fair to say that almost
anything that can be done using the C language and Tk can be done
using Python and Tkinter. One example is the Python megawidgets
(<tt class="monofont">PMW</tt>) package mentioned previously; this is a pure
Python package that creates an excellent widget set by building on
the core Tkinter widgets.</p>
