<h3>20.2
PythonWin</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1952"></a> <a naME="idx1953"></A>As mentioned in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode35.html">Chapter 4</A>, PythonWin is a framework that exposes much of
the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) to Python. MFC is a C++
framework that provides an object-based model of the Windows GUI API,
as well as a number of services useful to applications.</P>



<P>The term <I>PythonWin</i> is a bit of a misnomer.
PythonWin is really an application written to make use of the
extensions that expose MFC to Python. This means PythonWin actually
consists of two components:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>Python modules that provide the raw MFC functionality</p>
</li>
<li><p>Python code that uses these modules to provide the PythonWin
application</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We focus primarily on the MFC functionality exposed to Python so we
can build a fully functional GUI application.</p>



<p>As PythonWin mirrors MFC, it's important to understand key MFC
concepts to understand how PythonWin hangs together. Although we
don't have room for a complete analysis of MFC, an introduction
to its concepts is in order.</P>




<H4>20.2.1
Introduction to MFC</H4>


<P>The <A NaME="idx1954"></a>Microsoft Foundation Classes are a
framework for developing complete applications in C++. MFC provides
two primary functions:</P>



<Ul>
<LI><P>An object-oriented wrapper for the native Windows user-interface API</P>
</LI>
<li><p>Framework facilities that remove much of the grunge work involved in
making a complete, standalone Windows application</p>
</LI>
</UL>
<p>The object-oriented wrapping is straightforward. Many Windows API
functions take a "handle" as their first parameter; for
example, the function <tt cLASS="monofont">SendMessage()</tt> takes a handle
to a window (an <tt CLASs="monofont">HWND</tt>),
<tt class="monofont">DrawText()</tt> takes a handle to a device context (an
<tt class="monofont">HDC</tt>) and so forth. MFC wraps most of these handles
in objects and thus provides <TT CLASs="monofont">CWnd</TT> and
<tT ClASS="monofont">CDC</TT> classes, both of which have the relevant
methods.</P>



<p>So, instead of writing your C++ code as:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">
HWND hwnd = CreateWindow(...); // Create a handle to the window...
EnableWindow(hwnd); // and enable it.</prE>


<P>You may write code similar to:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">CWnd wnd; // Create a window object.
    wnd.CreateWindow(...); // Create the Window.
    wnd.EnableWindow();// And enable it.</Pre>


<p>There are a large number of objects, including generic window
objects, frame windows, MDI child windows, property pages, fonts,
dialogs, etc. It's a large object model, so a good MFC text or
the MFC documentation is recommended for anything more than casual
use from Python.</p>



<p>The framework aspects of MFC provides some useful utility classes,
both for structuring your application and performing many of the
mundane tasks a good Windows application should do. The mundane but
useful tasks it performs include automatic creation of tool-tip text
and status-bar text for menus and dockable toolbars, reading and
writing preferences in the registry, maintaining the "recently
used files" list, and so forth.</p>



<p>MFC also provides a useful
<i>application/template/document/view</i> architecture.
You create an application object, then add one or more document
templates to the application. A document template knows how to create
a specific document, meaning your application can work with many
documents. A "document" is a general concept; it holds
the data for the object your application manages, but doesn't
provide any user interface for viewing that data. The last link in
the chain is the view object that's responsible for the user
interaction. Each view defines a way of looking at your data. For
example, you may have a graphical view and also a tabular view.
Included in all of this are many utility functions for managing these
objects. For example, when a view notifies its document that data has
been changed, the document automatically notifies all other views, so
they can be kept up-to-date.</p>



<p>If your application doesn't fit this model, don't be
alarmed: you can customize almost all this behavior. But there is no
doubt that utilizing this framework is the simplest way to use MFC.</p>







<h4>20.2.2
The PythonWin Object Model</h4>


<p>Think of <a name="idx1955"></a>PythonWin as composed of two distinct
portions. The <TT CLASs="monofont">win32ui</TT> module is a Python extension
that provides access to the raw MFC classes. For many MFC objects,
there is an equivalent <tT ClASS="monofont">win32ui</TT> object. For
example, the functionality of the MFC <Tt claSS="monofont">CWnd</TT> object
is provided by a <tt clASS="monofont">PyCWnd</Tt> Python object; an MFC
<tt cLASS="monofont">CDocument</tt> object by a
<tt class="monofont">PyCDocument</tt> object, etc. For a full list, see the
PythonWin reference (on the PythonWin help menu).</p>



<p>For the MFC framework to be useful, you need to be able to override
default methods in the MFC object hierarchy; for example, the method
<tt class="monofont">CView::OnDraw()</tT> is generally overridden to draw
the screen for a view. But the objects exposed by the
<TT CLAsS="monofont">win32ui</Tt> module are technically Python types (they
aren't classes) and a quirk in the Python language prevents
these Python types from having their methods overridden.</P>



<P>To this end, the <tT CLASS="monofont">win32ui</tt> module provides a
mechanism to "attach" a Python class instance object to a
<tt CLASs="monofont">win32ui</tt> type. When MFC needs to call an overridden
method, it then calls the method on the attached Python object.</p>



<P>What this means for the programmer is that you can use natural Python
classes to extend the types defined in <TT Class="monofont">win32ui</TT>.</P>



<P>The <tt class="monofont">pywin.mfc</tt> package provides Python base classes
that interface with many of the <tt class="monofont">win32ui</tt> objects.
These base classes handle the interaction with
<tt cLASS="monofont">win32ui</TT> and allow you to use Python subclassing to
get your desired behavior.</p>



<P>This means that when you use a PythonWin object, there are two Python
objects involved (the object of a <Tt CLaSS="monofont">win32ui</TT> type and
the Python class instance), plus an underlying MFC C++ object.</P>



<P>Let's see what this means in practice. We will examine a few of
these objects from the PythonWin interactive window and create a
dialog object using one of the standard PythonWin dialogs:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32ui
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pywin.mfc.dialog import Dialog
&gt;&gt;&gt; d=Dialog(win32ui.IDD_SIMPLE_INPUT)</pre>


<P>Looking at the object, you can see it's indeed an instance of a
Python class:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; d
&lt;pywin.mfc.dialog.Dialog instance at 1083c80&gt;</PRe>


<p>And you can see the underlying <tt class="monofont">win32ui</tt> object:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; d._obj_
object 'PyCDialog' - assoc is 010820C0, vf=True, notify=0,ch/u=0/0, mh=1, kh=0
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pRE>


<P>It says that the C++ object is at address 0x010820c0 and also some
other internal, cryptic properties of the object. You can use any of
the underlying <TT ClASs="monofont">win32ui</TT> methods automatically on
this object:</p>



<PRE CLAss="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; d.CreateWindow()
&gt;&gt;&gt; button=d.GetDlgItem(win32ui.IDC_PROMPT1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; button.SetWindowText("Hello from Python")
&gt;&gt;&gt;</prE>


<P>The prompt in the dialog should now read "Hello from
Python."</P>







<H4>20.2.3
Developing a PythonWin Sample Application</h4>


<p>
<a nAME="idx1956"></A>During the rest of this section, we
will develop a sample application using PythonWin. This will lead us
through many of the important MFC and PythonWin concepts, while also
leveraging the dynamic nature of PythonWin.</p>



<p>
<a nAME="idx1957"></A> <a name="idx1958"></a>MFC itself has a tutorial/sample
called Scribble, which delivers a basic drawing application. We will
develop a version of Scribble written in Python.</p>



<p>We will make use of some of the features of PythonWin to demonstrate
how rapidly you can create such an application. Specifically, we will
develop the Scribble framework first to run under the existing
PythonWin framework, then make changes to it so it can run
standalone. This is in contrast to the traditional technique of
developing MFC applications, where the application object is often
one of the first entities defined. A key benefit in using the
PythonWin application object is that you get the full benefits of the
PythonWin IDE, including error handling and reporting in the
interactive window. This makes development much easier before we
finally plug in our custom application object.</p>



<p>The general design of the Scribble application is simple. Define the
document object to keep a list of strokes. A
<i>stroke</i> is the start and end coordinates of a
line. The document object also can load and store this list of
strokes to a file. A view object is also defined that can render
these strokes onto a Window.</p>



<p>The first step in the sample is to provide a placeholder for the
document template, document, and view objects. Once this skeleton is
working, we fill out these objects with a useful implementation.</p>







<h4>20.2.4
Defining a Simple Framework</h4>


<p>
<a naME="idx1959"></A>Our first step is to develop a
simple framework with placeholders for the major objects.</P>



<P>We define three objects: a<A nAMe="idx1960"></A> <A nAME="idx1961"></A> <A Name="idx1962"></a> <TT CLass="monofont">ScribbleTemplate</tT>, a
<TT Class="monofont">ScribbleDocument</TT>, and a
<TT class="monofont">ScribbleView</tt>. These objects derive their
implementation from objects in the
<tt class="monofont">pywin.mfc.docview</tt>
<a name="idx1963"></A> module. The
<TT CLAsS="monofont">ScribbleTemplate</Tt> object remains empty in this
implementation. The <TT cLASS="monofont">ScribbleDocument</TT> object has a
single method,
<tt clASS="monofont">OnNew-Document()</Tt>
<a naME="idx1964"></A>, which is called as a document object is
initialized; the implementation defines an empty list of strokes. The
view object is based on a
<Tt claSS="monofont">PyCScrollView</TT>
<a name="idx1965"></a>
(i.e., an <a name="idx1966"></a>MFC
<tt class="monofont">CScrollView</tt>) and defines a single method
<TT CLASs="monofont">OnInitialUpdate()</TT>
<a NAmE="idx1967"></A>. As the name implies, this method is
called the first time a view object is updated. This method places
the view in the correct mapping mode and disables the scrollbars. For
more information on mapping modes and views, see the MFC
documentation.</P>



<P>The final part of the skeleton registers the new document template
with the MFC framework. This registration process is simple, just a
matter of calling <TT clasS="monofont">AddDocTemplate()</TT> on the
application object. In addition, this code associates some
<A name="idx1968"></A>doc strings with
the template. These doc strings tell the MFC framework important
details about the document template, such as the file extensions for
the documents, the window title for new documents, etc. For
information on these doc strings, see the PythonWin Reference for the
function <TT Class="monofont">PyCDocTemplate.SetDocStrings()</TT>.</P>

<td valign="top">
<p>The term <i>doc strings</i> has a number of meanings.
To Python, a doc string is a special string in a Python source file
that provides documentation at runtime for specific objects. In the
context of an MFC document template, a doc string is a string that
describes an MFC document object.</p>


</td>
</tr></TABLE></Td></TR></tABlE></P>

<P>A final note before we look at the code. This application has no
special requirement for a frame window. The standard MFC/PythonWin
Frame windows are perfectly suitable for the application. Therefore,
we don't define a specific Frame window for the sample.</P>



<P>
<A name="idx1969"></A>Let's look at the example
application with the described functionality:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont"># scribble1.py
#
# The starting framework for our scribble application.
import win32ui
import win32con
import pywin.mfc.docview

class ScribbleTemplate(pywin.mfc.docview.DocTemplate):
    pass

class ScribbleDocument(pywin.mfc.docview.Document):
    def OnNewDocument(self):
        """Called whenever the document needs initializing.
        For most MDI applications, this is only called as the document
        is created.
        """
        self.strokes = []
        return 1

class ScribbleView(pywin.mfc.docview.ScrollView):
    def OnInitialUpdate(self):
        self.SetScrollSizes(win32con.MM_TEXT, (0, 0))

# Now we do the work to create the document template, and
# register it with the framework.

# For debugging purposes, we first attempt to remove the old template.
# This is not necessary once our app becomes stable!
try:
    win32ui.GetApp().RemoveDocTemplate(template)
except NameError:
    # haven't run this before - that's ok
    pass

# Now create the template object itself...
template = ScribbleTemplate(None, ScribbleDocument, None, ScribbleView)
# Set the doc strings for the template.
docs='\nPyScribble\nPython Scribble Document\nScribble documents (*.psd)\n.psd'
template.SetDocStrings(docs)

# Then register it with MFC.
win32ui.GetApp().AddDocTemplate(template)</PRe>


<p>Notice there's some code specifically for debugging. If you
execute this module multiple times, you'd potentially create
multiple document templates, but all for the same class of documents
(i.e., the <tt CLASs="monofont">ScribbleDocument</tt>). To this end, each
time you execute this module, try to remove the document template
added during the previous execution.</p>



<p>What does this sample code do? It has registered the
<tt class="monofont">ScribbleTemplate</tt> with MFC, and MFC is now capable
of creating a new document. Let's see this in action. To
register the template in
<a name="idx1970"></a>PythonWin, perform the following
steps:</p>



<UL>
<LI><P>Start PythonWin.</P>
</lI>
<Li><P>Open the sample code in PythonWin using the File menu and select Open.</P>
</lI>
<LI><P>From the File menu, select Import. This action executes the module in
the PythonWin environment.</P>
</Li>
</ul>
<p>To test this skeleton, select New from the File menu. You will see a
list of all the document templates registered in PythonWin. The list
should look something like <A href="pythonwin32_snode160.html#8">Figure 20.4</a>.</p>



<cENTEr>
<h5>
<a nAME="8"></A>Figure 20.4. The File/New dialog in PythonWin after executing the sample application</h5>

<img border="0" width="502" height="131" src="FILES/ppw.2004.gif" ALT="figs/ppw.2004.gif"></cENtER>


<p>You can now select the Python <TT CLASs="monofont">ScribbleDocument</tt> and
see what happens. You should see a new Frame window, with the title
<tT CLAss="monofont">PyScribble1</tt>. MFC has given the new document a
default name based on the doc strings you supplied the template.</P>



<P>Because you haven't added any code for interacting with the
user, your application won't actually do anything yet! We will
now develop this skeleton into a usable Scribble application.</P>







<H4>20.2.5
Enhancing the DocumentTemplate</h4>


<p>Although MFC and PythonWin support multiple document templates,
there's a slight complication that isn't immediately
obvious. When MFC is asked to open a document file, it asks each
registered <tt CLASs="monofont">DocumentTemplate</tt> in turn if it can
handle this document type. The default implementation for
<tt class="monofont">DocumentTemplates</tt> is to report that it "can
possibly open this document." Thus, when you're asked to
open a Scribble document, one of the other
<tt class="monofont">DocumentTemplate</tt>
<A NAME="idx1971"></A>
<a NAmE="idx1972"></A>
objects (e.g., the Python editor template) may be asked to handle it,
rather than your <tT CLASS="monofont">ScribbleTemplate</tt>. This
wouldn't be a problem if this application handled only one
document template, but since PythonWin already has some of its own,
it could be a problem.</p>



<p>Therefore, it's necessary to modify the
<TT CLass="monofont">DocumentTemplate</tT> so that when asked, it answers
"I can definitely open this document." MFC then directs
the open request to the template.</P>



<P>You provide this functionality by overriding the MFC method
<Tt claSS="monofont">MatchDocType()</TT>
<a name="idx1973"></a>. It's necessary for this function
to first check if a document of that name is already open; this
prevents users from opening the document multiple times. The document
template code now looks like:</p>



<pre class="monofont">class ScribbleTemplate(pywin.mfc.docview.DocTemplate):
    def MatchDocType(self, fileName, fileType):
        doc = self.FindOpenDocument(fileName)
        if doc: return doc
        ext = string.lower(os.path.splitext(fileName)[1])
        if ext =='.psd':
            return win32ui.CDocTemplate_Confidence_yesAttemptNative
        return win32ui.CDocTemplate_Confidence_noAttempt</pre>


<p>As you can see, you check the extension of the filename, and if it
matches, tell MFC that the document is indeed yours. If the extension
doesn't match, tell MFC you can't open the file.</p>







<h4>20.2.6
Enhancing the Document</H4>


<P>
<A NAMe="idx1974"></A>
<A nAMe="idx1975"></A>As
mentioned previously, this <TT CLAss="monofont">ScribbleDocument</tt> object
is responsible only for working with the document data, not for
interacting with the user. This makes the
<TT CLass="monofont">ScribbleDocument</tT> quite simple. The first step is
to add some public methods for working with the strokes. These
functions look like:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">class ScribbleDocument(pywin.mfc.docview.Document):
...
    def AddStroke(self, start, end, fromView):
        self.strokes.append((start, end))
        self.SetModifiedFlag()
        self.UpdateAllViews( fromView, None )
        
    def GetStrokes(self):
        return self.strokes</PRe>


<p>The first function appends the new stroke to the list of strokes. It
also sets the document's "modified flag." This flag
is used by MFC to automatically prompt the user to save the document
as the program exits. It also automatically enables the File/Save
option for the document.</p>



<p>The last thing the document must do is to load and save the data from
a file. MFC itself handles displaying of the Save As, etc., dialogs,
and calls Document functions to perform the actual save. The function
names are
<tt class="monofont">OnOpenDocument()</tt>
<a name="idx1976"></a> and
<tt CLASS="monofont">OnSaveDocument()</Tt>
<A NaME="idx1977"></a> respectively.</P>



<P>As the strokes are a simple list, you can use the Python
<TT CLass="monofont">pickle</tT> module. The functions become quite easy:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">def OnOpenDocument(self, filename):
        file = open(filename, "rb")
        self.strokes = pickle.load(file)
        file.close()
        win32ui.AddToRecentFileList(filename)
        return 1
        
    def OnSaveDocument(self, filename):
        file = open(filename, "wb")
        pickle.dump(self.strokes, file)
        file.close()
        self.SetModifiedFlag(0)
        win32ui.AddToRecentFileList(filename)
        return 1</PRe>


<p><tt CLASs="monofont">OnOpenDocument()</tt> loads the strokes from the named
file. In addition, it places the filename to the most recently used
(MRU) list. <tt class="monofont">OnSaveDocument()</tt> dumps the strokes to
the named file, updates the document status to indicate it's no
longer modified, and adds the file to the MRU list. And that is all
you need to make your document fully functional.</p>







<h4>20.2.7
Defining the View</h4>


<p>The <tt claSS="monofont">View</TT>
<A NaME="idx1978"></a> <A NaME="idx1979"></A> object is the most complex object in
the sample. The <TT Class="monofont">View</TT> is responsible for all
interactions with the user, which means the <TT clasS="monofont">View</TT>
must collect the strokes as the user draws them, and also draw the
entire list of strokes whenever the window requires repainting.</P>



<p>The collection of the strokes is the most complex part. To collect
effectively, you must trap the user pressing the mouse button in the
window. Once this occurs, enter a drawing mode, and as the mouse is
moved, draw a line to the current position. When the user releases
the mouse button, they have completed the stroke, so add the stroke
to the document. The key steps to coax this behavior are:</p>



<ul>
<LI><P>The <Tt class="monofont">View</tt> must hook the relevant mouse messages: in
this case, the <tt class="monofont">LBUTTONDOWN</tt>,
<tt clASS="monofont">LBUTTONUP</TT>, and <Tt CLaSS="monofont">MOUSEMOVE</tT>
messages.</P>
</LI>
<LI><p>When a <tt cLASS="monofont">LBUTTONDOWN</tt> message is received, remember
the start position and enter a drawing mode. Also capture the mouse,
to ensure that you get all future mouse messages, even when the mouse
leaves the window.</p>
</lI>
<LI><P>If a <tt clASS="monofont">MOUSEMOVE</Tt> message occurs when you are in
drawing mode, draw a line from the remembered start position to the
current mouse position. In addition, erase the previous line drawn by
this process. This gives a "rubber band" effect as you
move the mouse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a <tt class="monofont">LBUTTONUP</tt> message is received, notify the
document of the new, completed stroke, release the mouse capture, and
leave drawing mode.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<P>After adding this logic to the sample, it now looks like:</P>



<PRE ClASs="monofont">class ScribbleView(pywin.mfc.docview.ScrollView):
    def OnInitialUpdate(self):
        self.SetScrollSizes(win32con.MM_TEXT, (0, 0))
        self.HookMessage(self.OnLButtonDown,win32con.WM_LBUTTONDOWN)
        self.HookMessage(self.OnLButtonUp,win32con.WM_LBUTTONUP)
        self.HookMessage(self.OnMouseMove,win32con.WM_MOUSEMOVE)
        self.bDrawing = 0

        assert not self.bDrawing, "Button down message while still drawing"
        startPos = params[5]
        # Convert the startpos to Client coordinates.
        self.startPos = self.ScreenToClient(startPos)
        self.lastPos = self.startPos
        # Capture all future mouse movement.
        self.SetCapture()
        self.bDrawing = 1
        
    def OnLButtonUp(self, params):
        assert self.bDrawing, "Button up message, but not drawing!"
        endPos = params[5]
        endPos = self.ScreenToClient(endPos)
        self.ReleaseCapture()
        self.bDrawing = 0
        # And add the stroke to the document.
        self.GetDocument().AddStroke( self.startPos, endPos, self )

        dc.MoveTo(self.startPos)
        dc.LineTo(self.lastPos)

        # Now draw the new position
        self.lastPos = self.ScreenToClient(pos)
        dc.MoveTo(self.startPos)
        dc.LineTo(self.lastPos)</PRe>


<P>Most of this code should be quite obvious. It's worth
mentioning that you tell Windows to draw the line using a
<TT CLAss="monofont">NOT</tt> mode. This mode is handy; if you draw the same
line twice, the second draw erases the first. Thus, to erase a line
you drew previously, all you need is to draw the same line again.</P>



<P>Another key point is that the mouse messages all report the position
in "Screen Coordinates" (i.e., relative to the top-left
corner of the screen) rather than in "Client Coordinates"
(i.e., relative to the top-left corner of our window). You use a
member function <TT clasS="monofont">PyCWnd.ScreenToClient()</TT> to
transform these coordinates.</P>



<p>The final step to complete the <tt cLASS="monofont">View</tt> is to draw all
your strokes whenever the window requires updating. This code is
simple: you iterate over the list of strokes for the document,
drawing lines between the coordinates. To obtain this behavior, use
the code:</p>



<pre class="monofont">def OnDraw(self, dc):
        # All we need to is get the strokes, and paint them.
        doc = self.GetDocument()
        for startPos, endPos in doc.GetStrokes():
            dc.MoveTo(startPos)
            dc.LineTo(endPos)</pre>


<p>And that's it! You now have a fully functional drawing
application, capable of loading and saving itself from
disk.<tt clasS="monofont"></TT>

<H4>20.2.8
Creating the Application Object</H4>


<P>
<a namE="idx1982"></A>The simplest way to create an
application object for Scribble is to subclass one of the standard
application objects. The PythonWin application object is implemented
in
<TT clasS="monofont">pywin.framework.intpyapp</TT>
<A name="idx1983"></A>,
and it derives from the
<TT Class="monofont">CApp</tt>
<a name="idx1984"></a> class in
<tt class="monofont">pywin.framework.app</tt>. This base class provides much
of the functionality for an application, so we too will derive our
application from <TT CLASs="monofont">CApp</TT>.</p>



<P>This makes the application object small and simple. You obviously may
need to enhance certain aspects; in this case, you should use the
<Tt CLASS="monofont">pywin.framework</Tt> modules as a guide. The minimal
application object looks like:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont"># scribbleApp.py
#
# The application object for Python.
from pywin.framework.app import CApp

class ScribbleApplication(CApp):
    def InitInstance(self):
        # All we need do is call the base class,
        # then import our document template.
        CApp.InitInstance(self)
        import scribble2

# And create our application object.
ScribbleApplication()</prE>


<P>To run this, use the following command line:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt; start pythonwin /app scribbleApp.py</Pre>


<p>An instance of <i>Pythonwin.exe</i> now starts, but
uses the application object you defined. Therefore, there'a no
Interactive Window, the application doesn't offer to open
<i>.py</i> files, etc. The Scribble application should
look like <a href="pythonwin32_snode160.html#16">Figure 20.5</a>.</p>

<P>There is also a technique to avoid this command line, but you need a
copy of a resource editor (such as Microsoft Visual C++). You can
take a copy of <I>Pythonwin.exe</I> (name it something
suitable for your application), then open the
<I>.exe</i> in the resource editor and locate an entry
in the string table with the value
<tt class="monofont">pywin.framework.startup</tt>. This is the name of a
module executed to boot the PythonWin application; the default script
parses the "/app" off the command line and loads that
application. You can change this to any value you like, and PythonWin
then loads your startup script. See <i>startup.py</i>
in the PythonWin distribution for an example of a startup
script.<a name="idx1985"></a></p>







<h4>20.2.9
PythonWin and Resources</h4>


<P>
<A NAME="idx1986"></a>As we've discussed, MFC provides a
framework architecture, and much of this architecture is tied
together by resource IDs, integers that identify Windows resources in
a DLL or executable.</P>



<P>For example, when you define a <tT ClASS="monofont">DocumentTemplate</TT>,
you specify a resource ID. The previous example doesn't specify
a resource ID, so the default of
<Tt claSS="monofont">win32ui.IDR_PYTHONTYPE</TT> is used. When a document is
created, MFC uses the resource ID in the following ways:</p>



<ul>
<lI><P>The menu with the ID is loaded and used for the document's
frame. This allows each document supported in an application to have
a unique set of menus as is common in MDI applications.</P>
</Li>
<li><p>The icon with the ID is loaded and used for the document's
frame.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>The accelerator with that ID is loaded, providing document-specific
shortcut keys to many of the menu functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example of the reliance on resource IDs is in the processing
and definition of menu and toolbar items. Each command in the
application is assigned an ID. When you define menu or toolbar items,
you specify the menu text (or toolbar bitmap) and the command ID.
When MFC displays a menu item, it uses a string defined with the same
ID and places this text automatically in the application's
status bar. When the mouse hovers over a toolbar item, MFC again
looks for a string with the specified ID and uses it for the
tooltip-text for the button. This architecture has a number of
advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>Hooking the various pieces of your application together becomes
simple. You define an icon, menu, accelerators, strings, and so forth
with the same resource ID, and MFC automatically ties all these
together for your application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are working with an existing MFC or C++ application,
there's a good chance you already use resources in a similar
fashion, so PythonWin often fits naturally when embedded in these
applications.</p>
</LI>
<LI><P>When you need to respond to a GUI command, specify the command ID.
The same code then handles the command regardless of whether it was
sourced from the keyboard, toolbar or menu.</P>
</lI>
<Li><P>Localizing your application for other languages becomes simpler. You
define new resources in the new language but use the same IDs, and
the application still works regardless of the particular resources in
use at the time.</P>
</lI>
</UL>
<P>However, it also has a number of disadvantages:</P>



<Ul>
<li><p>Python doesn't have a technique for defining resources, such as
dialogs, menus, toolbars, or strings. So while this scheme works well
using MFC from Microsoft Visual C++ (which does provide this
facility), it doesn't work as well from Python.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>It's a pain to move beyond the MFC-provided framework. As soon
as you begin manually defining and managing these resources, you
aren't much better off than if you simply had used the raw
Windows GUI API.</p>
</lI>
</UL>
<P>PythonWin can use resources from arbitrary DLLs, thus you can define
your own DLL containing only resources. PythonWin makes it easy to
use these resources; just load the DLL (using
<tt clASS="monofont">win32ui.LoadLibrary()</Tt>), and PythonWin locates and
uses the resources in this DLL.</p>



<p>If you are writing a large application, you'll probably find it
worthwhile to define your own resource DLL when using PythonWin. The
benefits offered by the framework make it worth the pain of initially
setting everything up. On the other hand, it does make PythonWin
somewhat cumbersome for defining these applications purely from
Python code.</p>







<h4>20.2.10
PythonWin Conclusion</h4>


<p>For the vast majority of Python users in Windows, PythonWin will
never be more than an interesting IDE environment for developing
Python applications. But many other Windows developers are beginning
to use PythonWin to develop Windows applications. When comparing the
three GUI toolkits available in this book, you will probably come to
the conclusion that PythonWin is the least suitable for simple, small
GUI applications written in Python, and this would be fair. However,
depending on your particular circumstances (usually either because
you have an existing MFC investment or it's important to use
some user-interface features offered only by PythonWin), it may be a
good choice.</p>



<p>PythonWin suffers from a lack of decent documentation. A Windows help
file is included that contains a reference guide for all of the
objects and methods exposed by PythonWin, but PythonWin doesn't
include a comprehensive overview of the MFC framework. There are many
good MFC books available, so a specific recommendation is impossible.
