<h3>21.2
Python and Popular Microsoft Applications</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx2044"></a>The
most popular and visible Active Scripting applications come from
Microsoft; This isn't surprising, since Microsoft developed the
Active Scripting implementation.</p>



<p>Here we discuss Internet Explorer, Internet Information Server, and
the Windows Scripting Host (WSH). Of these, IE is probably the most
fun to play with, but has the least practical use. Using Active
Scripting implies that the particular language is installed along
with the browser, and for the vast majority of Internet Explorer
users, this will not be true of Python. IIS and WSH are more
practical, as they usually run on a machine over which you have more
control; for example, it's often not a problem to install
Python on the same machine that runs IIS. Similarly, WSH is often
used for Windows NT administration, so installing Python on the
servers you are administering also shouldn't present a problem.</p>




<H4>21.2.1
Internet Explorer</H4>


<P>
<A name="idx2045"></A> <A NAme="idx2046"></a>Internet Explorer, Version 4 and above,
supports Active Scripting by embedding script code inside the HTML.
As the HTML is parsed and rendered by IE, the code is detected, the
particular language loaded, and the code executed. The script code is
embedded in the HTML inside blocks delimited by
<tt class="monofont">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> and
<tt class="monofont">&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</tt> tags. The following is an example
script that displays a message box:</P>



<PRE CLaSS="monofont">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
alert("Hello there")
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</pRE>


<p>The default language for IE is <A NAME="idx2047"></A>
<a namE="idx2048"></A>VBScript,
so this code is executed using VBScript. Because the script is so
simple, the only change needed to make it use Python is to specify
the language, as shown:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">&lt;SCRIPT Language=Python&gt;
alert("Hello there")
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</Pre>


<p>If you wish to experiment, you can save these three lines as a HTML
file and open it in Internet Explorer. You should see a message box,
followed by a blank web page.</p>



<P>You may be wondering where the
<TT Class="monofont">alert()</tt>
<a name="idx2049"></a> function came from, since it's
not a standard Python built-in function. This is the key to how
Active Scripting works. As the application (in this case IE) loads
the particular language, it notifies the language of global functions
and objects the language should make available;
<tt class="monofont">alert()</tt> is one of the functions made available by
Internet Explorer. This is how the application exposes its object
model to the language; the programmer uses these functions and
objects to manipulate the application.</P>



<P>The object model exposed by Internet Explorer is similar to the
Dynamic HTML object model. There is a window object, a document
object, and so forth, all of which allow you to get information from
the browser (for example, the current URL) or to direct the browser
to perform some action (for example, open a new URL or reposition the
window).</P>



<P>As mentioned previously, the fact that Python must be installed on
each client PC is likely to be a barrier to using Python in the IE
environment. It may be tempting to believe you could use Python to
overcome some limitations in VBScript or JScript: for example, access
the registry, open files, or create socket connections.
Unfortunately, Python also restricts the capabilities available to
the programmer when used with Internet Explorer. The whole concept of
client-side
<A NaME="idx2050"></a>scripting is dangerous, as you are
downloading arbitrary code from a web page and running it on your
computer. To avoid the potential problems with people writing
malicious code, IE explicitly tells Python that it should operate in
an untrusted mode, and Python complies by seriously restricting the
operations the script can perform. For example, when running in
Internet Explorer, it's impossible to import Python extension
modules (such as <TT cLASS="monofont">win32api</TT>), open local files,
create sockets, and so forth.</p>



<p>For this reason, we won't spend any time discussing the object
model for Internet Explorer. Instead, we present a few examples and
discuss the differences between VBScript and Python.</p>



<p>The following code presents an HTML file containing a form with one
edit control and three buttons. A VBScript handler is added for one
of the buttons and Python handlers to the remaining two. All the
buttons perform the same operation: update one of the text controls
with the current URL.</P>



<P>To keep the size of the example down, we avoided all HTML elements
not absolutely necessary to demonstrate the scripts. For your own
HTML, you should make all efforts to ensure your files conform to
valid HTML (e.g., are enclosed in <TT clasS="monofont">&lt;HTML&gt;</TT> and
<Tt claSS="monofont">&lt;BODY&gt;</TT> tags):</p>



<pre class="monofont">&lt;FORM NAME="TestForm" &gt;
   &lt;!-- A single text control all the buttons will use --&gt;
   &lt;INPUT TYPE="Text" 
          NAME="txtControl"
   &gt;
   &lt;!-- VBScript using inline event handling --&gt;
   &lt;INPUT NAME="butVB" 
          TYPE="Button" 
          VALUE="VB Script"
          OnClick="txtControl.value=document.location"
   &gt;
   &lt;!-- Python using inline event handling --&gt;
   &lt;INPUT NAME="butPy1"
          TYPE="Button"
          VALUE="Python inline"
          OnClick="TestForm.txtControl.value=document.location"
          LANGUAGE=Python
   &gt;
   &lt;!-- Python using an implicit event handler --&gt;
   &lt;INPUT NAME="butPy2"
          TYPE="Button"
          VALUE="Python implicit"
   &gt;
   &lt;!-- Now the code for the implicit handler --&gt;
   &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=Python&gt;
# Note we can not indent this block,
# as the leading whitespace will upset Python
def butPy2_onClick():
  TestForm.txtControl.value=document.location
   &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;</pre>


<p>This code demonstrates a few key points relating to the Python
implementation of Active Scripting. If you examine the VBScript
handler for the first button, notice that it can refer to the
<tt class="monofont">txtControl</tT> object without any special prefixes or
annotations; because both the script and the control are part of the
same form, a concept similar to scoping is applied. Python
doesn't support this degree of scoping, so the Python handlers
all must name each object explicitly.</P>



<P>Another important point is that in all Active Scripting applications,
you must be careful regarding whitespace. Although HTML is generally
insensitive to whitespace, any Python code embedded still is.</P>



<P>The event handling in Python attempts to conform to the conventions
VBScript and JScript programmers would be familiar with. Event
handling can be inline, where the script code is specified directly
in the definition of the object as we demonstrated in the previous
example. Alternatively, you can write a function with the name
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">object_event()</tT>, where <TT CLAss="monofont">object</tt> is
the name of the object, and <TT CLass="monofont">event</tT> is the name of
an event this object fires. Nothing is needed to explicitly attach
the event to this function: the name of the function is all that is
needed to get this behavior. This is demonstrated using
<TT Class="monofont">PyBut2_onClick()</TT>, which responds to the
<TT class="monofont">onClick</tt> event for the <tt class="monofont">PyBut2</tt>
object.</p>



<p>For more examples using Python within Internet Explorer, please see
the Active Scripting samples, available from the PythonCOM
<i>README</i>, installed with the Python for Windows
extensions. For more information on the Internet Explorer object
model, please see <a TARGET="_blank" hREf="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/</A>.<A nAME="idx2051"></A> <A Name="idx2052"></a></P>







<H4>21.2.2
Internet Information Server</H4>


<P>
<a namE="idx2053"></A> <A Name="idx2054"></a> <A NAMe="idx2055"></a>The Microsoft
Internet Information Server is a web server that supports the
standard Unix web-server scripting technique called the
<a name="idx2056"></a> <a name="idx2057"></a>Common Gateway Interface (CGI). In
addition to CGI, IIS also supports <a name="idx2058"></a> <a NAME="idx2059"></A>Active Server Pages (ASP),
which use Active Scripting to implement a richer scripting model than
offered by CGI.</P>



<p>Active Server Pages uses a scheme to embed the script code that is
similar to Internet Explorer. Code is still delimited with
<TT cLAsS="monofont">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</TT> tags, but the tag has a
<TT Class="monofont">RunAt=Server</TT> attribute added. For example:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">&lt;SCRIPT RunAt=Server Language=Python&gt;
# This code will run at the server
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
&lt;SCRIPT Language=Python&gt;
# This code will run at the client
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</Pre>


<p>Although this sounds simple, the complication again is that the
object model exposed by ASP is quite different to that exposed by IE.
If you attempt to call the
<tT CLAss="monofont">alert()</tt>
<a name="idx2060"></a> function, your code fails as
<tt class="monofont">alert()</tt> doesn't exist in the ASP object
model.</p>



<p>In addition to using <TT CLASs="monofont">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</TT> tags, ASP
allows alternative forms delimited by <tT ClASS="monofont">&lt;% %&gt;</TT>
and <Tt claSS="monofont">&lt;%= %&gt;</TT> tags. Script code delimited by
<tt clASS="monofont">&lt;%</Tt> and <tt cLASS="monofont">%&gt;</tt> tags are almost
identical to those delimited by <tt class="monofont">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt>
tags. The <tt class="monofont">&lt;%= %&gt;</tt> tag allows you to specify
arbitrary Python expressions, and the result of the expression is
replaced in the output. For example, if ASP encounters HTML of the
form:</p>



<PRE CLAsS="monofont">Hello &lt;%= name %&gt;</PrE>


<P>The value of the <tT CLASS="monofont">name</tt> variable is printed in the
output sent to the client.</p>



<p>The source files for Active Server Pages are stored as
<I>.asp</I>
<A Name="idx2061"></a> files,
although for all intents and purposes they are HTML files. The
<I>.asp</I> extension allows IIS to determine if the
page could potentially contain scripting code and hence should be
executed under the control of ASP.</P>



<P>ASP also allows Python to run completely unrestricted. There are no
limitations on the files that can be opened or the operations that
can be performed. As the script code is maintained on the server,
it's assumed the scripts are trusted. For a final feature that
makes Python and ASP a great match, you can specify the default
language for an ASP script. If an ASP page begins with the code
<tt clASS="monofont">&lt;%@ LANGUAGE=Python</Tt> <tt class="monofont">%&gt;</tt>,
Python is used as the default language for all
<tt class="monofont">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt>, <tt CLASS="monofont">&lt;%</Tt>, and
<TT cLAsS="monofont">&lt;%=</TT> tags.</P>



<P>ASP exposes seven key objects, as detailed in <A href="pythonwin32_snode165.html#9">Table 21.1</A>. For details on the attributes and methods
available on these objects, refer to the ASP documentation.</P>

<P>The following example uses the <TT CLAsS="monofont">Server</Tt>,
<TT cLASS="monofont">Reponse</TT>, and <tt clASS="monofont">Request</Tt> objects.
It's simple and again skips the <tt cLASS="monofont">&lt;HTML&gt;</tt>
and other tags your file normally has. It begins by nominating Python
as the default language for the page. This means all other code in
the file uses Python without explicitly specifying it for each script
block. The first script block uses the <tt CLASs="monofont">Request</tt>
object to look up the URL of the current page and save it to a local
variable. You then use <tt class="monofont">&lt;%=</tt> tags to print the
variable value and call the <tt class="monofont">Server.MapPath()</tt>
method to translate this to a local filesystem reference. The final
script block loops over all variables in the
<TT CLASs="monofont">Request.Server-Variables</TT> collection, printing the
variable name and value using the
<tT ClASS="monofont">Response.Write()</TT>
<A name="idx2062"></A> method:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">&lt;!--
ServerSample.asp - an example of Python
and Active Scripting
--&gt;

&lt;%@ Language=Python %&gt;

&lt;%
# Save the URL into a local variable
url = Request.ServerVariables("PATH_INFO")
%&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;Current Document&lt;/H2&gt;
The URL to this file is &lt;pre&gt;&lt;%= url %&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The local path to this URL is &lt;pre&gt;&lt;%= Server.mappath(url) %&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;Client Request Headers&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;% 
for key in Request.ServerVariables:
    Response.Write("%s=%s&lt;br&gt;" % (key, Request.ServerVariables(key)))
%&gt;</PRe>


<p>The <tt CLASs="monofont">Response.Write()</tt> method sends output to the
client. The string can contain any valid HTML, including tags.
It's worth noting that the Python <tt class="monofont">print</tt>
statement is never redirected by the scripting engine. For example,
it could be argued that when used with ASP, the
<tt class="monofont">print</tt> statement should send the output to the
<TT CLASs="monofont">Response.Write()</TT> method, but this doesn't
happen.</p>



<P>We are now ready to run the script, but how do we do this? At this
point, we better take a slight diversion into how you configure IIS
to run scripts.</P>







<h4>21.2.3
Configuring IIS</H4>


<P>
<A NAMe="idx2063"></a>The
process of configuring IIS is simple. Before you do anything, you
must ensure that Python is installed on the IIS server, and the
Active Scripting engine is registered, as we discuss previously in
this chapter. There is nothing Python-specific that needs to be
configured within IIS; all you need to do is tell IIS where to find
your scripts. Do this with the following process:</p>



<oL TYPe="1">
<li><p>Start the Internet Service Manager on the machine where IIS is
installed.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>Locate and select the default web server entry under your ASP server.</p>
</lI>
<LI><P>Select Action <img border="0" align="absmiddle" width="20" heIGHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" ALt="figs/U2192.gif"> New <IMg BORDER="0" aligN="absmiddle" WIDth="20" heIGHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" aLT="figs/U2192.gif"> Virtual Directory. The New Virtual
Directory Wizard begins.</P>
</Li>
<li><p>Enter <i>PythonTest</i> as the alias that accesses the
virtual directory and select Next.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are then prompted to enter the physical path of the directory
containing the content. Enter the name of the directory where your
test or sample <i>.asp</i> files are located and select
Next.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are then prompted for the permissions for the new directory. The
default options are acceptable, so you can select Finish.</p>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>The ISM should then look something like <A href="pythonwin32_snode165.html#12">Figure 21.1</A>.</P>



<cENTER>
<H5>
<a namE="12"></A>Figure 21.1. Internet Service Manager after creating the new directory</H5>

<Img boRDER="0" widtH="502" HEIght="339" src="FILES/ppw.2101.gif" alt="figs/ppw.2101.gif"></center>


<p>Let's now execute the sample script. The simplest thing is to
test your script by running Internet Explorer on the same machine as
the server. If you enter a URL, <a targET="_blank" HREF="http://../localhost/PythonTest/ServerSample.asp">http://localhost/PythonTest/ServerSample.asp</a>,
it executes the <I>ServerSample.asp</I> file from the
physical path you specified for the <i>PythonTest</I>
virtual directory.</P>



<p>Once this is done, the Explorer window should look<A NAME="idx2064"></A> <a namE="idx2065"></A> <A Name="idx2066"></a> like <A href="pythonwin32_snode165.html#13">Figure 21.2</a>.</p>

<h4>21.2.4
Windows Scripting Host</h4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx2067"></a> <a nAME="idx2068"></A>Another handy Active Scripting tool is the
Windows Scripting Host (WSH). WSH exposes an object model that makes
it particularly suitable for tasks that are normally attempted with
Windows batch files. WSH is often used for general Windows
administration and can run the logon scripts as each user logs on to
the network.</p>



<p>The Windows Scripting Host is included with Windows 98 and 2000, or
can be obtained from <a tARGEt="_blank" href="http://../msdn.microsoft.com/scripting">http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting</a> for
Windows 95 and NT. It's packaged as two executables:
<i>cscript.exe</i>
<a name="idx2069"></a>,
a command-line tool, suitable for running from the Windows command
prompt; and
<i>wscript.exe</i>
<a name="idx2070"></A>,
a GUI application generally run from Windows Explorer.</P>



<P>WSH uses simple text files to hold the script code; Python files run
under the Windows Scripting Host using the extension
<I>.pys</I>. There are no tags or any other special
characters needed, so WSH files that use Python are syntactically
identical to a Python source file. The only difference is that if the
code were executed directly by Python, the object model exposed by
WSH is not available.</P>



<p>Version 5 of the Windows Scripting Host supports the objects
described in <A href="pythonwin32_snode165.html#17">Table 21.2</a>.</P>

<p>You can run this script from a command prompt and see the output:</p>



<pRE CLASs="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt;cscript wsh.pys Hello
Microsoft (R) Windows Scripting Host Version 5.0 for Windows
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation 1996-1997. All rights reserved.

The script name is wsh.pys
The first argument is Hello
Z: = \\SKIPPY\d_drive

C:\Scripts&gt;</PRe>


<P>Alternatively, you could use the GUI version of WSH by executing the
command:</P>



<pRE CLASs="monofont">C:\Scripts&gt;wscript C:\Scripts\wsh.pys Hello</pre>


<P>This command can be executed from a command prompt or from the
Windows Start <IMG bordER="0" ALign="absmiddle" wIDTH="20" height="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Run menu item. It should be possible to execute
a <i>.pys</i> file by double-clicking it in Windows
Explorer, but Python currently doesn't support this.</p>



<p>When you execute the script under the GUI version, notice that all
the <tt claSS="monofont">WScript.Echo()</TT> calls are displayed as message
boxes rather than printing a console message. This means that the
example generates three message boxes. Depending on the needs of your
script, either or both versions of WSH may be suitable.</P>

Blurring the edges: WSH or straight Python</h5>


<P>One of the questions that may come to mind is "Why
bother?" Python provides much of this functionality via the
Win32 Extensions, and the native Python code is often simpler than
the WSH version. For example, <Tt CLaSS="monofont">sys.argv</TT> and
<TT clasS="monofont">os.environ[]</TT> are certainly less to type than
<Tt claSS="monofont">WScript.Arguments</TT> and
<tt clASS="monofont">WScript.CreateObject
(</Tt>"<tt class="monofont">WScript.Shell</tt>"<tt class="monofont">).Environment</tt>.</p>



<p>To further blur the distinction, it's worth noting that much of
the functionality provided by WSH is exposed via the
<TT CLASs="monofont">WScript.CreateObject()</TT> function. This function is
almost identical to the Python function
<tT ClASS="monofont">win32com.client.Dispatch()</TT>; it creates a COM
object by name.</P>



<p>What this means is as long as WSH is installed on a machine, Python
can still make use of most WSH objects, even when not running under
WSH. For example, you can call <tt cLASS="monofont">EnumNetworkDrives()</tt>
from a Python prompt as follows:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; from win32com.client import Dispatch
&gt;&gt;&gt; net=Dispatch("Wscript.Network")
&gt;&gt;&gt; netInfo=net.EnumNetworkDrives()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print "%s=%s" % (netInfo[0], netInfo[1])
Z:=\\SKIPPY\d_drive
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pRE>


<P>You have the best of both worlds: you can make use of all
Python's features when running under WSH, and also make use of
the best WSH features when running standard<A name="idx2071"></a> <a name="idx2072"></a>
Python.<a name="idx2073"></a></p>
