<h3>21.4
How Active Scripting Works</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx2079"></a>This section discusses some internals of
the Active Scripting mechanism. Although this information isn't
necessary for you to use Python in an Active Scripting environment,
it may help you understand some of the intricacies of the Active
Scripting implementations. Understanding this section is required for
the next section.</p>



<p>As mentioned previously, Active Scripting is a COM-based technology
and works by providing an object model for the end user. It should
come as no surprise that this object model is provided by COM.</p>



<P>To summarize a complicated specification in a few paragraphs,
here's the general process an application uses when using
Active Scripting:</P>



<OL type="1">
<LI><P>Determines the language to be used for a particular script block and
creates the language engine as a normal COM object. Thus,
<Tt class="monofont">VBScript</tt>, <tt class="monofont">JScript</tt>, and
<tt clASS="monofont">Python</TT> are the COM ProgIDs used for the languages
described here.</P>
</lI>
<Li><P>Passes the language engine a series of named items. Each named item
is a COM object (that is, an <Tt CLASS="monofont">IDispatch</Tt> pointer)
with a name and attributes. The attributes include whether the item
is considered global and whether the item fires events.</p>
</li>
<LI><P>Each named item is placed in the namespace by the language engine.
Any named items that fire events have the event-handling mechanism
put in place. In addition, any object considered global should have
all its methods and properties made available as global methods and
properties.</P>
</li>
<li><P>The application then gives the language engine the script code to
execute. When the code refers to an object previously placed in the
namespace, the language engine makes a standard COM call on the COM
<TT Class="monofont">IDispatch</TT> pointer passed for the named item.</P>
</Li>
</ol>

<p>Let's reconsider the original example in the previous section
"Internet Explorer." When IE loads the Python engine, it
passes a number of standard items (such as <tt class="monofont">Window</tt>,
<tt class="monofont">Document</tT>, and so forth). In addition to the
standard items, a number of additional items are passed dependent on
the HTML content. In the example, an item named
<TT CLAsS="monofont">TestForm</Tt> and each element in the form are added.
Many of these items may source events (such as the user interface
<TT cLASS="monofont">Window</TT> and form element objects), but only a few
are considered global. Internet Explorer designates the
<tt clASS="monofont">Window</Tt> items as global, and if you refer to the IE
documentation you will note that the <tt cLASS="monofont">Window</tt> item
has an <tt CLASs="monofont">alert()</tt>
<a name="idx2080"></a> method; hence you can refer to the
<tt class="monofont">alert()</tt> method globally, as in that first example.</p>



<p>Internally, everything is achieved using normal COM concepts; all
method calls and property references are done with
<tT CLASS="monofont">IDispatch</tT>, as discussed in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</A>. All event handling is done using normal
<TT CLAss="monofont">IConnectionPoint</tt> interfaces, and although beyond
the scope of this book, is fully supported by the standard Python COM
framework.</P>
