<h3>22.1
Python and Visual C++</h3>


<p>Python is written in C and can be embedded in both C and C++ programs
and extended with routines written in C and C++. The standard Python
documentation includes a good <a NAME="idx2087"></a>tutorial on extending and embedding
Python, which we won't repeat, and we certainly won't try
to teach you C.</p>



<p>There are a number of reasons to use <a NAME="idx2088"></a>Visual C++ during your travels with
Python:</p>



<ul>
<LI><P>To build Python from sources. Many companies that ship Python
binaries like to know they can build everything from C sources and
have control over those sources (for example, checked into their
source control system). The same applies to all Python extensions
your application may use.</P>
</li>
<li><p>To write a Python extensions as a DLL or if you have the sources to
an interesting Python extension, but no binary for Windows for your
Python version.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To make an existing C or C++ library available to Python.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To embed Python in a C or C++ application for one of the many good
reasons for doing so!</p>
</li>

</TD>
</tr></taBLE></Td></tr></tABLE></p>

<p>Many of you are familiar with compiling C programs (and Python) on
Unix, while others aren't C programmers at all. Although we
attempt to make this chapter understandable for C novices, we
certainly don't attempt to teach either the C++ language or the
Microsoft Developers Studio environment.</p>




<h4>22.1.1
One Size Doesn't Fit All</H4>


<P>
<A Name="idx2089"></a>It should be noted that once you start
delving into building from sources, the world takes a murkier turn.
When you download different source packages and attempt to build them
into a single system, things rarely work as expected first time
around.</p>



<p>One of the biggest problems is <a name="idx2090"></a>interproject dependencies. If you
download the core Python sources, they will probably build well.
However, if you then download some other Python extensions (such as
the Win32 or COM sources), you may strike some problems when Visual
C++ tries to find the Python files (such as header or library files)
it needs.</p>



<p>The fundamental problem is that every programmer stores his or her
source code in a different directory structure than everyone else.
Sometimes these directory structures are dictated by corporate
policy, or sometimes they are personal taste. Even worse than this is
the problem of changing between versions of Python and other
extensions you use. When a new version of Python comes out, you will
probably need to change every single project file to reference the
new version.</p>



<p>To attempt to make this problem bearable, here are a couple of tricks
to make working with source code easier:</p>



<ul>
<li><P>Don't specify <I>Python15.lib</I>,
<I>PyWinTypes.lib</I>, or
<I>PythonCOM.lib</i> in your project file. These
packages employ a Visual C++ trick so that by including the necessary
headers (such as <I>Python.h</I> or
<i>PyWinTypes.h</I>), an implicit reference is made to
the necessary <I>.lib</i> files. This automatically
uses the correct release (e.g., <I>Python15.lib</I>) or
debug library (<I>Python15_d.lib</I>), and is also
useful when upgrading Python; for example, Python 1.6 will presumably
change the names of these <I>.lib</I> files, but this
scheme avoids changing your project in that case.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Use Microsoft Visual C++ to specify the Python and other directories
globally, rather than on a per-project basis. This allows you to
avoid referencing the location of the Python sources directly in your
project file and applies for all projects. When you wish to move to a
new version of Python, you can change Visual C++ so it references the
new directories and rebuild all your projects.</P>
</Li>
</ul>

<h5>22.1.1.1
Configuring Visual C++ to build Python or extensions</H5>


<P>
<A Name="idx2091"></a>The process of configuring Visual C++
in the manner described previously is quite simple. The first thing
to do is to determine the location of the necessary Python files. If
you installed the binary version of Python, these files are likely
under the <I>C:\Program Files\Python\Include</I> and
<I>C:\Program Files\Python\libs</I>. If you are
building from the Python source archive, the directories for the
headers may be something like
<i>Python-1.5.2\include</i> and
<i>Python-1.5.2\pc</i>, while the library files would
be in <i>Python-1.5.2\pcbuild</i>. Then perform the
following steps:</p>



<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start Microsoft Visual C++.</p>
</li>
<li><P>Select Tools <IMG BOrDEr="0" ALiGN="absmiddle" WIDTh="20" heiGHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alT="figs/U2192.gif"> Options <IMG bordER="0" ALign="absmiddle" width="20" height="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Directories. Drop down the Show
Directories For combo box, and select Include Files. Add the
directory or directories where the Python headers can be located.
Your screen should look something like <a href="pythonwin32_snode172.html#4">Figure 22.1</A>.</P>
</lI>
<Li><P>Select the combo box again, select Library files, and update the
directories appropriately.</P>
</lI>
<LI><P>Select OK to close the dialog, and you're ready to go!</P>
</Li>
</ol>

<img BORDer="0" width="502" height="253" src="FILES/ppw.2201.gif" alt="figs/ppw.2201.gif"></ceNTER>


<P>You may also wish to perform this same process for other common
Python extensions you use. For example, you may make extensive use of
the Win32 or COM extensions so you could perform this same procedure
and specify their directories. Indeed, if you wish to build the COM
extensions from sources you may need to ensure your directories are
set up so that <I>PyWinTypes.h</i> and
<I>PyWinTypes.lib</I> from the Win32 extensions can be
found.</p>








<H4>22.1.2
Building an Extension Using Visual C++</H4>


<p>
<A NAME="idx2092"></A> <a namE="idx2093"></A>One of Python's most
powerful features is how well it integrates with extensions written
in C. If you have a library or toolkit available for C or C++, it is
almost certain you can expose this library to Python using an
extension module.</P>



<P>Alternatively, you may have a program with special requirements, such
as crunching huge complex datasets, and your program could benefit
immensely if you could speed up one small, but important part of the
application. Writing this small speed-critical part in C and calling
it from your Python program is an attractive solution many people
adopt.</p>



<p>For whatever reason you need to do this, we provide here a short
discussion of extension modules and building the modules on Windows.</p>



<p>For this example, we use a simple extension module from the Python
tutorial. This creates a module called <TT CLass="monofont">spam</tT> and
exposes a function called <TT Class="monofont">system()</tt>, which runs a
DOS command. This is obviously a contrived example as this same
functionality can be obtained from the Python function
<tt class="monofont">os.system()</tt>; indeed, you would expect to find
almost identical code implementing <tt clasS="monofont">os.system()</TT>.
The source code is as follows:</P>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont">/* spammodule.c - pasted from Python extending/embedding manual*/

# include "Python.h"

static PyObject *SpamError;

static PyObject *spam_system(self, args)
    PyObject *self;
    PyObject *args;
{
    char *command;
    int sts;
    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "s", &amp;command))
        return NULL;    
    sts = system(command);
    return Py_BuildValue("i", sts);
}

static PyMethodDef SpamMethods[] = {
    {"system",  spam_system, METH_VARARGS},
    {NULL,      NULL}        /* Sentinel */
};

#ifdef MS_WIN32
__declspec(dllexport)
#endif

void initspam()
{
    PyObject *m, *d;

    m = Py_InitModule("spam", SpamMethods);
    d = PyModule_GetDict(m);
    SpamError = PyErr_NewException("spam.error", NULL, NULL);
    PyDict_SetItemString(d, "error", SpamError);
}</pRE>


<P>The format for Python extensions is well covered in the standard
Python documents and in the various books to date. Our target is
simply to get it to build on Windows. When this is done, you should
end up with a file named <I>spam.pyd</I>, and be able
to use it just like the following example:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import spam
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam.system('start notepad')
0
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>And you see a <I>notepad</I> appear on the screen.</P>




<H5>22.1.2.1
You take the high road...</h5>


<p>Before we start on a fairly long spiel about how to create a
Microsoft Visual C++ Project file by hand, we would be remiss not to
make mention of a handy Python tool that can save you lots of
heartache and may let you skip the next section completely!</p>



<p>Python on Unix has a well-established build procedure that uses a
file named <I>setup.in</I> to control the build
process. Each different operating system reads the
<I>setup.in</I> file and generates an appropriate
<i>makefile</i> for the system.</p>



<p>
<a name="idx2094"></a>David <a name="idx2095"></a>Ascher has developed a tool that takes one
of these Unix <i>setup.in</i> files, generates a
Microsoft Visual C++ project file, then invokes Visual C++ to build
the project. Although this would appear to be of interest mainly for
people with existing Unix source code, these
<i>setup.in</i> files are so simple that creating one
of these files for our project is simpler than mastering Visual C++.</p>



<P>The simplest possible <I>setup.in</I> file consists of
two lines. The first line contains <TT ClASs="monofont">*shared*</TT> (this
tells Unix systems the module is to be built as a shared module, the
equivalent of a DLL on Windows). The second line consists of the name
of the module we wish to build, and the source files needed to build
it. The <i>setup.in</I> file contains the following two
lines:</P>



<PRE Class="monofont">*shared*
spam spammodule.c</PRE>


<P>Here, the module is called <tt clASS="monofont">spam</Tt> and there is a
single source file, <i>spammodule.c</i>.</p>



<P>The tool that creates the Visual C++ project file is a single Python
source file,
<I>compile.py</I>
<A name="idx2096"></a>, available from <a target="_blank" href="http://../starship.python.net/crew/da/compile/default.htm">http://starship.python.net/crew/da/compile/</a>.
You can also find it, along with this book's code samples, at
<a tarGET="_blank" HREf="http://../starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/ppw32/default.htm">http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/ppw32/</A>.</P>



<p>Using this tool to build the sample is simple; create a directory
with <I>spammodule.c</I> and
<i>setup.in</I> files, and from this directory, run the
compile tool. A Visual C++ project is generated and the project
built. Let's try this out. For this example, assume that
<I>compile.py</I> is in your
<I>C:\Scripts</I> directory and the spam files in
<I>C:\Scripts\spam</i>:</p>

<p>The script creates Visual C++ Project (<i>spam.dsp</i>)
and Workspace (<i>workspace.dsw</i>) files (you can
specify a different name for the workspace file by providing it as an
argument to <i>compile.py</i>). There are some
miscellaneous files created by the build process as well as two
directories. The <i>tmp</i> directory is where the C
object files (<i>.obj</i> ) files are stored, and
<i>pyds</i> is where the final Python extension is
built. As you can see, the extension weighs in at around 20 KB.</p>



<p>All that's needed now is to copy the final
<i>spam.pyd</i> to a directory on the PythonPath.
<i>C:\Program Files\Python\Dlls</i> is where Python
installed some standard extensions, so this may be suitable. Once
<I>spam.pyd</I> is in a location where Python can find
it, the sample code presented earlier should work.<A NAMe="idx2097"></A></P>






<h5>22.1.2.2
...and I'll take the low road</H5>


<P>There will be cases where you choose to use Visual C++ yourself
rather than rely on the <i>compile.py</I> tool covered
in the previous section. Although this takes longer to set up and
doesn't provide a portable build solution, it does provide
greater control over the build process. Of course, you're free
to use both solutions: use the compile tool to generate your first
project file and workspace, but maintain them manually after
creation.</P>



<P>
<A NAme="idx2098"></a>Either way, we will briefly discuss
creating a project file from scratch using Visual C++ that builds our
<i>spam</I> sample. Here are the three steps:</P>

of the project settings. Specifically, you need to:</p>



<ul>
<LI><P>Change the C runtime library settings so the extension and Python
share this library. This is a fairly obscure requirement, but
it's needed to prevent the extension module crashing under
specific circumstances (see the later section <A href="pythonwin32_snode172.html#21">Section 22.1.3</A> for more information).</P>
</LI>
<li><p>Change the extension of the final DLL to <i>.pyd</i>.

easy identification of Python extensions versus normal Windows DLLs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you wish to perform a debug build, you need to change the debug

<p>You need the full Python sources to build a debug version of your
extension, as <I>Python15_d.dll</I> isn't
distributed with the Python binaries. Instead of building a full
debug version, consider keeping the standard release build, but
temporarily modifying the project settings to include debug
information. As discussed later in this chapter, as long as you
ensure that the C runtime library in use is Multithreaded DLL,
everything should work correctly.</p>


</TD>
</TR></TAble></tD></TR></Table></P>

<P>Everyone works differently, so exactly how you manage your
environment depends on your circumstances, but there are a number of
other tips that relate to making your built extension module
available to Python.</P>



<P>One alternative is to modify your PythonPath to explicitly include
the directory where your PYD files are built; in our example, that
would be <i>D:\MyStuff\Spam\Release</i>. Then the
latest changes are available to Python as soon as the project is
built, with no need to copy the extension anywhere else. A further
refinement to this is to exploit the fact that release and debug
builds create different files, <i>spam.pyd</i> and
<I>spam_d.pyd</I>. This allows you to change your
project to build our extensions into the same directory, avoiding the
need to specify one directory for release builds and another for
debug builds.</P>



<P>A second alternative is to exploit a feature in Visual C++ that
allows you to execute an arbitrary command after your extension has
built. It's quite common to use this feature to copy the final
extension to another directory already on your PythonPath. To set
this up, again go to the Visual C++ Project Settings, and
you'll find, way off to the right in the available tabs, is
Custom Build. Selecting this allows you to specify a simple copy
command. <a href="pythonwin32_snode172.html#19">Figure 22.6</a> shows the project setup to copy
files into the <i>C:\Program Files\Python\DLLs</i>
directory.</p>

<P>You're now almost ready to build, but faced with one
Windows-specific complication the <i>compile.py</i>
tools managed to hide. The problem is that you need to tell Windows
that your <a nAME="idx2099"></A>module-<a name="idx2100"></a>initialization function
(<tt class="monofont">initspam()</tt>) is a public function, so Python can
call it as the module is loaded. There are a number of ways to do
this, the most common being: providing a <a name="idx2101"></a> <A NAME="idx2102"></A>module definition
(<i>.def </I>) file, adding a special
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">/EXPORT:initspam</TT> argument to the linker or
modifying the code itself. For this demonstration let's take
the last option and modify the module-initialization code from the
original:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">void initspam()
{</Pre>


<p>To:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">#ifdef MS_WIN32
__declspec(dllexport)
#endif

void initspam()
{</PRE>

<h5>22.1.2.2.3

<p>Finally, we're ready to build the project. Perform the
following steps:</p>



<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose Build <iMG BORDeR="0" AlIGn="absmiddle" WIDTH="20" HeighT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Set Active Configuration and select Win32 Release.</p>

<h4>22.1.3
Debug Versus Release Builds</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx2106"></a> <a naME="idx2107"></A>A couple of times now, we have
glossed over some differences between debug and release builds for
our extensions and Python. This is a symptom of the important,
although somewhat technical, issue of the <A NAmE="idx2108"></A>C runtime library.</p>



<P>If you don't know what a C runtime library is or don't
care about the technical details, the simple rules to follow are:</P>



<uL>
<LI><P>Release builds of your project must use the Multithreaded DLL and
link with the standard Python <I>.lib</I> files.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Debug builds of your project must use the Debug Multithreaded DLL C
run-time library, must link with the <TT clasS="monofont">_d</TT> version of
the Python <I>.lib</i> files, and must themselves be
named following the <tt cLASS="monofont">_d</tt> convention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is simple to set up, as we demonstrated when building the
<i>spam</i> sample. The compile tool described
previously automatically creates the correct settings, so in some
cases you don't need to do anything. However, a deeper
understanding of the issues will help you understand why the
<tt class="monofont">_d</tt> convention exists and how to exploit or work
around it for your situation. Feel free to skip the rest of this
section.</p>



<p>The underlying issue is that Python and its extensions are DLLs, and
these DLLs need the same C runtime library. Particularly at issue are
<TT CLASs="monofont">FILE</TT> objects and memory allocated via
<tT ClASS="monofont">malloc()</TT>. If all Python extensions aren't
using the same C runtime library, the <Tt claSS="monofont">FILE</TT> objects
passed between Python and the extensions are considered invalid. The
result is likely to be an access violation.</p>



<p>Although this problem isn't unique to Windows, Microsoft Visual
C++ is one of the few compilers that provide different libraries for
debug and release builds. The debug libraries are useful and contain
all sorts of diagnostic and sanity checks for using these objects. As
a result, it's common for a programmer to build a debug version
of his module, but attempt to run it with a release version of Python
or other modules. The result is a problem far worse than he was
originally trying to debug, so Python invented a scheme to avoid this
common pitfall.</p>



<p>The idea is that when Python itself is built for debug, it looks for
only modules with <TT CLass="monofont">_d</tT> appended to the name. A debug
build of Python then finds only specific debug modules, and a release
build of Python finds only release modules.</P>



<P>As you can see, the <Tt class="monofont">_d</tt> convention is not a true
solution to the problem; the underlying issue is that Python and all
the extensions must be built with the same, shared C runtime library.
Python's use of <tt class="monofont">_d</tt> is a convention that
makes the more common errors less likely. This convention also means
it's possible to have both debug and release builds of the same
extension in the same directory. When you run
<i>Python.exe</i>, the release extensions are
automatically found. When you run <i>Python_d.exe</i>,
the debug extensions are found without needing to change the
PythonPath. This makes debugging quite simple: just run
<I>Python_d.exe</I> under the debugger and your debug
extension module can be debugged automatically.</P>



<P>The biggest problem with this scheme is that to debug a single
extension module, you must have debug builds of every extension
module your program uses. Depending on the application, this may be
difficult and even impossible. You can exploit this information to
make your debugging easier. Because the issue we have been discussing
is the C runtime library, you can change almost every other compiler
or linker option for your debug or release build except this. Thus,
for your release build, you can temporarily disable optimizations and
enable symbolic debugging information; just make sure the C runtime
library never changes. Then step through your extension in the C
debugger (but not through Python or other extensions) before
restoring the default project settings.</P>







<H4>22.1.4
Building Python Itself</h4>


<P>
<A nAMe="idx2109"></A>There are occasions when it's
necessary or desirable to build Python itself from its sources. As
mentioned previously, reasons may include wanting to build a debug
version, or simply the satisfaction or security of knowing you can
build your entire project from scratch.</P>



<P>The process is quite simple, and Python builds easily. The sources
come with Visual C++ project and workspace files, and building is as
simple as opening the workspace and starting the build.</P>



<P>The sources are available
from<A name="idx2110"></A>
<A TArget="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/default.htm">http://www.python.org</a>, usually in
a file with the name <i>pythxxx.tgz</i>, where
<i>xxx</I> is the version of Python. For example,
Python 1.5.2 sources are available in
<I>pyth152.tgz</I>. The
<I>.tgz</i>
<a name="idx2111"></a> file is a gzipped <i>tar</i>
file and is understood by the ubiquitous <a name="idx2112"></a>WinZip program (<a targeT="_blank" HREF="http://www.winzip.com/default.htm">http://www.winzip.com</A>). Once you expand this
archive into a suitable directory (be careful to maintain the
directory structure when expanding), you should have a Python-1.5.2
directory with a number of subdirectories including
<i>PCBuild</I>, <I>Python</i>,
<I>Modules</I>, and so forth.</p>



<P>In the <I>PCBuild</I> directory you'll find
<I>pcbuild.dsw</I>; this is the Visual C++ workspace.
Once opened, Visual C++ should look similar to <A href="pythonwin32_snode172.html#23">Figure 22.7</A>.</P>

<IMG Border="0" width="502" height="299" src="FILES/ppw.2207.gif" alT="figs/ppw.2207.gif"></CENTEr>


<P>Depending on your requirements, you may wish to build some or all of
the projects. At a minimum, you need to build the
<I>Python15</i> project that builds
<I>Python15.dll</I> (or
<i>Python15_d.dll</I> for debug builds). All built
files are placed in the <I>PCBuild</I> directory, ready
to be distributed, copied to the Windows System directory, etc.</P>



<P>Visual C++ generates large numbers of temporary files, often totaling
megabytes. When you have created a DLL or EXE you are happy with, you
may choose to copy it somewhere else and choose Build <Img boRDER="0" aligN="absmiddle" WIDth="20" heIGHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Clean.
This deletes all the built files reclaiming the list disk space.</p>







<h4>22.1.5
Embedding a Python Interpreter in a C++ Application</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx2113"></a>The process we
described previously of building a DLL extension module for Python is
known as <i>extending</i>
<a naME="idx2114"></A>
<A NAmE="idx2115"></A>Python;
you extend its capabilities with a new module. The other common
process is to put Python inside another existing application,
possibly for use as a macro or extension language. This process is
known as <i>embedding</I> Python.</P>



<p>If you look at the files Python installs, notice that the bulk of
Python itself is implemented in a DLL,
<I>Python15.dll</I>, for all Python 1.5.x versions.
<I>Python.exe</I> itself is tiny, and simply uses the
Python DLL. In fact, consider <I>Python.exe</I> as a
trivial example of how to embed Python in your application.</p>



<p>Python exposes a large API that embedded programs use. This API is
large and rich; almost anything you can do from Python code you can
do from the C
<a nAME="idx2116"></A>
<a namE="idx2117"></A>API,
including running code, calling objects, creating new objects,
pulling apart Python objects (such as getting the string value from a
Python string object), and so forth.</P>



<P>The best way to get started with embedding Python is to read the
excellent extending and embedding documentation (optionally installed
with Python) in conjunction with the sample in the
<i>Demo\Embed</i> directory of the Python sources. You
can then peruse the <i>Python/C API</i> documentation
(also optionally installed with Python).</P>
