<h3>22.3
Python and Delphi</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx2125"></a> <a naME="idx2126"></A>The Big
Three development environments must be Visual Basic, Visual C++, and
Borland Delphi. Delphi users feel that the language and development
environment combine the ease of use of Visual Basic with the power of
C++, and the Visual Component Library that comes with Delphi does a
superb job of hiding the complexities of the Windows API. Delphi is
particularly popular in Europe, where Pascal has often been the
teaching language for computer science.</P>



<p>Delphi uses <a naME="idx2127"></A>Object Pascal, the latest stage in the
evolution of <A name="idx2128"></a>
<a name="idx2129"></a>Pascal.
Like C++, Delphi is a fully compiled language that allows both
high-level object-oriented programming and
"down-to-the-metal" manipulation of raw memory and
pointers. It's a pure Windows tool that allows you to write
DLLs and EXEs and to access all the Windows API calls. It also
supports the C calling convention. This means that in theory Delphi
can access the main Python DLL in the same way as C/C++ programs, and
can compile DLLs Python can use as extensions.</p>



<p>During 1997 and 1998, a package called <a name="idx2130"></a>PyDelphi (included in the examples for
this chapter at <a tARGET="_blank" HrEF="http://../starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/ppw32/default.htm">http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/ppw32/</a>
and also available at <A TaRGET="_blank" HRef="http://www.multimania.com/marat/delphi/index.htm">www.multimania.com/marat/delphi/index.htm</a>)
evolved through a merger of work by Morgan
<a NAME="idx2131"></a>Martinet,
Dietmar <a naME="idx2132"></A>Budelsky, and Grzegorz
<A name="idx2133"></A>Makarewicz. This makes integration of
Python and Delphi at the C level almost effortless. PyDelphi includes
a Delphi package library that can be installed in the component
gallery and a comprehensive set of demos and tutorials.</P>



<P>The core component is a Pascal module called
<I>PythonEngine.pas</i>, which declares Pascal types to
match those in <i>Python.h</i> and function headers to
match most of those exported by the Python DLL. This makes it
possible to access Python the same way as C/C++. Going on from this,
the authors provide a number of components that represent the Python
engine itself, Python modules and variables, and I/O components.</p>




<h4>22.3.1
Embedding Python in a Delphi Application</h4>


<p><a href="pythonwin32_snode174.html#4">Figure 22.8</a> shows the first example from the
PyDelphi tutorial.</p>

<P>
<A NAme="idx2134"></a>To
achieve this, you create a new project with the visual components
shown in <a href="pythonwin32_snode174.html#4">Figure 22.8</a>. In addition, place two special
Python-Delphi components on the form. These are invisible at runtime,
but allow you to set up many properties from the Object Inspector
rather than in code. The essential one is a
<tt class="monofont">PythonEngine</tt>, (highlighted in <a href="pythonwin32_snode174.html#6">Figure 22.9</A>).</P>

<Img boRDER="0" widtH="502" HEIght="303" src="FILES/ppw.2209.gif" ALt="figs/ppw.2209.gif"></center>


<p>The <tt class="monofont">PythonEngine</tt> component has events that can be
trapped for initialization and finalization, and—most
usefully—an <tt clASS="monofont">InitScript</TT> property of type
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">TStrings</tT>. This is a list of strings that can be
set at design time in an editor and can hold any Python code you
want.</P>



<P>In addition, you add a <TT Class="monofont">PythonGUIInputOutput</TT>
component. After setting a couple of properties, this redirects the
output of the Python engine to the upper Rich Edit window in the
form. The user can now type Python code into the lower window and
execute it with a click on a button.</P>



<P>In addition to the usual header, you need one line of code behind the
button:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  PythonEngine1.ExecStrings( Memo1.Lines );
end;</pre>


<P>PyDelphi exposes almost the entire Python C API; but Delphi also has
a very useful data structure called a <TT Class="monofont">StringList</tt>,
and <tt class="monofont">PythonEngine</tt> has some higher-level functions
to work with these, such as <tt clasS="monofont">ExecStrings</TT>, in the
previous snippet. A related and useful trick with PyDelphi is to
place invisible list boxes and memos on a form and paste chunks of
Python, or even whole modules, into them; these can easily be passed
to Python later. To distribute an application, you need to include
just the Delphi executable and the usual
<I>python15.dll</I>, plus any extra Python modules
required; these can be frozen inside the Delphi executable if
desired.<A nAMe="idx2135"></A></P>







<h4>22.3.2
Extending Python with a Delphi DLL</H4>


<P>
<A NAMe="idx2136"></a>
<a nAME="idx2137"></A>It's easy to create a DLL in Delphi
and expose it as a Python module. Let's start with one of the
PyDelphi tutorial examples, then extend it into something more
useful. The initial example exports one function to add two numbers
together. In Delphi, choose File <img bORDEr="0" aliGN="absmiddle" WIdth="20" height="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> New <img borDER="0" ALIgN="absmiddle" WiDTh="20" HEIGHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" aLT="figs/U2192.gif"> DLL to create a
DLL project, and save it. Then create a new Pascal module (called
just <I>module.pas</I>) containing the following code:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">unit module;

interface
uses PythonEngine;

procedure initdemodll; cdecl;
var
  gEngine : TPythonEngine;
  gModule : TPythonModule;

implementation

function Add( Self, Args : PPyObject ) : PPyObject; far; cdecl;
var
  a, b : Integer;
begin
  with GetPythonEngine do
    begin
      if PyArg_ParseTuple( args, 'ii:Add', [@a, @b] ) &lt;&gt; 0 then
        begin
          Result := PyInt_FromLong( a + b );
        end
      else
        Result := nil;
    end;
end;

procedure initdemodll;
begin
  try
    gEngine := TPythonEngine.Create(nil);
    gEngine.AutoFinalize := False;
    gEngine.LoadDll;
    gModule := TPythonModule.Create(nil);
    gModule.Engine := gEngine;
    gModule.ModuleName := 'demodll';
    gModule.AddMethod( 'add', @Add, 'add(a,b) -&gt; a+b' );
    gModule.Initialize;
  except
  end;
end;

initialization
finalization
  gEngine.Free;
  gModule.Free;
  frmAbout.Free;
end.</pre>


<P>You can see the similarity between this and the minimal C extension
earlier in the chapter. However, PyDelphi includes a
<TT Class="monofont">TPythonModule</tt> component that slightly changes the
initialization of the Python function names. Having written this, you
can edit the Delphi project file (extension DPR) to export the
<tt class="monofont">initdemodll </tt> function:</p>



<pre clASS="monofont">library DemoDll;

uses
  SysUtils,
  Classes,
  module in 'module.pas';

exports
  initdemodll;
{$E pyd}

begin
end.</PRE>


<p>The project can be compiled to a DLL and saved with the extension
.<I>PYD</I> somewhere on the PythonPath.</p>







<H4>22.3.3
Accessing Delphi's Visual Component Library</H4>


<p>
<A NAME="idx2138"></A> <a namE="idx2139"></A>If you are creating a
Python script to be run from a command prompt, it's perfectly
feasible to write GUI code in Delphi. The DLL could contain forms and
dialogs, which can be launched from within a DLL function called by
Python. One use for this might be to provide stock dialogs for a
Python script, although you could go further and write an entire
application that is launched from Python and uses a Delphi GUI.</P>



<P>For reasons discussed in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode157.html">Chapter 20</A>, don't
try to run DLLs that use a GUI within the PythonWin editor.
Plain-vanilla Object Pascal extensions are safe to use in any Python
IDE, but the Delphi VCL application framework and the MFC application
framework in PythonWin will both assume they are running the
application and so, you get an immediate error message.</P>



<P>The authors of the package have also written their own Python IDE in
Delphi and a tool that automatically examines Pascal source code and
generates Python wrappers for the entire Visual Component Library.
These make it possible to write Python code that creates Delphi forms
and objects and accesses their methods and properties, just as you
would in Delphi. The following is valid Python code:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">from Forms import *
from StdCtrls import *

f = TForm().CreateNew(Application)</pre>


<p>Unfortunately, this incredible capability is still experimental and
limited to use within Delphi applications; thus, you can write a
Delphi application with an embedded Python macro language that can
create and manipulate Delphi GUI elements, but you can't just
write a plain Python script. The latter is technically feasible and
it is a development we hope to see in the future.</p>
