<h3>About This Book</h3>


<p>This book is about using Python to get jobs done on Windows.</p>



<P>We hope by now you have heard of Python, the exciting object-oriented
scripting language that is rapidly entering the programming
mainstream. Although Python is perhaps better known on the Unix
platform, it offers a superb degree of integration with the Windows
environment. One of us, Mark Hammond, is responsible for many of
Python's Windows extensions and has coauthored the Python COM
support, both of which are major topics of this book. This book can
thus be considered the definitive reference to date for Python on the
Windows platform.</P>



<P>This is intended to be a practical book focused on tasks. It
doesn't aim to teach Python programming, although we do provide
a brief tutorial. Instead, it aims to cover:</P>



<ul>
<li><P>How Python works on Windows</P>
</LI>
<li><p>The key integration technologies supported by Python on Windows, such
as the Win32 extensions, which let you call the Windows API, and the
support for COM</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>Examples in many topic areas showing what Python can do and how to
put it to work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, we hope you will have a clear idea of what Python can do
and how to put it to work on real-world tasks.</p>
