<h3>D.2
Win32 Thread Support</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx2257"></a> <a naME="idx2258"></A>As Python runs on many operating systems,
the Python thread support is limited to a reasonable subset of what a
platform can be expected to provide in the way of threading. Windows
provides a number of additional features that relate to threads and
synchronization, and we discuss some of these here.</P>




<h4>D.2.1
Native Win32 Threads</h4>


<p>The <tT CLAss="monofont">win32process</tt> module provides access to the
<tt class="monofont">beginthreadex()</tt> function provided by the Microsoft
Visual C++ runtime library. This function allows you to specify a
function as the thread, as well as some custom Win32 setting for the
thread.</p>



<p>There are only a small number of situations when it's necessary
to use this function in preference to the standard
<tt clasS="monofont">threading</TT> module. The first is when you need
access to the Win32-specific features, such as the security for the
object or flags that indicate the thread should be created in a
suspended mode. Another common situation is when the main thread
requires the Win32 <TT ClASs="monofont">HANDLE</TT> of the new thread; this
is not easy using the other Python threading modules (where only the
new thread itself has easy access to this information).</p>







<H4>D.2.2
win32event Module</h4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx2259"></a>Each
application has different synchronization requirements. Some programs
may need to wait for threads to complete, while some threads may need
to wait for a file operation to complete or mutexes to become
available. To cater to these various requirements, Windows bases all
its synchronization primitives around Windows
<tT CLAss="monofont">HANDLES</tt>. When you wish to wait for something of
significance, you usually pass a handle. For example, you can wait
for a thread or process to complete by specifying its handle; you can
wait for a file operation to complete by waiting on the handle in the
<TT CLass="monofont">OVERLAPPED</tT> object you specified. You can wait for
the mutex, semaphore, event, or other objects by passing the handle
you obtained when opening or creating the object. Thus, regardless of
the type of object or event you are waiting for, you always use
handles and can use the same Win32 functions.</P>



<P>There are three functions exposed by <Tt class="monofont">win32event</tt>
that wait for Win32 objects:
<tt class="monofont">WaitForSingleObject()</tt>,
<tt clASS="monofont">WaitForMultipleObjects()</TT>, and
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">MsgWaitFor-MultipleObjects()</tT>. Each of these
functions allow you to wait for one or more handles to become
<i>signaled</I>, but exactly what signaled means
depends on the object. For example, a signaled synchronization object
typically means you have acquired the object, a signaled thread or
process handles mean the thread has terminated, and so forth.</P>



<P>Here are the three functions.</P>



<dl>
<dt>
<FONT coloR="#990000"><FONt colOR="#990000"><SPan class="monofont">WaitForSingleObject()</span></font>
</font></dt>
<DD>
<P>As the name implies, this function allows you to wait for a single
object to become signaled. It takes two parameters; the handle to the
object you wish to wait for, and a timeout in milliseconds (or
<TT ClASs="monofont">win32event.INFINITE</TT> for no timeout). The return
value from the function is
<tT cLASS="monofont">win32event.WAIT_OBJECT_0</tt> if the object becomes
signaled, <tt CLASs="monofont">win32event.WAIT_TIMEOUT</tt> if the timeout
interval expired, or <tT CLAss="monofont">win32event.WAIT_ABANDONED</tt> in
certain situations for mutexes (see the Win32 documentation).</P>
</DD>
<Dt>
<font color="#990000"><font color="#990000"><spAN CLASs="monofont">WaitForMultipleObjects()</SPaN></FoNt>
</FONT></dt>
<dd>
<P>Allows you wait for one or all of a number of objects. The first
parameter is a sequence (e.g., list or tuple) of handles, while the
second is a boolean flag indicating if you wish the function to
return when all objects are signaled (<TT Class="monofont">true</TT>) or
when any one of the objects becomes signaled
(<TT clasS="monofont">false</TT>). The third parameter is a timeout
interval, as for <Tt class="monofont">WaitForSingleObject()</tt>. The return
code from this function is similar to
<tt class="monofont">WaitForSingleObject()</tt>, except the result may range
from <tt clASS="monofont">win32event.WAIT_OBJECT_0</TT> to
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">win32event.WAIT_OBJECT_0 + len(handles)-1</tT>. If you
indicate you wish to wait for only one of the objects, this tells
which object became signaled. <a href="pythonwin32_cnode137.html">Chapter 18</a>, contains
examples of using <tt cLASS="monofont">WaitForMultipleObjects()</tt> to wait
for either a service control request or a client connection and
demonstrates how to decode the return values.</p>
</dD>
<DT>
<Font cOLOR="#990000"><font color="#990000"><span class="monofont">MsgWaitForMultipleObjects()</spaN></FONT>
</FoNT></dT>
<Dd>
<P>Almost identical to <tT CLAss="monofont">WaitForMultipleObjects()</tt> but
also allows you to detect that a Windows message is ready to be
processed by the thread. This information is particularly relevant
for both GUI programs that make use of threading, and objects that
use apartment-threaded COM objects, as described later in this
appendix. Please see <A href="pythonwin32_cnode207.html">Appendix C</a>, for a description
of these functions or the final sample in this appendix for an
example of this function's usage.</p>

<CENTeR><H2>
The Python Thread Lock</h2></CEnTeR>


<P>
<A Name="idx2260"></a>Although
Python fully supports threads, Python itself is not fully
free-threaded. Python maintains an internal lock that prevents more
than one thread from being inside the interpreter at one time.
Although this initially sounds restricting, there are a number of
reasons why it is less of a burden in practice.</P>


<P>Most
real-world programs spend their time waiting on the external world
(such as data to be read from a disk or input to arrive from the
keyboard). Most Python functions (even in extension modules) that
take significant time to execute, release the Python lock. This
leaves other Python threads free to run while this thread is waiting
for the call to complete.</P>


<P>On single-processor machines,
there is only one thread on the system executing anyway; the
operating system provides the illusion that the threads are running
at the same time. For these machines, the Python thread lock
typically doesn't impede threading performance.</p>


<p>For some applications, where multiple Python threads are
waiting on some external relatively slow process that can take
advantage of multiple processors (such as SQL database engines) you
may still find that Python's threading model provides all the
performance you need. However, if you are writing
performance-critical applications that will run on multiprocessor
computers, you should keep these threading restrictions in mind.</p>


<p>It should also be noted that Guido et al. are
considering how to remove this threading restriction. Greg Stein made
some experimental free-threaded patches for Python 1.4 that were the
inspiration for some threading changes in Python 1.5, but at time of
writing, debate is still continuing about exactly how to incorporate
free-threading changes without severely impacting performance for
single-threaded programs or on single-processor machines.</P>
