<h3>D.3
COM Threading Models</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx2261"></a>For various, and mainly historic,
reasons, COM has the concept of threading models. Most often
it's an implementation detail of little importance, so can
safely be skipped by the casual COM user. A full discussion of
COM's threading models is beyond the scope of this book (and
seemingly beyond the scope of the COM documentation!), however some
detailed information about this esoteric part of COM may help explain
odd behavior you may encounter.</p>




<h4>D.3.1
Apartment Living</h4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx2262"></a>Each object lives in what COM terms
a threading apartment, of which there are two types,
<a NAME="idx2263"></a>free-threaded
and<a name="idx2264"></a> single-threaded. A process can have
zero or one free-threaded apartments and any number of
single-threaded apartments (one for each thread with a
single-threaded object).</p>



<p>The apartment is nothing more than a conceptual framework invented by
COM to explain the rules and other nuances of using threading with
COM. An <i>apartment</i> is a grouping of objects by
their threading characteristics. Before a thread can use COM, it must
indicate its threading model (that is, if a new single-threaded
apartment should be created, or if this thread should live in the
free-threaded apartment). The apartment an object lives in is
determined either by the implementation of the object or the thread
that created the object, as we discuss later.</p>



<p>The point of the COM-threading models is to allow simple objects that
aren't written with threads in mind to be used by another
object that is thread-aware. If an object is written with the
assumption that concurrent access to the object isn't possible,
then using such an object from multiple threads is likely to be
disastrous. Therefore, threads that reside in the same apartment can
make unrestricted use of all objects in that apartment, but whenever
threads from different apartments (that is, two threads that are not
both in the free-threaded apartment) need to use an object, COM steps
in. COM uses what is known as a <i>proxy</i> to
automatically synchronize the threads so the object is correctly
called from a thread in that object's apartment. COM also
imposes rules to allow this mechanism to work.</p>
