<h3>D.4
What Apartment Do I Live in?</h3>


<p>The obvious question to arise from this is "How do I control
the apartment for my threads or objects?" There is no simple
answer.</p>



<P>Fortunately, the rules for threads are quite simple. Before a thread
can use COM, it must call one of the
<TT Class="monofont">CoInitialize()</TT>
<A Name="idx2265"></a> or
<TT CLass="monofont">CoInitializeEx()</tt>
<a name="idx2266"></a> functions and when it's done
with COM, it must call <tt class="monofont">CoUninitialize()</tt>; these
functions are exposed to Python by the
<tT CLASS="monofont">pythoncom</tT>
<A nAMe="idx2267"></A> module.
<tT CLAss="monofont">CoInitialize()</tt> predates the COM threading models,
so it initializes a new single-threaded apartment for the thread.
<TT CLass="monofont">CoInitializeEx()</tT> takes an additional parameter
that allows you to specify the threading model; thus, you must use
this function to have your thread in the free-threading apartment.
The first single-threaded apartment created (that is, the first
thread that calls either <TT Class="monofont">CoInitialize()</TT> or
<TT class="monofont">CoInitializeEx()</tt> with the
<tt class="monofont">COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED</tt> flag) is given special
significance as we discuss later, and is known as the main
single-threaded apartment.</p>



<p>To hide some of this complexity, Python calls
<tt cLASS="monofont">CoInitializeEx()</TT> automatically as soon as the
<tT ClASs="monofont">pythoncom</Tt> module is imported, and this is
significant for the following reasons:</P>



<UL>
<Li><p>The threading apartment for the first Python thread that imports the
<tt CLASs="monofont">pythoncom</tt> module is controlled by this automatic
process. By default, this thread is initialized in a single-threaded
apartment, but this can be controlled by adding a
<tT CLAss="monofont">co_initflags</tt> attribute to the
<TT CLass="monofont">sys</tt> module before importing
<tt class="monofont">pythoncom</tt> (see the final sample in this appendix).
If this attribute exists, it's passed unchanged to the
<tt class="monofont">CoInitializeEx()</TT> function by the PythonCOM
framework. For example, you could execute the following code to
ensure the main thread is initialized in the multithreaded apartment:</P>

<PRE cLAsS="monofont">import sys
sys.coinit_flags = 0 # pythoncom.COINIT_MULTITHREADED = 0
import pythoncom</PrE>
</lI>
</UL>

<Ul>
<li><p>As the default behavior is to initialize a single-threaded apartment,
this Python thread may also become the main single-threaded
apartment, as discussed previously. The implications for the main
single-threaded apartment are discussed later in this appendix.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>Only this main thread has <tt CLASs="monofont">CoInitializeEx()</tt> called
automatically.<fONT Size="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-A">[A]</a></sup></font>
 Any
other threads you create need to call
<tt CLASS="monofont">pythoncom.CoInitializeEx()</Tt> explicitly before using
COM and <TT cLAsS="monofont">pythoncom.CoUninitialize()</tT> when complete.</P>


<BLockqUOTE><font SIZE="1">
<p claSS="footnote">
<SUp><a name="FOOTNOTE-A">[A]</a></sup>
<tt class="monofont">CoUninitialize()</tt>
isn't called for the main Python thread automatically, as doing
so can often cause more problems than it solves. This function can
still be called manually from the main thread.</p>
</fONT></BLOcKQuOTe>


</Li>
</UL>
<P>The rules for which object an apartment lives in are slightly more
complex. If the COM object in question is implemented in any way
other than an <Tt claSS="monofont">InProc</TT> DLL (for example, a
LocalServer or RemoteServer EXE-based object), the question becomes
moot, as the object is running in a separate process, and therefore
can not be in the same apartment. For DLL-implemented objects, the
apartment is determined both by the apartment of the thread creating
the object and the threading models actually supported by the object.</p>



<p>When an <tt CLASs="monofont">InProc</tt> object is registered, part of the
information written to the registry is the threading models supported
by the object. This can be either <tT CLAss="monofont">Apartment</tt>, to
indicate the object must live in a single-threaded apartment,
<tt class="monofont">Free</tt> to indicate the object must live in the
multithreaded apartment, or <tt class="monofont">Both</tT> if the object
supports either technique. As discussed in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</a>, this is controlled for Python objects via the
<TT cLAsS="monofont">_reg_threading_</tT> attribute, with the default for
Python objects being <TT Class="monofont">Both</TT>.</P>



<P>If the thread creating the object and the object itself have
compatible threading models, the object is created in the
thread's apartment. If the object is an old COM object
(indicated by the lack of threading information in the object's
registration information) the object may be created in the main
single-threaded apartment. If a multithreaded apartment needs to
create a single-threaded object, COM automatically creates a new
single-threaded apartment for the new object.</p>




<h4>D.4.1
What Are the Apartment Rules?</h4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx2268"></a>For all this complicated machinery to
work, there are a number of rules COM imposes on programs that use
COM.</p>



<p>The synchronization of calls between different threads is achieved
using Windows messages. This means that all threads in a
single-threaded apartment must run a message loop to allow this
mechanism to work. If the program is a GUI (such as PythonWin) this
is no problem, but for most other applications, including Windows
Services, this may not be an existing requirement. In practice, this
means if any of your threads that exist in a single-threaded COM
apartment need to wait on some synchronization object, you may need
to use either the
<TT CLass="monofont">win32event.MsgWaitForSingleObject()</tt> or
<tt class="monofont">win32event.MsgWaitForMultipleObjects()</tt> calls so
you can still process messages at the appropriate time. If you have
no other message requirements, calling
<tt class="monofont">pythoncom.PumpWaitingMessages()</TT> processes all
messages currently in the thread's queue. This technique is
demonstrated in the example in the next section.</P>



<P>The other major rule imposed by the COM threading models is that
it's illegal to pass COM interface pointers (and therefore the
Python wrappers) between threads. As you may be passing the pointer
from the same apartment to a different apartment, you may be avoiding
or violating the synchronization mechanisms (and other optimizations)
provided by COM. To pass interface objects between threads, you must
use the
<TT cLAsS="monofont">pythoncom.CoMarshalInterThreadInterface-InStream()</Tt>
and <Tt CLASs="monofont">pythoncom.CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream()</tt>
functions to transfer objects between threads. These functions are
demonstrated next.</p>







<H4>D.4.2
Apartments Open for Inspection</H4>


<P>It's time to demonstrate some of these concepts. To do this, we
develop three COM objects, each of which support one of the various
threading models discussed previously. These COM objects are quite
simple and expose only two methods:
<Tt claSS="monofont">GetCreatedThreadId()</TT>
<a namE="idx2269"></A> to return the thread ID of the thread
that created the object, and
<TT class="monofont">GetCurrentThreadId()</tt>
<a name="idx2270"></a> to return the thread ID of the current
thread (that is, the thread receiving the call). If you have read
<a href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</a>, there will be nothing new in this
example. The only points worth mentioning are that we use
<tt CLASS="monofont">win32api.GetCurrentThreadId()</Tt> to obtain the Win32
Thread ID, and that we use a Python base class for the raw COM
functionality, and subclasses for the object-specific registration
information. The COM objects are implemented in
<I>ThreadingModelsServer.py</I>
<a NAmE="idx2271"></a>
:</P>

                       ThreadFreeObject,
                       ThreadBothObject)</PRE>


<p>Before moving to the client sample code, these objects must be
registered in the normal way.</p>



<p>The code that uses these COM objects is considerably more complex
because it's here the COM object, and the threads that use it,
are created. The general intent of the code is to create the
single-threaded object we defined and then create three threads that
use this object. The code confirms that so long as you follow the COM
rules, COM ensures that regardless of the thread actually calling the
object, the object will see the call on its single thread (i.e., the
thread that created it.) You then execute the same code but create
the free-threaded version of the object, and observe the differences.</p>



<P>Before launching into the code, there are some points to discuss:</P>



<UL>
<li><p>The main thread needs to wait for the subthreads to complete, but as
you will be running single-threaded objects in the apartment, you
need to process Windows messages. Therefore use the
<tT CLAss="monofont">win32process.beginthreadex()</tt> function to create
the thread, so that you can use the thread handles with
<tt class="monofont">win32event.MsgWaitForMultipleObjects()</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All the threads exist in separate single-threaded apartments; the
main thread because we haven't overridden the default Python
initialization by setting <tt CLASS="monofont">sys.coinit_flags</Tt>, and
each worker thread because each calls
<TT cLAsS="monofont">pythoncom.CoInitialize()</tT> rather than
<TT Class="monofont">pythoncom.CoInitializeEx()</TT>. Because all the
threads are in different apartments, you must use the
<TT clasS="monofont">CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream()</TT> and
<Tt claSS="monofont">CoGetInterfaceAnd-ReleaseStream()</TT> functions to
transfer the COM object between threads.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt class="monofont">MsgWaitForMultipleObjects()</tt> has a quirk that
usually prevents effective use of the <tt clasS="monofont">bWaitAll</TT>
parameter. If set to <TT ClASs="monofont">true</TT>, the function waits
until all objects have been signaled, and input is available.
Generally, you need to know when all objects are signaled, or input
is available. You can avoid this restriction by setting
<tT cLASS="monofont">bWaitAll</tt> to <tt CLASs="monofont">false</tt>, and each
time a thread completes remove its handle from the list before
waiting again.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>The main body of the sample code accepts the name of the COM object
as a parameter. This lets you run the same code with both the
single-threaded and free-threaded versions of the COM object.</p>
</li>

Demo of PythonThreadDemo.Free finished.</PRE>


<P>The output before the blank line represents the single-threaded
object, so let's examine that first. The main Python thread
reports itself as thread 355, and the object itself was also created
on thread 355, as expected. Each of the three threads that started to
use the object does indeed get a unique thread ID, but regardless of
the thread making the call, the object always sees the call on thread
355, the thread that created the object. You can also see that while
this simple test was running, and the main thread was waiting for the
threads to terminate, you were called upon nine times to process
Windows messages.</p>



<P>The output after the blank line represents the same test code, but
uses the free-threaded object. As you can see, the same main thread
is creating the COM object, but this time the object reports it was
created on thread 318. As this thread is in a single-threaded
apartment, and the COM object insists on a free-threading apartment,
COM has spun up a new thread to host the object. As each thread calls
the object, the object itself isn't restricted to receiving the
call on a single thread. Because you're in different apartments
the threads are still different, but the same single-threaded
restrictions don't apply. Also notice that in this scenario,
it's not strictly necessary to run a message pump, as there are
no single-threaded COM objects being hosted on the main thread.</P>



<p>To help complete the picture, we now present a fully multithreaded
example. It's almost identical to the one just presented, with
the following changes:</P>



<Ul>
<Li><P>The main thread is forced into the free-threaded apartment by setting
<TT Class="monofont">sys.coinit_flags</TT> to zero before importing
<TT clasS="monofont">pythoncom</TT>. Each worker thread is forced by calling
<Tt claSS="monofont">pythoncom.CoInitializeEx()</TT>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since all the threads are in the free-threading apartment, you can
freely pass COM objects between threads and avoid those functions
with the huge names!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since you don't need to process messages, replace the
convoluted <tt class="monofont">MsgWaitForMultipleObjects()</tt> call with a
single <TT CLASs="monofont">WaitForMultiple-Objects()</TT> call. Ideally
this code would use the Python threading model, but we've kept
the basic code layout so it's easy to compare the differences.</p>
