<h3>Who Is This Book for?</h3>


<p>We expect this book to be of interest to two groups of people:</p>



<A NAMe="idx1"></a><a nAME="idx2"></A><dl>
<dt>
<I><FONt color="#990000">Windows developers, administrators, and IT managers</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>You may be an experienced Windows developer using C++, Visual Basic,
Delphi or other development tools, or you may be involved in managing
information technology (IT) and need to make decisions as to the
right tools for large projects. No doubt you hear about several new
languages every year and meet zealots who insist that each is the
ultimate development tool. You've perhaps heard a colleague
talking about Python or read a few articles about it and are curious
why people rave about it. By the end of this book, you should know!</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<I><FONT CoLOr="#990000">Python converts from Unix</FONt></i></DT>
<DD>
<p>Python is one of the major products of the Open Source revolution
(<a naME="idx1"></A> <A name="idx2"></A><A TArget="_blank" HREF="http://../opensource.org/default.htm">http://opensource.org/</a>) and has a large
following on Unix platforms. There are a large number of Python users
within the Unix tradition who are forced, with varying degrees of
resistance, to work in a Windows environment. We hope to open your
eyes. Most of the things you do on Unix can be done on Windows, and
Windows offers exciting programming possibilities.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<p>Readers may vary considerably in their programming experience. We
don't aim to teach the language systematically and assume you
are familiar with other programming languages. Someone familiar with
Visual Basic, for example, should be able to follow most of the book.
However, some sections regarding Windows internals or C integration
assume C or C++ familiarity.</p>



<p>We assume a fairly typical business-computing platform with Windows
NT 4.0, Microsoft Office, access to the Internet or an internal
TCP/IP network, and adequate memory to run smoothly. Python is
equally happy on Windows 95 and 98, and we have tried to comment on
the differences as they occur.</p>
