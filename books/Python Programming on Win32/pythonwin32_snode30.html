<h3>3.5
Web Publishing Tools</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx318"></a>There
are a number of <a naME="idx319"></A>Internet publishing tools available
for Python. Python itself comes with its own HTTP server (web
server), which is discussed in some detail in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode117.html">Chapter 15</A>.</P>



<P>A number of packages have extended Python's capability in this
area; these include the Medusa Suite and Zope.</P>




<h4>3.5.1
Medusa</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx320"></a>Medusa is a
platform for building high-performance, long-running servers using
Python, written by Sam <a name="idx321"></a>Rushing of Nightmare Software. Medusa uses
an asynchronous model for supporting high-performance,
single-threaded servers, particularly suitable for HTTP or FTP
servers. Although Medusa comes with HTTP and FTP servers, the library
is suitable for almost any high-performance/high-load socket-based
communication; in fact, the core Medusa engine was recently adopted
as part of the standard Python library and can be found on any
standard Python 1.5.2 or later distribution.</p>



<p>Medusa is currently used by a number of mission-critical systems
around the world. It's free for personal use, although it
requires a license for commercial use.</p>



<p>Information on Medusa can be found at
<a nAME="idx322"></A> <A NaME="idx323"></a><A TaRgET="_blank" HRef="http://www.nightmare.com/medusa">http://www.nightmare.com/medusa</a>.</p>







<H4>3.5.2
Zope</H4>


<P>
<A name="idx324"></A>Zope is an Open Source application
server and portal toolkit supplied and supported by Digital
Creations. While a quick look at Zope may give you the impression
it's yet another web server, it's actually far more.</P>



<P>Most web servers earn their living by serving static HTML text, or
possibly executing code using the CGI interface. Instead of serving
HTML pages, Zope publishes "objects" stored in the
integrated object database, a relational database, or other content
systems such as LDAP servers. Zope maps these requests to Python
objects, which are retrieved from the object database and queried.
Whenever you display a page using Zope, you are actually calling some
Python <A name="idx325"></A>object. You can easily create new types
of publishable objects and use any Python facilities including
Windows-specific Python extensions. At the time of this writing a
Zope extension to facilitate the use of COM objects is in
development.</P>



<P>This provides a natural way of developing content for the Web. You
design your web page as a combination of HTML templates and a set of
objects. The templates can reference your objects to obtain the final
HTML sent to the user.</P>



<p>While Zope's HTML templates may resemble
<a name="idx326"></a> <a name="idx327"></a>IIS
<a name="idx328"></a>ASP files,
they operate quite differently. Rather than being bound to web pages
like ASP files, Zope templates are associated with Python objects. A
Zope template builds a web representation of an object by calling the
object's methods and/or calling other objects and their
templates. In this way web pages are built out of assemblages of
objects and their templates.</p>



<p>Unlike ASP, Zope can operate with almost any web server and can run
on almost any platform that supports Python. Zope comes with its own
web server, but it can also operate hand in hand with other web
servers such as IIS. When you use Zope with IIS, Zope runs as an NT
service, and IIS forwards web requests to Zope for processing.</P>



<P>As Zope is released as Open Source, it's free, including for
commercial use. In addition to customizing Zope for your own
purposes, you can participate in Zope's development by
following changes in <A NAMe="idx329"></A> <A nAMe="idx330"></A>Concurrent Versioning
System (CVS), proposing features, submitting patches, and
contributing extensions.</p>

a handy demo.</P>
