<h3>3.6
The mx Extensions</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx333"></a> <a naME="idx334"></A>Not
necessarily written for Windows platforms, but nevertheless worth a
look, are the extensions written for Python by Marc-André
<A name="idx335"></A>Lemburg.
Most extensions come with a Python-style license and can be freely
used for your own projects (although some do require a license for
commercial use: see the license for details). Many of them even
include precompiled binaries for direct use on Windows; installation
is then a matter of unzipping the package archive.</P>



<P>You can download the most recent versions from the
<I></i>
<a name="idx336"></a>Starship server, where many other
Pythoneers also keep their gems. The documentation, license
information, and download instructions are all just a few clicks away
from <a target="_blank" href="http://../starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/default.htm">http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/</a>
<a nAME="idx337"></A> <A NaME="idx338"></a>
<A NaMe="idx339"></A>.</P>




<H4>3.6.1
mxDateTime</H4>


<p><tt cLASS="monofont">mxDateTime</tt>
<a nAME="idx340"></A> provides three new object types,
<tt clASS="monofont">DateTime</Tt>, <tt class="monofont">DateTimeDelta</tt>, and
<tt class="monofont">RelativeDateTime</tt>, which let you store and handle
<a nAME="idx341"></A>
<A NaME="idx342"></a>date/time values in a
more natural way than by using Unix ticks (seconds since 1.1.70 0:00
UTC, the encoding used by the standard Python time module).
We'll see this used in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode101.html">Chapter 13</A>.</P>



<P>You can add, subtract, and even multiply instances, or use the
standard Python <Tt claSS="monofont">pickle</TT>
<a namE="idx343"></A> module to copy them and convert the
results to strings, COM dates, ticks, and some other more esoteric
values. In addition, there are several convenient constructors,
formatters, and parsers to greatly simplify dealing with dates and
times in real-world applications.</P>



<P>Besides providing an easy-to-use Python interface, the package also
exports a comfortable C API interface for other extensions to build
on. This is especially interesting for database applications that
often have to deal with date/time values; the
<tt clASS="monofont">mxODBC</Tt> package is one example of an extension
using this interface.</p>







<h4>3.6.2
mxTextTools</h4>


<p><tt class="monofont">mxTextTools</tt>
<a name="idx344"></a> includes several useful
functions and types that implement high-performance
<a NAME="idx345"></A>text-manipulation and searching
algorithms.</P>



<p>For experts, <TT cLAsS="monofont">mxTextTools</tT> also includes a flexible
and extensible state machine, the <A NAme="idx346"></a>Tagging Engine, that allows scanning and
processing text based on low-level bytecode "programs"
written using Python tuples. It gives you access to the speed of C
without having to compile and link steps every time you change the
parsing description.</p>



<P>Applications include parsing structured text, finding and extracting
text (either exact or using translation tables), and recombining
strings to form new text.</P>







<H4>3.6.3
mxODBC</H4>


<p><tt cLASS="monofont">mxODBC</tt>
<a nAME="idx347"></A> is an extension package that provides a
Python Database API-compliant interface to <a name="idx348"></a>ODBC 2.0-capable database drivers and
managers.</p>



<p>Apart from implementing the standard Database API interface, it also
gives access to a rich set of catalog methods that allow you to scan
the
<a name="idx349"></a>database
for tables, procedures, and so forth. Furthermore, it uses the
<tt class="monofont">mxDateTime</TT> package for date/time value interfacing
eliminating most of the problems these types normally introduce
(other I/O formats are available too).</P>



<P>The latest versions of the package allow you to interface to more
than one database from one process. It includes a variety of
preconfigured setups for many commonly used databases such as MySQL,
Oracle, Informix, Solid, and many more. A precompiled version of the
extension for the Windows ODBC manager is also included.</P>



<P><a href="pythonwin32_cnode101.html">Chapter 13</A> covers <tT cLASS="monofont">mxODBC</tt> in
considerable detail.</p>







<h4>3.6.4
mxStack</H4>


<P>
<A Name="idx350"></a>This is one of the smaller offerings:
<TT CLass="monofont">mxStack</tT> implements a new object type called
<TT Class="monofont">Stack</tt>. It works much as you would expect from such
a type, having <tt class="monofont">.push()</tt>
<a name="idx351"></a>
<A NAME="idx352"></A> and <tT ClASs="monofont">.pop()</Tt> methods
and focusing on obtaining maximum speed at low memory costs.</P>







<H4>3.6.5
mxTools</H4>


<P>The <tt clASS="monofont">mxTools</Tt>
<a naME="idx353"></A> package is collection of handy
functions and objects extending Python's functionality in many
useful ways. You'll find many goodies you've often missed
in this package, such as
<Tt claSS="monofont">dict()</TT>
<a name="idx354"></a>
<a name="idx355"></a> for constructing dictionaries
from item lists or a replacement for
<tt class="monofont">range(len(object))</tt> called
<TT CLASs="monofont">indices()</TT>
<a NAmE="idx356"></a>. There are more than 25 new functions
provided by this package; too many to detail here, and listing only a
few runs the risk of skipping the one you might find most useful. The
online documentation provides an excellent reference.</P>







<H4>3.6.6
mxCrypto</H4>


<P><tt clASS="monofont">mxCrypto</Tt>
<a naME="idx357"></A> is an extension package that provides
object-oriented-style access to the <A name="idx358"></A>cipher algorithms
and<A NAme="idx359"></a> hash
functions included in
<a name="idx360"></a>SSLeay, a
sophisticated cryptographic library written by Eric
<a name="idx361"></a>Young, now
maintained by the
<a name="idx362"></a>OpenSSL
(<A NAME="idx363"></A>
<a NAmE="idx364"></A><a TaRGET="_blank" href="http://www.openssl.org/default.htm">http://www.openssl.org</A>) team.</P>



<P>SSLeay/OpenSSL isn't subject to the U.S. government's
<A name="idx365"></A> <A NAme="idx366"></a>International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) export restrictions on
<a NAME="idx367"></a>cryptographic software, so it's
available worldwide.</p>







<h4>3.6.7
mxProxy</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx368"></a>This small package gives you complete
control of how an object may be accessed and by whom. It's
suitable to implement bastion-like features without the need to run
in restricted execution environments.</p>



<p>The package features secure <a name="idx369"></a>data encapsulation (the hidden
objects are not accessible from Python since they are stored in
internal C structures), customizable attribute lookup methods, and a
cleanup protocol that helps to break circular references prior to
object deletion.<a nAME="idx370"></A> <A NaME="idx371"></a></P>
