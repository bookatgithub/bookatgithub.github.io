<h3>4.2
IDLE</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx476"></a>IDLE is
an alternative Integrated Development Environment for Python. By
default, the Python 1.5.2 and later installations install IDLE and a
shortcut to start IDLE on your Start menu.</p>



<p>"IDLE" is a twist on the standard IDE acronym and is also
named after Eric <a NAME="idx477"></a>Idle, one of the sillier members of the
Monty Python comedy troupe, but don't tell him.</p>



<p>As we have discussed, many IDE functions are shared between PythonWin
and IDLE (or more correctly, stolen from IDLE by PythonWin, with
Guido's blessing). So the differences between PythonWin and
IDLE have less to do with features and more to do with platforms.</p>



<P>IDLE runs on almost all platforms that support Python. Although the
user interface it provides isn't quite as slick as
PythonWin's, you do have an IDE that runs places other than
Windows. For many people, this is the single killer feature!</P>



<P>Of course, your choice of environment is up to you, but it appears
that people who use Python on multiple platforms prefer IDLE because
their environment can follow them. People who use Python only on
Windows typically prefer PythonWin and its interface. As IDLE evolves
further and the Tkinter GUI framework offers more features on
Windows, we may find this simple distinction blurring. We recommend
you spend time with both IDE environments and choose for yourself.</P>




<h4>4.2.1
Platforms and Versions</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx478"></a>
<a name="idx479"></a>IDLE
is itself written in Python, using Tkinter, Python's de facto
cross-platform GUI package based on Tcl/Tk. Because Python and Tcl/Tk
are cross platform, so is IDLE; it works as well on Windows (95, 98,
NT) as on Unix (including Linux), with minor, unavoidable differences
because of inherent differences between the platforms. It also works
on Macintosh (although occasionally you may experience a slight
problem, because this platform gets less testing).</p>



<p>This section describes IDLE Version 0.5, which hasn't been
released at the time of writing. The Python 1.5.2 distribution comes
with IDLE Version 0.4, which differs in a number of details, so these
will be detailed where appropriate. In any case, IDLE requires Python
1.5.2 or later to run. Tcl/Tk 8.0 or later (optionally installed with
Python 1.5.2) is needed.</p>



<p>As the version number should imply, IDLE is still a young
application, and features are developing at a great rate. Check the
online documentation regularly to keep up with the current feature
set.</p>







<h4>4.2.2
Shell Window</H4>


<P>
<A NAMe="idx480"></A>When IDLE starts, it presents its shell
window. This window is equivalent to PythonWin's Interactive
Window or the interactive Python session, and it's where you
enter arbitrary Python commands.</P>



<p>By now, you should be completely familiar with Python's own
interactive (command-line) mode. We first discussed this in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode19.html">Chapter 2</A>, and also previously in this chapter, so you
already know how to use IDLE's Python shell window! <A href="pythonwin32_snode38.html#5">Figure 4.5</a> shows the Python shell window with a few
interactive commands.</p>



<CENTer>

<imG BORder="0" width="502" height="274" src="FILES/ppw.0405.gif" alt="figs/ppw.0405.gif"></cENTER>


<P>Since we made a big song-and-dance about the cross-platform
capabilities of IDLE, <a href="pythonwin32_snode38.html#6">Figure 4.6</A> shows the Python
shell window running on a Unix system. You will probably notice some
subtle differences between the two windows; the fonts are different,
hence the slightly different window sizes: the default is 80 ×
24 character cells on all platforms. You may also notice that on
Windows the <a NaME="idx481"></A>Help menu is placed next to the other
menus, while on Unix it's placed to the far right of the menu
bar.</P>

<IMg borDER="0" Width="502" height="310" src="FILES/ppw.0406.gif" alt="figs/ppw.0406.gif"></centeR>


<P>One of the first things the astute reader might query is the lack of
the <TT CLaSS="monofont">...</tT> prompt in multiline statements. Using the
"official" interactive Python mode or PythonWin,
multiline statements normally look like:</P>



<pRe CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; while x &lt; 10:
...     x = x + 1
...     print x, x**3
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<P>IDLE takes a different approach. Instead of showing secondary
prompts, Python automatically indents these lines with
<A NAme="idx482"></a> <a NAME="idx483"></a>whitespace, just like the
regular editor. This is one feature not provided by PythonWin;
although the interactive window does perform some smart indentation,
it doesn't offer the full-blown smart indentation used by IDLE
and the PythonWin editor.</p>



<p>Just like PythonWin, you can move to a previous command and press
Enter to copy the
<a NAME="idx484"></a>command to the end of the buffer, ready
for subsequent editing and execution. The shell window also provides
<a name="idx485"></a>history capabilities, allowing you to
quickly recall next and previous commands, activated by the ALT-N and
ALT-P keys, respectively.<a name="idx486"></a></p>







<h4>4.2.3
The Python Editor</h4>


<p>
<a namE="idx487"></A>
<A NAMe="idx488"></A>You can use
IDLE as an ordinary text editor to write Python programs. As
discussed previously in this chapter, PythonWin recently adopted many
of IDLE's best editor features, so the same, rich, Python-aware
editing environment is available in IDLE. It's worth noting
that IDLE and PythonWin have different default
<A nAMe="idx489"></A>keyboard
bindings, so the same features may be accessed in different ways;
check the IDLE menus for the shortcut keys.</p>



<P>IDLE also <A NAme="idx490"></a>colors the text of your
program according to syntactic categories. For example, strings are
displayed in green, so when you forget a string quote, you will
probably notice before you run the program. Other editors have this
feature, and some support Python's syntax, but not many (not
even Emacs) get it right at all times. The inaccuracy can be
annoying, especially when you are editing multiline string literals.
IDLE boasts that it gets the coloring 100% right, but you
wouldn't expect any less from a Python source-code editor
written in Python!</p>







<H4>4.2.4
Path and Class Browsers</H4>


<P>
<A name="idx491"></A>
<A NAme="idx492"></a>IDLE supports a
Python path and Python class browser by selecting the appropriate
entry from the File menu. These browsers look remarkably similar to
the equivalent browsers in PythonWin, which should come as no
surprise, as both IDLE and PythonWin use the standard Python module
<tT CLAss="monofont">pyclbr</tt> to obtain their functionality.</p>







<h4>4.2.5
Running and Importing Scripts</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx493"></a>
<a name="idx494"></a>As with PythonWin, IDLE
supports the concept of running and importing scripts. To run or
import a script, the file must be opened in the text editor and Edit
<iMG BORDeR="0" AlIGn="absmiddle" WiDTH="20" HeighT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Run Script or Edit <iMG BOrder="0" ALIGn="absmiddle" width="20" height="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Import Module selected.</p>



<p>These features work the same as under PythonWin. Since we have
experimented with these functions using PythonWin, we won't
bore you with a repeat for IDLE. However, you may still want to open
the same sample script used for PythonWin and test the features using
IDLE.</p>



<P>If a traceback is printed to the Python shell window, you can move
the cursor to one of the error lines and select the Go to file/line
option (from the Debug or right-click menus) to open the file.</P>







<H4>4.2.6
The Debugger</H4>


<P>
<A nAMe="idx495"></A>As
you expect of an IDE, IDLE contains a built-in debugger. To use the
debugger, it must first be enabled via the Debug <ImG bORDEr="0" aliGN="absmiddle" WIdth="20" hEIGHt="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" ALT="figs/U2192.gif"> Debugger
command from the Python shell window. The debugger dialog appears,
and the shell window responds with:</P>



<pre class="monofont">[DEBUG ON]
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>IDLE is now ready to debug. To start the debugger, open the script to
debug and run (or import) it. For the purposes of this example,
let's debug the same script you used for PythonWin
(<i>C:\Scripts\pywindemo.py</i> in the example). Once
the file is open, select Edit <img bordER="0" ALIGn="absmiddle" WIdTH="20" hEiGHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alT="figs/U2192.gif"> Run script (or press Ctrl-F5).
The debugger dialog becomes active, and the debugging session begins.
<A href="pythonwin32_snode38.html#11">Figure 4.7</a> shows you stopped inside your main
function.</p>



<CENTer>
<h5>

<img border="0" width="502" heighT="225" src="FILES/ppw.0407.gif" ALt="figs/ppw.0407.gif"></CEnTEr>


<P>The stack leading to the current call is shown. Selecting an entry
displays the local and global variables and the source code for the
stack entry, depending on the options selected at the top of the
dialog.</p>



<P>
<A NAme="idx496"></a>At the time of writing, there are a few
limitations in the IDLE debugger worth mentioning:</p>



<UL>
<LI><p>When debugging the top-level of a module, the Go and Over commands
function like the Step command. Go and Over don't function
correctly until the top-level script calls a function.</p>
</li>
<LI><P>The Python shell window is effectively disabled during the debugging
session. You can't use normal Python commands to view and
change variables while the debugger is active.</P>
</li>
</ul>
<P>It's quite possible that these and other limitations will be
removed by the time you install IDLE.</P>




<H5>4.2.6.1
Postmortem debugging</H5>


<p>IDLE supports <a name="idx497"></a>postmortem debugging, which allows you
to capture the state of a Python program after an exception. Unlike
PythonWin, where postmortem debugging must be explicitly enabled when
running a script, IDLE allows you to perform this analysis at any
time directly after an unhandled exception has occurred. To perform
postmortem debugging, select Debug <img border="0" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="20" HeIGhT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" aLT="figs/U2192.gif"> Stack Viewer after the
traceback has been printed. The debugger dialog is then activated,
allowing you to view the state of each stack entry in the
traceback.<A Name="idx498"></a></P>
