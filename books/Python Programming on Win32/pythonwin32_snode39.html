<h3>4.3
Conclusion</h3>


<p>This chapter provided a look at two IDEs available for Python on
Windows. Both IDLE and PythonWin allow you to develop, run, and debug
Python programs, and provide unique Python-based features you
won't find in other environments.</p>



<P>PythonWin and IDLE are not competitors; in fact, they can be viewed
as partners. The developers of both packages have gone to
considerable effort to ensure that the best features of each are
available in the other. As we have seen, the primary difference is
the GUI environment in which they run. PythonWin runs only under
Windows, and it takes full advantage of Windows features: excellent
if you use only Windows. IDLE provides the one key feature PythonWin
will almost certainly never have: its runs on all popular, modern
operating systems.</P>



<P>Hopefully this chapter has allowed you to see how each development
environment operates and encouraged you to try both. Although most
examples in this book use PythonWin to run sample programs, they all
work perfectly under IDLE, so feel free to use the environment of
your choice.<A name="idx499"></A></P>
