<h3>6.3
The Doubletalk Toolkit at Work</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx626"></a>In the next
few chapters we'll see some examples of the class library at
work. At the beginning of the chapter, we listed some application
areas. Now we'll run briefly through how the toolkit supports
some of these to give a feel for how it might be useful.</p>




<h4>6.3.1
Comparing, Combining, and Contrasting Accounts</h4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx627"></a>Imagine
that you had one accounting system until the end of 1997. You
switched in 1998, and there were some slight differences in the new
<a NAME="idx628"></a>chart of
accounts that grouped things differently at a high level, in addition
to merging one or two existing accounts. Not being administratively
perfect, you didn't get it all set up on the first of January,
and there is an annoying discrepancy at the changeover point you
can't figure out. Export scripts can be written to get the data
into <tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt>s. A dictionary can be prepared that
maps account names in the old system to account names in the new one,
and then both sets of data can be merged. Ad hoc queries using an
interactive prompt also make it easy to see where data doesn't
match.</p>







<h4>6.3.2
Building Business Models</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx629"></a>One
of the main uses of Doubletalk is building detailed
<a NAME="idx630"></A>cash-flow forecasts. Most cash-flow
forecasts are done in <A nAMe="idx631"></A>Excel, but they tend to focus only
on cash; building and maintaining a spreadsheet to correctly handle a
full balance sheet and profit and loss is hard work in Excel, and
anything less is ultimately not useful for long-term planning.
It's also important to lay out your forecast using the same
headings and tree structure as the actual data and to take care not
to leave black holes where the past data meets the future. Large
corporations have often invested a great deal in building such models
of their businesses. The combination of object-oriented programming
and our class library makes it easy.</P>



<p>The general concept is to create a hierarchy of business model
objects that represent things in the business; these generate a
stream of future transactions at the right time. The module
<I>demodata.py </i>
<A NAMe="idx632"></a>uses crude examples of this to generate a
file of 1000 transactions. Here's a simple base class for this
hierarchy:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">class BusinessObject:
    def getTransactions(self):
        return []</pRE>


<P>There are a limited number of common <A name="idx633"></A>business objects that can be modeled
quite accurately. For example, a simple loan can be described by just
four attributes: amount, date drawn, interest rate, and number of
periods. A <TT Class="monofont">Loan</tt>
<a name="idx634"></a> object is initialized with these
attributes and generates a stream of transactions covering the
drawdown and the subsequent repayments. An
<tt class="monofont">IncomeItem</tt> gives rise to an invoice and a payment
transaction, with a time lag. An <TT CLASs="monofont">IncomeStream</TT>
creates a series of <tT ClAsS="monofont">IncomeItems</TT>, perhaps with a
given annual growth rate. The model usually needs changing only a
little each month and represents cash flows accurately.</P>



<p>A more sophisticated model uses a discrete-event simulation approach,
sending ticks of the clock to the business objects and allowing
objects to make decisions based on the state of the accounts and to
interact with each other. For example, a
<tt cLASS="monofont">CorporationTax</tt> object could wake up once a year,
look at the profits, and schedule in a few payments a few months
ahead.</p>



<p>This approach is also important in the <A NAMe="idx635"></a>securities industry, where
<a nAME="idx636"></A>quantitative analysts
(<i>quants</i>) build models of portfolios of financial
instruments and see how they behave under different economic
scenarios. A financial instrument can be seen as a business model
object that gives rise to transactions at various points in its
lifetime.</p>







<h4>6.3.3
Multidimensional Analysis of Financial Data</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx637"></a>Our <tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt> and
<TT CLASs="monofont">Transaction</TT> classes can be thought of as
classifying amounts of money by time and by account—a 2D
classification. In fact, many standard financial reports follow a
format of months across the top, and accounts (drawn from some level
of the tree) down the left. Previously, we saw how to extend the
system to add any attributes we wish. This effectively makes it a
multidimensional model. Analyzing multidimensional data is a big
business currently using the buzzword <a NAmE="idx638"></a>
<A NAMe="idx639"></a>OLAP (online analytical processing).
Furthermore, a common problem is to ensure the integrity of the
double-entry while querying and selecting subsets of data. There is
almost have a data warehouse in our <tt CLASs="monofont">BookSet</tt>;
however, it's currently optimized for adding, editing, and
deleting transactions, not for querying.</p>



<P>To query the
<TT Class="monofont">BookSet</TT>
<A Name="idx640"></a>,
flatten the transactions into a separate list of facts per line.
Taking the sales transaction earlier, you might extract something
like what's in <a href="pythonwin32_snode53.html#6">Table 6.1</a>.</p>

<P>This kind of <a NAmE="idx641"></A>fact-table structure is as easy to
analyze in Python as it is in
<a NaME="idx642"></A>SQL. However, Python has
a big advantage over the database world in that it's not tied
to particular sets of facts, or column headings, beforehand.
Transactions have the following method, which converts a three-line
transaction to a list of three dictionaries, each with all the facts
about transaction and line:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">class Transaction:
    # (one method of many)
    def asDicts(self):
        dicts = []
        i = 0
        for line in self.lines:
            rowdict = self.__dict__.copy()
            del rowdict['lines']
            rowdict['account'] = line[0]
            rowdict['amount'] = line[1]
            if line[2]:
                rowdict.update(line[2])
            i = i + 1
            dicts.append(rowdict)
        return dicts</pre>


<p>Running this on the example transaction gives everything you need to
know:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(t.asDicts())
[{'Customer': 'HugeCo',
  'InvoiceNo': 199904007,
  'Project': 'P2',
  'account': 'MyCo.Capital.PL.Income.Consulting',
  'amount': 10000,
  'comment': '&lt;New Transaction&gt;',
  'date': 925247872},
 {'Customer': 'HugeCo',
  'InvoiceNo': 199904007,
  'Project': 'P1',
  'account': 'MyCo.Capital.PL.Income.Consulting',
  'amount': 15000,
  'comment': '&lt;New Transaction&gt;',
  'date': 925247872},
 {'Customer': 'HugeCo',
  'InvoiceNo': 199904007,
  'account': 'MyCo.NCA.CurrentAssets.Creditors',
  'amount': 25000,
  'comment': '&lt;New Transaction&gt;',
  'date': 925247872}]
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<p>This is just a few lines away from an SQL-like query language that
can pull out arbitrary queries from a <tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt>,
tabulating the keys it's interested in from the previous lists
of dictionaries. You also have the ability to drill down from
higher-level summaries of the data to the individual transactions
that gave rise to them.<a name="idx643"></a></p>







<h4>6.3.4
Cash-Flow Analysis</h4>


<p>
<a NAME="idx644"></A>
<A nAMe="idx645"></A>Many accounting systems can't do a
cash-flow report. This sounds shocking, but it's true. The
reason is they store the individual transaction lines, often in a
separate table for each account and have lost the transaction itself.
The cash flow report records where all the cash came from and where
it went to, and is an important tool for managers.</P>



<p>To get a basic cash-flow report, you need to look at the other lines
in all the transactions affecting the cash account. If you buy all
your supplies with cash, this report breaks down how you spent your
money. But if most sales and purchases are on account, the system
produces the earth-shattering observation that most of your cash
comes from other people paying your bills, and it goes to pay other
peoples' bills. We'll call this the Brain-Dead Cash-Flow
Analysis (BDCFA). A general ledger doesn't formally store the
information needed to trace through the system and see what the bill
you just paid was actually for.</P>



<p>This analysis is easy to do, if you tag the transactions with a
customer and invoice number. Write a script to find all transactions
with a given invoice number, add together the invoice and payment
using the magic addition methods, and then perform a BDCFA on that.
This lets you trace where cash went through a series of transactions.</P>

Putting It Together</H4>


<P>
<a namE="idx646"></A>In
the context of a business, our toolkit could easily be (and has been)
used to:</P>



<Ul>
<li><p>Hold data exported from an accounts system</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>Generate future data from a financial model</p>
</lI>
<LI><P>Put the past and future together on the same basis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Analyze this stream in various ways to produce the data for reports</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dig down to extract more detail from totals in reports</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compare this month's actual/forecast data against what we
thought we would achieve at the beginning of the year<a naME="idx647"></A></P>
</LI>
</uL>
