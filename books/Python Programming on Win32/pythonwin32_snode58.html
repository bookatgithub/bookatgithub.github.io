<h3>7.2
A VB Client</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx666"></a>Next,
we've created a VB application with a multiple document
interface. You can do this by hand and add the forms and modules you
need, or use VB's Application Wizard and strip out the stuff
you don't need. We've defined a public variable called
<tt cLASS="monofont">BookServer</tt> and three public methods in the form,
<tt CLASs="monofont">InitCOMServer</tt>, <tt class="monofont">CloseCOMServer</tt>,
and <tt class="monofont">TestCOMServer</tt>, and hooked them up so that
<TT CLASs="monofont">InitCOM-Server</TT> is called when the form loads:</p>



<PRe ClASS="monofont">Public BookServer As Object

Private Sub MDIForm_Load()
    InitCOMServer
    frmJournal.Show
End Sub

Private Sub MDIForm_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
    CloseCOMServer
End Sub

Sub InitCOMServer()
    'called when the program starts
    On Error GoTo InitCOMServer_error
    Set BookServer = CreateObject("Doubletalk.BookServer")
    Exit Sub
    
InitCOMServer_error:
    Dim msg As String
    msg = "There was an error trying to initialize the BookServer." + _
            "Please check that it is properly registered and try the Python " + _
            "test functions first.  The program will now abort."
    MsgBox msg
    End
    
End Sub

Sub CloseCOMServer()
    Set BookServer = Nothing
End Sub

Sub TestCOMServer()
    'just to check it is alive
    Dim hopefully_four As Integer
    hopefully_four = BookServer.Double(2)
    MsgBox "2 x 2 = " &amp; hopefully_four &amp; ", so your server is alive"
End Sub


Private Sub mnuToolsTestServer_Click()
    'this helps establish if the COM server is alive
    'using a minimal diagnostic function in the modMain module
    TestCOMServer
End Sub</Pre>


<p>That the COM server isn't registered is a common error, so you
need to handle this error and close the program immediately if it
occurs.</p>



<P>It's not necessary to explicitly unload the
<TT Class="monofont">BookServer</TT>; it's freed automatically when
the VB program closes down. However, it's good programming
practice to free variables explicitly to show that you know when
it's happening, and it provides the right hook in case you want
to do some extra processing at this point (such as committing changes
to a file or database).</P>



<P>We've also added a menu item on the Tools menu to call our test
function. Hit Run, and the application should start up. If you get as
far as the main screen, it should have a live Python COM server
inside it. To prove it, click on Tools <img bORDEr="0" align="absmiddle" width="20" height="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" aLT="figs/U2192.gif"> Test Server, and you
should see <A href="pythonwin32_snode58.html#2">Figure 7.1</A>.</P>



<cENtEr>
<H5>
<A NAme="2"></a>Figure 7.1. Not much of a GUI yet!</h5>

<IMG BordeR="0" WIDth="502" heIGHT="100" src="FILES/ppw.0701.gif" alt="figs/ppw.0701.gif"></center>


<p>Now we've got this running, we can start to expand the
capabilities of the COM server and add the code to call it on the VB
side. We've added a number of public methods, declaring them in
the <tt class="monofont">_public_methods_</tT> attribute as we implement
them.</P>




<H4>7.2.1
Building the First View</H4>


<P>
<A nAMe="idx667"></A>Adding
the following methods to your <Tt ClASS="monofont">COMBookSet</Tt><i>
</i>allows you to load a data file, see how many transactions
the <tT CLAss="monofont">BookSet</tt> contains, and then build a view that
displays a Journal, a listing of all the transactions in date order:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont"># more methods for COMBookSet - must be named in _public_methods_
    def load(self, filename):
        self.__BookSet.load(str(filename))

    def count(self):
        # return number of transactions
        return len(self.__BookSet)
    

    def getTransactionString(self, index):
        return self.__BookSet[index].asString()</PRE>


<p>In <tt class="monofont">load</tt>, you perform a
<tt class="monofont">str(filename)</tt> operation to convert the Unicode
filename from COM into an ordinary Python string. Then pass the
request to the delegate Python <tt CLASS="monofont">BookSet</Tt> instance.
Most methods follow this pattern, doing any necessary transformations
of arguments on the way in and out and passing the real work onto the
delegate.</P>



<P>Now you need to open files. This is the VB code for the File <iMG bOrDER="0" Align="absmiddle" WIDTh="20" heiGHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alT="figs/U2192.gif">
Open menu option (generated by one
of VB's Wizards and so is somewhat verbose):</P>



<PRe class="monofont">Private Sub mnuFileOpen_Click()
    Dim sFile As String
    With dlgCommonDialog
        .DialogTitle = "Open"
        .CancelError = False
        'ToDo: set the flags and attributes of the common dialog control
        .Filter = "Doubletalk Journal Files (*.dtj)|*.dtj"
        .ShowOpen
        If Len(.FileName) = 0 Then
            Exit Sub
        End If
        sFile = .FileName
    End With
    BookServer.Load sFile
    
    'display something helpful in the Journal caption
    frmJournal.Caption = sFile &amp; ", " &amp; BookServer.count &amp; " Transactions"
End Sub</pre>


<p>The only line of interest here is in
<tt class="monofont">BookServer.Load</tt> <tt CLASS="monofont">sFile</Tt>, where
Python is asked to do the work. Then, clicking on File <IMg BOrDeR="0" ALIgn="absmiddle" wiDTH="20" HeighT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Open
lets you open a <tT CLAss="monofont">BookSet</tt> stored on disk. The
Doubletalk package includes one file created by the
<i>demodata1.py</i> script with a thousand
transactions; it takes about one second to load on a Pentium 120. The
various other loading and saving methods in your
<tt class="monofont">COMBookSet</tt> class can be hooked up to menu items in
a similar manner.</p>



<p>Next, build a <a namE="idx668"></A>Journal view, an
<A NAMe="idx669"></A>MDI child
window to display a list of transactions in date order. This has a
list box filling its client area and some code to resize it smoothly.
It also has a method called
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">UpdateView</TT>
<A Name="idx670"></a> as follows:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">Public Sub UpdateView()
    'make a list with a string describing each transaction
    
    Dim count, i As Integer
    Dim trantext As String
    Dim tran As Object
    
    Screen.MousePointer = vbHourglass
    lstJournal.Clear
    
    For i = 0 To frmMain.BookServer.count - 1
        trantext = frmMain.BookServer.getOneLineDescription(i)
        lstJournal.AddItem trantext
    Next i
    
    Screen.MousePointer = vbDefault
    Caption = "Journal view - " &amp; lstJournal.ListCount &amp; " transactions"
    
End Sub</PRE>


<p>The implementation of this <tt cLASS="monofont">UpdateView</tt> method is
simple: first ask the <tt class="monofont">Book-Server</tt> for the number
of transactions, then for the text representation of each one in
turn. These are added to the list one at a time. When run, you see a
view like <a href="pythonwin32_snode58.html#4">Figure 7.2</a>.</p>



<cenTER>
<H5>
<A NaME="4"></a>Figure 7.2. The first view</H5>

<ImG bORDEr="0" widTH="502" HEight="225" src="FILES/ppw.0702.gif" Alt="figs/ppw.0702.gif"></ceNTER>


<p>We'll define a range of views in the next few pages, all with
an <tt class="monofont">UpdateView</tt> public method. You can then ask them
all to
<a name="idx671"></a>redraw
themselves whenever the data changes. Later on we will see some other
techniques that remove the need to do the looping in VB; the Python
COM framework can return a list of strings or allow VB to iterate
over the <tt claSS="monofont">BookSet</TT> directly.</P>



<P>At this point, it's worth it to pause and reflect. We have
built the engine of an application in Python, but delivered it inside
an industry-standard, 100% Windows user interface of the kind users
expect.</p>







<H4>7.2.2
More About Transactions</H4>


<p>
<A NaMe="idx672"></A>
<A NAme="idx673"></a>You'll want to add and edit
individual transactions. This leads to more fundamental design
considerations. You need to expose
<tT CLAss="monofont">Transaction</tt>
<A NAMe="idx674"></a> class as a COM server. You also need
to think about how to create these transactions and manage their
lifecycles and about the right choice of patterns. One option is to
make a
<tt CLASs="monofont">COMTransaction</tt>
<a name="idx675"></a> class the same way we did for
<tt class="monofont">COMBookset</tt>.</p>



<p>The overall goal is to make sure that code that works with
transactions in VB is as similar as possible to the corresponding
code in Python. The VB code to create and add a new transaction looks
like this:</p>



<PRE CLAsS="monofont">    Dim newtran As Object
    
    Set newtran = CreateObject("Doubletalk.Transaction")
    newtran.setDateString "31/12/99"
    newtran.setComment "Python on Windows Royalty Cheque"
    newtran.addLine "MyCo.Assets.NCA.CurAss.Cash", 5000
    newtran.addLastLine "MyCo.Capital.PL.Income.Writing"
    
    BookServer.Add newtran</PrE>


<P>There is another choice, however. Adding a factory method to
<tT cLASS="monofont">BookServer</tt> gives a new transaction (outside of the
<tt CLASs="monofont">BookSet</tt> but otherwise fully formed). In this case
there is no need to register the class at all; it's never
created directly from the registry. Microsoft Office uses this model
a lot. Most of the Excel objects are obtained from the application
object's <a NAME="idx676"></a>factory methods and are not directly
creatable. If you go this way, your VB code to add a transaction
looks like this:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">    Dim newtran As Object
    
    Set newtran = BookServer.CreateTransaction
    newtran.setDateString "31/3/2000"
    newtran.setComment "Even more royalties"
    newtran.addLine "MyCo.Assets.NCA.CurAss.Cash", 5000
    newtran.addLastLine "MyCo.Capital.PL.Income.Writing"
    
    BookServer.Add newtran</pre>


<p>The benefit is that the <tt class="monofont">COMTransaction</tt> class can
be much smaller.</p>



<p>We've added a class called <tt clASS="monofont">COMTransaction</TT> to
<I>comservers.py</i> that delegates to a pure Python
transaction. This provides all the
<A NaME="idx677"></a>methods needed to edit and create
transactions in your client code. Here's an example:</P>



<pRE CLass="monofont">class COMTransaction:
    # we don't need all the _reg_ stuff, as we provide our own
    # API for creating these and don't use the registry.
    _public_methods_ = [
                'asString',
                'getDateString',
                'setDateString',
                'setCOMDate',
                'getCOMDate',
                'getComment',
                'setComment',
                'getLineCount',
                'getAccount',
                'getAmount',
                'addLine',
                'addLastLine',
                'getOneLineDescription'
                ]
    
    def __init__(self, tran=None):
        if tran is None:
            self._tran = doubletalk.transac.Transaction()
        else:
            self._tran = tran       
        
    def asString(self):
        return self._tran.asString()
    
    def getDateString(self):
        return self._tran.getDateString()
    
    def setDateString(self, aDateString): 
        self._tran.setDateString(str(aDateString))
    
    def setCOMDate(self, comdate):
        self._tran.date = (comdate - 25569.0) * 86400.0
        
    def getCOMDate(self):
        return (self._tran.date / 86400.0) + 25569.0

    def getComment(self):
        return self._tran.comment

    def setComment(self, aComment):
        self._tran.comment = str(aComment)
       
    def getOneLineDescription(self):
        return '%-15s %s %10.2f' % (
            self._tran.getDateString(), 
            self._tran.comment,
            self._tran.magnitude()
            )
    
    def getLineCount(self):
        return len(self._tran.lines)
    
    def getAccount(self, index):
        return self._tran.lines[index][0]
        
    def getAmount(self, index):
        return self._tran.lines[index][1]
    
    def addLine(self, account, amount):
        self._tran.addLine(str(account), amount)
       
    def addLastLine(self, account):
        self._tran.addLastLine(str(account))</pRE>


<P>This example has a number of interesting features:</P>



<ul>
<li><P>Like <TT Class="monofont">COMBookSet</TT>, this has an instance variable
called <TT class="monofont">self._tran</tt> pointing to a pure Python
transaction instance. You can pass in an existing transaction on
initialization to wrap it up, or it creates one if none is provided.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There's no need to register it at all, since you will create
instances from a factory method provided in
<tt class="monofont">COMBookSet</tT>. The only special attribute needed is
the list of public methods.</P>
</LI>
<LI><p>Since Python dates use a different representation than Microsoft, we
have provided <TT cLAsS="monofont">setCOMDate</tT><I> </I>and
<Tt claSS="monofont">getCOMDate</TT><i> </i>methods to handle
the conversion. Python's date system is that of Unix, counting
seconds since 1/1/1970; COM uses the Excel format of days since
31-Dec-1899. We also offer <tt CLASs="monofont">setDateString</tt> and
<tT CLAss="monofont">getDateString</tt> methods to sidestep the need for a
conversion routine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rather than expose <tt class="monofont">comment</tt> as a simple attribute,
we have implemented <tt CLASS="monofont">setComment</Tt> and
<TT cLAsS="monofont">getComment</tT> methods. These let you convert the
Unicode string. As a general principle, we are not directly exposing
any attributes (although the Python COM framework does allow it).</P>
</LI>
<li><p>We provided some extra methods to get the number of lines and to
retrieve a specific account name or amount using an index. These let
you write a VB loop to get all the lines. Alternative ways of
exposing the detail rows would be to return arrays (which are covered
later in this chapter) and enumerators (which appear in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
</li>
</UL>
<P>Now we need to look at how to get hold of these and store them in our
<Tt claSS="monofont">BookServer</TT>. At this point you need to do a little
more conversion and understand a little more about COM. In the
previous VB example to create and add a transaction, there were
actually three different
<tt class="monofont">Transaction</tt>
<a name="idx678"></a> objects involved. The raw one used by
VB is an <tt clasS="monofont">IDispatch</TT>
<A NAmE="idx679"></A><i> </I>object.
<Tt ClASS="monofont">IDispatch</Tt> is a standard COM interface that lets
you attempt to call any method or property and finds out later
whether they work; the Python COM framework creates these around
Python objects. Hiding within this is an instance of our
<tt cLASS="monofont">COMTransaction</tt> class, written in Python. And
because you are using a delegation mechanism, you have your own pure
Python <tt CLASs="monofont">Transaction</tt> class as an attribute of the
<tT CLAss="monofont">COMTransaction</tt>. When you create new transactions
to use with COM or try to add ones to the <tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt>,
you have a little more conversion to do.</p>



<p>This method in <tt clasS="monofont">COMBookSet</TT> creates a new
transaction for Visual Basic to use:</P>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont">def createTransaction(self):
        comTran = COMTransaction()
        idTran = win32com.server.util.wrap(comTran)
        return idTran</pRe>


<P>Before handing this out to a client language such as VB, call the
<TT Class="monofont">wrap</TT>
<A Name="idx680"></a> utility. This creates a
<TT CLass="monofont">PyIDispatch</tT> wrapper around the Python object,
which is what VB actually works with. More information on wrapping
Python objects for COM can be found in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</a>.</p>



<p>When you want to add a new transaction to the
<tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt>, you need to unwrap it to get at the
Python object inside:</p>



<pre claSS="monofont">def add(self, idTran):
        comTran = win32com.server.util.unwrap(idTran)
        pyTran = comTran._tran
        self.__BookSet.add(pyTran)</PRE>


<P>Throughout this code we have
<a NAmE="idx681"></A>prefixed the
<tT cLASS="monofont">PyIDispatch</tt> object with <i>id</i>,
the Python COM classes in <I>comservers.py</I> with
<I>com</I>, and the pure Python classes in
<i>bookset.py</i> and <i>transac.py</i>
with <I>py</I>.</P>



<P>If you design your application purely to work with COM and not for
general Python use, you can take another tack and store the
<tt clASS="monofont">PyIDispatch</Tt> objects in the list.<a name="idx682"></a> <a name="idx683"></a></p>







<h4>7.2.3
Adding and Editing Transactions</h4>


<p>
<a namE="idx684"></A>Now
we are ready to add and edit transactions. The natural thing to do is
to allow a double-click on a transaction to lead to a special dialog
for editing. This should perform the necessary validation to ensure
that the transaction balances before the dialog is closed, and, if
there is a change, it should update all of the current views.
We've built a pair of dialogs in VB: one to edit transactions
and the other (called from it) to edit individual line items. <A href="pythonwin32_snode58.html#10">Figure 7.3</A> shows the transaction dialog.</P>



<cENtEr>

<IMG BordeR="0" WIDth="502" heIGHT="250" src="FILES/ppw.0703.gif" alt="figs/ppw.0703.gif"></center>


<p>The code to edit the transaction is exposed as a method of the form
as follows:</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">Public Function Edit(index As Integer) As Boolean
    'returns true is the transaction was successfully edited
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim linecount As Integer
    
    Set tran = frmMain.BookServer.getTransaction(index)
    
    'display the transaction details
    lblTranIndex.Caption = Str(index)
    txtDate.text = FormatDateTime(tran.getCOMDate)
    txtComment.text = tran.getComment
    
    linecount = tran.getLineCount
    grdItems.rows = linecount + 1
    For i = 0 To linecount - 1
        grdItems.TextMatrix(i + 1, 0) = tran.GetAccount(i)
        grdItems.TextMatrix(i + 1, 1) = tran.getAmount(i)
    Next i
    Set tran = Nothing
    UpdateFormState
    
    'display and allow editing
    Me.Show vbModal
    
     If FormExit = vbOK Then
        Set tran = frmMain.BookServer.CreateTransaction
        tran.setComment txtComment.text
        
        If IsDate(txtDate.text) Then tran.setCOMDate 
                                                         CDbl(CDate(txtDate.text))

        
        For i = 1 To grdItems.rows - 1
            tran.AddLine grdItems.TextMatrix(i, 0), _
                                    CDbl(grdItems.TextMatrix(i, 1))
        Next i
        frmMain.BookServer.Edit index, tran
        Set tran = Nothing
        Edit = True
    Else
        Edit = False
    End If
    
End Function</PRE>


<P>This example is one of many ways to organize the code. Fetch a
transaction from the <Tt CLaSS="monofont">BookSet</tT> and display its
attributes in the user interface before discarding it. Then display
the dialog modally : the user must finish using the dialog before the
<tT CLAss="monofont">Edit</tt><I> </I>method continues. During
this period, quite a bit of validation code is running; the OK button
is enabled only if the transaction is valid and in balance. If OK is
clicked, the transaction is valid. Now create a new
<TT clasS="monofont">COMTransaction</TT><I> </i>to hold the
data, copy the data from the user interface into it, and tell the
<tt cLASS="monofont">BookSet</tt> to accept this as a replacement for the
its existing data in that position. An alternative might be to work
with the same transaction throughout.</p>



<p>
<a name="idx685"></a>The
dialog also exposes a method to add a new transaction; this displays
an empty dialog, but behaves identically after displaying the form.</p>



<p>To summarize, you can now add and edit transactions from Visual
Basic. The techniques used would be the same for any kind of nested
or master-detail object. The VB code to do this looks extremely
natural and straightforward, pretty much the same as the Python code
for creating transactions. On the server side, you need to
distinguish between the <tt class="monofont">PyIDispatch</tt> objects COM is
using and Python's internal representations, but this needs to
be done only once per class.<A NAME="idx686"></A></p>







<H4>7.2.4
Building Views with Arrays</H4>


<p>
<A NaMe="idx687"></A>
<A NAme="idx688"></a>So far we've seen examples of
passing numbers, strings, and Python objects back and forth between
Python and VB. Now we'll develop some more kinds of views and
look at passing around arrays of data at a time. This is a real time
saver and can simplify the preceding code in several places.</p>



<P>Many financial reports take the form of a 2D grid or spreadsheet.
What's needed is a generic solution for getting a Python list
of lists into such a grid. In the last chapter we showed a number of
<TT Class="monofont">BookSet</TT> methods for getting a list of accounts,
the details of an account and so on. For example,
<TT clasS="monofont">getAccountDetails</TT> returns a list of tuples of
<Tt class="monofont">(transaction</tt> <tt class="monofont">number</tt>,
<tt clASS="monofont">date</TT>, <Tt CLaSS="monofont">comment</tT>,
<tT CLAss="monofont">amount</tt>, <TT CLass="monofont">runningTotal)</tT>. This is
effectively a matrix with five columns but an unknown number of rows.
You need to expose this the usual way in
<TT Class="monofont">COMBookSet</TT>, but then access the entire matrix from
VB. The Python COM framework automatically converts lists (or lists
of lists, or lists of tuples) into arrays that can be accessed in VB.</P>



<P>We've created a new form, <tt class="monofont">frmAccountView</tt>,
which can be given the name of an account as a string. This has a
Microsoft FlexGrid control called <tt class="monofont">grdTable</tt>.
Here's the <tt cLASS="monofont">UpdateView</TT> method that fetches
and displays the data:</p>



<PRe CLaSs="monofont">Public Sub UpdateView()
    Dim table As Variant
    Dim rows As Integer, cols As Integer
    Dim row As Integer, col As Integer
    
    table = frmMain.BookServer.getAccountDetails(AccountName)
    
    rows = UBound(table, 1) - LBound(table, 1) + 1
    cols = UBound(table, 2) - LBound(table, 2) + 1 'should be 5
    
    grdTable.rows = rows + 1  'leave room for titles
    For row = 0 To rows - 1
        For col = 0 To cols - 1
            grdTable.TextMatrix(row + 1, col) = table(row, col)
        Next col
    Next row
End Sub</PRE>

<P>Although we've hardcoded a view, it would be easy to write a
completely generic form to display any data and push the management
of views back into Python itself. We'll look at this in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode61.html">Chapter 8</a>.</P>







<H4>7.2.5
Graphics and Callbacks</H4>


<P>
<a namE="idx689"></A>It
<A Name="idx690"></a>would
be convenient to look at a graphical view of an account, so
let's create one. This allows you to illustrate another level
of integration between Python and VB: <I>callbacks</I>.
Within the framework you've just created, the VB COM client has
been accessing the properties and methods of the Python COM server.
But it doesn't have to be that way; the Python code can access
the properties and methods of any VB object, whether built-in or
user-defined.</P>



<P>You need to pass a VB form to Python, which then draws directly on
it. You could also instead write another view that grabs the same
array of data as the last one and uses VB graphics code to do the
drawing. That is a better design, since it keeps a strict separation
between the engine and interface; once you add drawing code on the
Python side, you presume that a VB form with a certain API is
provided. But this example is fun and highly instructive.</p>



<p>Let's start by creating a new form in our application called
<tt CLASs="monofont">frmAccountChart</tt>, similar to the other views so
far. Add a public method to the <tt class="monofont">COMBookSet</tt> server
called <tt class="monofont">drawAccountChart</tt>, which expects a VB form
as an argument. We'll start with a simple test: our drawing
routine sets the caption of the form with a timestamp. On the VB
side, the <TT CLASs="monofont">UpdateView</TT> method for
<tT ClAsS="monofont">frmAccountChart</TT> asks Python to do the work:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">'Method of frmAccountChart
Public Sub UpdateView()
    'ask Python to scribble on me
    frmMain.BookServer.drawAccountChart Me
End Sub</pre>


<p>The form passes itself (using the keyword <TT CLass="monofont">Me</tT>,
which is VB's equivalent of <TT Class="monofont">self</tt>) to the
<tt class="monofont">BookServer</tt>. On the Python side, here is a method
that does something visible to the form:</p>



<pre clASS="monofont">def drawAccountChart(self, vbForm):
    # Make a Dispatch wrapper around the VB Form object so we can call
    # any of its methods.
    idForm = win32com.client.Dispatch(vbForm)
    
    # access a property of the VB form
    idForm.Caption = "Python Drew this chart at " + time.ctime(time.time())</PRE>


<p>The first line is critical. The actual object passed to Python in the
variable <TT cLAsS="monofont">vbForm</tT> is a raw
<TT Class="monofont">IDispatch</TT>
<A Name="idx691"></a> object, which is difficult to use
directly. However, by creating a dynamic <TT CLass="monofont">Dispatch</tT>
wrapper around it, you can access any of its methods and properties
as a normal COM object. <A href="pythonwin32_snode58.html#16">Figure 7.5</a> shows the proof.</p>

<img BORDER="0" wIDtH="502" HeIgHT="93" src="FILES/ppw.0705.gif" alt="figs/ppw.0705.gif"></CENTer>


<p>The meaning of this wrapping is discussed in greater detail in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</a>. For now, just remember to do it for any
Visual Basic
<a naME="idx692"></A> <A name="idx693"></a>objects you want to manipulate.</p>



<p>Python can access the public methods and properties of any VB object,
not just user-interface widgets such as forms and list boxes, but
also classes you define yourself.</p>




<h5>7.2.5.1
Exposing a graphics API to Python, a more complex example</h5>


<p>
<a name="idx694"></a>
<a namE="idx695"></A>Now let's extend what we just did
and let Python do some real work. VB provides a
<A NAMe="idx696"></A>picture control that allows
<A nAMe="idx697"></A>drawing. However,
some of the drawing methods use an esoteric syntax with hyphens, seen
nowhere else in VB, and which no other language could reasonably be
expected to call. You should therefore provide your own easy-to-use
graphics API in VB at the form level. Add a single picture control
called <tT CLAss="monofont">picChart</tt> to
<TT CLass="monofont">frmAccountChart</tT>, along with code to fill the
entire form when the form is resized. Then add a few methods to the
Visual Basic form to make it easier to do the graphics. Python can
then call these methods. Here is the minimal graphics API defined for
<TT Class="monofont">frmAccountChart</TT>:</P>



<Pre class="monofont">'Visual Basic code to provide a minimal graphics API
Public Sub DrawLine(x1 As Integer, y1 As Integer, x2 As Integer, _
                    y2 As Integer, color As Long)
    picChart.FillStyle = vbTransparent
    
    picChart.Line (x1, y1)-(x2, y2), color
    ' see what we mean about the funny syntax?
    
End Sub
Public Sub DrawBox(x1 As Integer, y1 As Integer, x2 As Integer, _
                   y2 As Integer, lineColor As Long, _
                   isSolid As Boolean, fillColor As Long)
    If isSolid Then
        picChart.FillStyle = vbSolid
    Else
        picChart.FillStyle = vbTransparent
    End If
    picChart.fillColor = fillColor
    picChart.Line (x1, y1)-(x2, y2), lineColor, B
End Sub

Public Sub DrawText(x As Integer, y As Integer, size As Integer, _
                    text As String)
    picChart.CurrentX = x
    picChart.CurrentY = y
    picChart.FontSize = size
    picChart.Print text
End Sub

Public Function GetClientArea() As Variant
    'return a two-element variant array
    GetClientArea = Array(picChart.Width, picChart.Height)
End Function</pre>


<p>This code gives one method to clear the chart, and three methods to
draw lines, boxes (filled or otherwise), and place text with a choice
of font size. There's also a method that says which account the
form is tracking and another method to return the dimensions of the
form, so you can figure out how to scale the chart.</p>



<p>The <tt class="monofont">drawAccountChart</tT><I> </I>method
in our Python COM server now needs to do three things: first, it
queries the form to find out which account to draw; then it queries
it to determine its size; finally it uses the graphics methods to do
some drawing.</P>



<P>We won't repeat all the chart code but here are a few lines:</P>



<pRE cLAsS="monofont">def drawAccountChart(self, vbForm):
    # Make a Dispatch wrapper around the vb Form object so we can call
    # any of its methods.
    print 'Drawing chart...'</pRE>


<P>Note the <Tt claSS="monofont">print</TT><i> </i>statement. In
normal use this won't go anywhere. However, the Python COM
framework provides a debugging mode for COM servers and a tool for
collecting these traces. It took a few tries to get all of the
scaling right, and we used numerous <tt CLASs="monofont">print</tt>
statements to examine the <a NAME="idx698"></a>data.<a name="idx699"></a></p>








<h4>7.2.6
Debugging COM Servers</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx700"></a>
<a namE="idx701"></A>At
this point, we need to briefly explain how to debug a COM server. The
theory behind this is covered in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</A>.
It's easy to use: just run the COM server script
(<I>comservers.py</i> in our case) with the argument
—<TT cLaSS="monofont">debug: </TT>note the double hyphen. The output
of any <tt clASS="monofont">print</Tt> statements in the server code can
then be seen in the <a naME="idx702"></A>Trace Collector window on the PythonWin
Tools menu.</P>



<p>Now it's time to work with the form passed in from Visual Basic:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">idForm = win32com.client.Dispatch(vbForm)</pre>


<p>As before, you wrap the VB object using <tt class="monofont">Dispatch</tt>:</p>



<pre clASS="monofont"># call a method we defined on the VB form
# arrays are converted automatically to Python tuples we can access
(width, height) = idForm.GetClientArea()
account = idForm.GetAccount()</PRE>


<p>The previous line is interesting for two reasons. First, you called a
public method of the VB form you defined. This works in exactly the
same way as calling methods of built-in VB objects. Second, you
received back an array. Earlier we saw that a Python list or tuple
can be passed to VB, where it's interpreted as a
<A NaME="idx703"></a>
<A nAME="idx704"></A>variant array. The
<tt clASS="monofont">GetClientArea()</Tt>
<a naME="idx705"></A> method of our VB form returned a
two-element variant array, which is received as a straightforward
tuple. You can pass arrays easily in both directions. (Bear in mind
that if VB returns an array containing strings, they are Unicode
strings that must be tidied with the <Tt claSS="monofont">str</TT>
function).</p>



<pre class="monofont"># access a built-in property of the VB form
idForm.Caption = "Account " + account

#############################################################
# now for the chart drawing - calling our own VB methods...
#############################################################
        
idForm.ClearChart()    #clear the form

# if the area is too small to do anything with, exit
if width &lt; 1440:
    return
if height &lt; 1440:
    return
        
#work out the inner drawing rectangle
plotrect = (720,720, width-720, height - 720)
        
# draw a blue bounding rectangle
idForm.DrawBox(plotrect[0], plotrect[1], plotrect[2], plotrect[3], 0xFF0000,
     0xFFFFFF)</pre>


<p>We've omitted the rest of the charting code, but as you can see
in <a href="pythonwin32_snode58.html#19">Figure 7.6</a>, it works rather nicely.</p>
