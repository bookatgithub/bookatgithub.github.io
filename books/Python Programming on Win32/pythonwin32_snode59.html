<h3>7.3
Writing a Delphi User Interface</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx706"></a>Little <a naME="idx707"></A>of what
we have seen is specific to Visual Basic. You can call Python COM
servers from any language that supports COM, and we know of
substantial programs using Visual Basic, Visual Basic for
Applications, Visual C++, Delphi and PowerBuilder. We have also
implemented a cut-down <Tt claSS="monofont">BookSet</TT> browser in Delphi,
which is included in the examples for this chapter. We'll show
a few edited highlights.</p>



<p>The authors believe that Delphi is a superior language to Visual
Basic. However, in a corporate environment the choice is usually made
for you. We will try to restrain our comparisons to how each language
interacts with our Python COM server.</p>




<h4>7.3.1
Instantiating the Server</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx708"></a>We
declared a variable of type <tt class="monofont">Variant</tt><I>
</I>in the main form to hold the COM server. Delphi supports
<TT CLaSS="monofont">Variant</tT>s purely in order to support COM, although
they go somewhat against the grain in Delphi programming where the
type of every variable is specified. The Delphi code to instantiate
the server is as follows:</P>



<pRe CLASs="monofont">procedure TfrmMain.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  try
    BookServer := CreateOleObject('Doubletalk.BookServer');
    StatusBar1.SimpleText := 'BookServer running';
  except
    MessageDlg(
      'An instance of the "Doubletalk.BookServer" COM class ' +
      'could not be created. Make sure that the BookServer application ' +
      'has been registered using a  command line.  If you have modified ' +
      'the source of the server, make very sure all public methods and '+
      'attributes are spelled correctly',
      mtError, [mbOk], 0);
    Application.Terminate;
  end;
end;</pre>


<P>As with Visual Basic, one line does the work.</P>




<H5>7.3.1.1
Calling simple methods</H5>


<p>
<a naME="idx709"></A>Delphi does exactly as good a job as
VB as far as passing simple arguments is concerned. The following
example, behind the File <Img boRDER="0" align="absmiddle" width="20" height="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alT="figs/U2192.gif"> Open menu item, shows how to call
methods of the <TT CLAsS="monofont">BookSet</Tt> with integer and string
arguments:</P>



<PrE cLASS="monofont">procedure TfrmMain.Open1Click(Sender: TObject);
{prompt for a filename and ask BookSet to load it}
var trancount: integer;
    filename: string;
begin
    if OpenDialog1.Execute then
        begin
        filename := OpenDialog1.FileName;
        BookServer.load(OpenDialog1.FileName);
        trancount := BookServer.Count;
        StatusBar1.SimpleText := Format('Loaded file %s, %d transactions',
                [filename, trancount]
                );
        UpdateAllViews;
        end;
end;</pre>


<p>It's legal to declare <TT CLass="monofont">trancount</tT> as an
integer and assign the return value of
<TT Class="monofont">BookServer.Count</TT> to it, even though the Delphi
compiler can't know the type of the return value; the compiler
knows that <TT class="monofont">BookServer</tt> is a COM object and decides
that type checking is somebody else's problem.</p>








<h4>7.3.2
Unpacking Variant Arrays</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx710"></a>
<a namE="idx711"></A>Delphi's handling of variant arrays
is somewhat closer to that of C or C++ than Visual Basic. It provides
three functions to find the number of dimensions in a variant array
and the high and low bounds of a given dimension. The first of these,
<TT CLaSS="monofont">VarArrayDimCount</tT>, is extremely useful and
something VB lacks; the easiest way to find this from VB is to ask
for the bounds of higher and higher dimensions until an error occurs.
<Tt ClASS="monofont">VarArrayHighBound(array,</Tt>
<tt cLASS="monofont">dimension)</tt> and
<tt CLASs="monofont">VarArrayHighBound(array,</tt>
<tT CLAss="monofont">dimension)</tt> are the equivalents of
<tt class="monofont">UBound()</tt> and <tt class="monofont">LBound()</tT>. Arrays
returned from Python always have a lower bound of zero.</P>



<P>If you want to iterate over a 1D array, you can't use a
<TT ClASs="monofont">for</TT> <tT cLASS="monofont">each</tt> loop as in VB; instead
you need to find the upper bound of the array. Here's the code
to update a list box of accounts:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">procedure TfrmMain.UpdateAccountList;
var AccountList: Variant;
    i: integer;
begin
    lstAllAccounts.Items.Clear;
    AccountList := BookServer.GetAccountList;
    for i := 0 to VarArrayHighBound(AccountList, 1) do
        lstAllAccounts.Items.Add(AccountList[i]);
end;</pRE>


<P>The array has one dimension, so ask for the upper bound of dimension
1.</P>



<p>The expression <tt cLASS="monofont">AccountList[i]</tt> returns a
<tt class="monofont">Variant</tt>, which Delphi coerces to a string when
adding to the list box.</p>



<p>Delphi also offers more functions for constructing
<tt class="monofont">Variant</tT> arrays of given dimensions, which can
efficiently pass data to Python.</P>




<A NAMe="idx712"></A><A nAMe="idx713"></A><h5>7.3.2.1


Callbacks, or the lack thereof</H5>


<P>Unfortunately this isn't so easy as with Visual Basic. In VB,
every user interface object and class module supports automation;
that is, all their properties and methods can be accessed from Python
with the <TT clasS="monofont">Dispatch</TT> wrapper. Delphi lets you create
automation objects that can be accessed in the same way, but it
isn't done by default; the compiler just won't let you do
the following:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">procedure TfrmMain.doCallbackDemo;
begin
    {this just does not work:
    BookServer.doDelphiCallbackDemo(Self);
    }
end;</pre>


<p>However, Delphi does provide tools to create automation objects and a
wizard to make it easier. With a bit more work, you could explicitly
provide a Delphi API for your Python server to call.</P>



<P>As previously noted, we think the use of callbacks is generally a
poor design principle; the server is much more useful if not tied to
a particular GUI implementation, so this isn't much of a
limitation in<A Name="idx712"></a> practice.<a name="idx713"></a></p>
