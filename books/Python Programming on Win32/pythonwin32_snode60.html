<h3>7.4
Conclusion</h3>


<p>In this chapter we have learned how to build a functioning Python COM
server, and a graphical client application that uses it. This
approach uses each language where it's strongest: Python excels
at data manipulation and object-oriented development, whereas Visual
Basic allows you to build rich, commercial-quality user interfaces.
From the user's viewpoint, there's no way to tell she is
using Python.</p>



<P>In addition to building the core of an application in Python, this
technique offers an easy way to add a small amount of Python
functionality to existing applications. For example, if you have a
large VB application and want to use a specific Python tool or
library, you could wrap it with a COM server and call it from VB.</P>



<P>We have seen examples of the various data types that can be passed
back and forth between the two languages: numbers, strings, and
arrays. The ability to pass multidimensional arrays allows you to
move large amounts of data between the two languages without writing
a lot of conversion code. The exact rules on parameter passing are
covered later in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</A><I>,
</I>but in general it all works as expected with little effort
on your part.</P>



<p>Although we focused on VB, the client can be built in many different
development tools. We've given an example in Delphi, and we
know of people working in other environments such as PowerBuilder.</p>



<p>Although the application so far is technically interesting, it could
have been written (with a bit more work) in VB without any of
Python's powerful language features. In the next chapter we
develop our application further to offer exciting capabilities only
Python can provide.<a NAME="idx714"></a> <a name="idx715"></a></p>
