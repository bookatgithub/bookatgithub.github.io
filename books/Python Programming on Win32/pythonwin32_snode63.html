<h3>8.1
Dynamic Code Evaluation</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx721"></a>With the right documentation, your
users can already write Python scripts that create and manipulate
<tt cLASS="monofont">BookSet</tt>s and <tt CLASs="monofont">Transaction</tt>s.
However, these scripts are totally detached from your browser
application. What would be smart to do is to provide a command window
within the browser that works on the current
<tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt>. If a user creates a custom import
function and runs it, he could hit an update key and see the new
records on the screen immediately.</p>




<h4>8.1.1
Executing Commands and Evaluating Expressions</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx722"></A>
<A NAME="idx723"></a>Python
has built-in functions and statements to facilitate this dynamic code
evaluation: <TT cLAsS="monofont">eval(</TT>
<A NAme="idx724"></a><tT CLAss="monofont"><i>expression,</i></TT>
<TT clasS="monofont"><I>[globals[,</I></Tt>
<tt class="monofont"><i>locals]]</i></tt><tt class="monofont">)</tt> is a built-in
function that evaluates a string, and
<TT CLASs="monofont">exec</TT>
<a NAmE="idx725"></A>
<TT CLass="monofont"><i>expression,</I></TT>
<Tt claSS="monofont"><I>[globals[,</I></tt>
<tt CLASs="monofont"><i>locals]]</i></tt> is a statement (not a function:
no parentheses needed) that executes a string. The following
clarifies how it works:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; exec "print 'this expression was compiled on the fly' "
this expression was compiled on the fly
&gt;&gt;&gt; exec "x = 3.14"
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval("x + 1")
4.14</pre>


<p>Let's pause for a moment and consider the implications of this
code. You could pass a chunk of text to a running Python application,
and it's parsed, compiled, and executed on the fly. In Python,
the interpreter is always available. Few languages offer this
capability, and it's what makes Python a good macro language.</p>

<cENTEr><h2>
Case Study: Formula Evaluation</h2></cENTEr>


<p>In 1997, one of the authors was consulting for a large
packaging company building a database of its packaging designs. A
cardboard box has a certain geometry, which may be thought of as a
collection of flat panels joined at the edges, with a series of
folding instructions. The overwhelming majority of designs were for
cuboid boxes. This allowed the length of a certain edge of a panel to
be expressed as a formula such as "2L + 3.5W + T," where
L is the length of the product to be packed, W is the width, and T is
the thickness of the board. Packaging designers all over Europe had
been patiently entering formulae for each panel of a design into a
database for months. An urgent need arose to verify these formulae.
Using Python, it was a simple exercise to load a dictionary with the
standard variables (<tt class="monofont">L</tt>, <tt class="monofont">W</tt>,
<tT CLASS="monofont">H</tT>, <Tt CLaSS="monofont">T</TT>, and a few more for
various flap lengths), plug in some numbers, and evaluate the
expressions. Those cases that generated exceptions could be
identified easily. A Python script was rapidly produced that queried
the database and verified the integrity of all the strings. In
addition to checking for errors, it produced a report listing
standard panel sizes for a generic 400 × 400 × 400mm box.
Meanwhile, the main development team spent a great deal of time
looking for and eventually writing a library of their own to evaluate
simple numeric expressions in PL/SQL.</P>



</Td></tr></tABLE></p>


<p>You may not have consciously absorbed this until a few lines back,
but Python distinguishes between
<a nAME="idx726"></A>
<a namE="idx727"></A>expressions and statements. What
happens if you aren't sure what the user wants and get it
wrong? Here are two more examples:</P>



<Pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; exec "x+2"         # try to execute an expression - nothing happens
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval("print x+3")  # and evaluate a command - causes an exception
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;interactive input&gt;", line 0, in ?
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1
     print x+3
         ^
 SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Executing an expression is generally safe, but evaluating a statement
causes a syntax error. If the user gives a single line of input to
process, and you don't know what it is, you can try to
evaluate, then execute it if an exception occurs.</p>



<p>The <tt class="monofont">exec</tT>
<A NAME="idx728"></a> function accepts not only single-line
statements such as the previous example, but multiline ones as well.
These can range from a two-line loop command to print the numbers
1-10, to a function definition, or even a 500-line class definition.</P>



<P>You may be wondering where the variable <tT ClASS="monofont">x</TT> was
stored in the previous examples. To understand this, you need to
delve into some Python internals. The previous console commands are
executed in the <I>global
namespace</i>
<a naME="idx729"></A>, which means that
<Tt claSS="monofont">x</TT> becomes a global variable. There is a function
called <tt clASS="monofont">globals()</Tt>
<a name="idx730"></a> that allows you to examine this
namespace directly; let's see what it returns:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; # where is the 'x' kept?
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in globals().items():
...     print item
...     
('__doc__', None)
('pywin', &lt;module 'pywin'&gt;)
('x', 3.14)
('__name__', '__main__')
('__builtins__', &lt;module '__builtin__'&gt;)
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>This seems scary, but look at the third line. The global namespace is
just a dictionary, and it has an entry called <tT CLASS="monofont">x</tT>
with value 3.14. It also has a few other bits and pieces you
don't need to worry about at this point.</P>



<p>At this point we touch on a significant fact about Python: almost
everything is built out of
<A NaME="idx731"></A>dictionaries.
Objects are implemented using dictionaries; their keys are the method
or attribute names stored as strings, and the values are the
attribute values and function objects themselves. Namespaces are
dictionaries, too. And when a chunk of code is evaluated, it's
internally handed two dictionaries: one containing the
<A NAme="idx732"></a>global variables at that point in
time, the other containing the <a NAME="idx733"></a>local variables to the
current function or method.</p>



<p>This detail is interesting to language lawyers, but it also has an
immediate practical payoff: you can design a namespace to suit
yourself and execute the user's code in it. Specifically, you
can modify the global namespace of the Python process in your browser
to include a variable called <tT CLAss="monofont">TheBookSet</tt>, which
refers to the currently running <TT CLass="monofont">BookSet</tt>, or you
can create an entirely new namespace in a fresh dictionary of your
own.</p>



<p>The simplest demonstration of a COM server, which is included in
PythonWin in the file
<i>Python\win32com\servers\interp.py</i>, creates a COM
object called <tt class="monofont">Python.Interpreter</tt>. This exposes two
methods to execute and evaluate expressions, which can easily be
grafted onto any COM server. We want to build a console that lets the
user do both and returns any output, so we'll merge them into
one method called <tt cLASS="monofont">interpretString()</TT>. This either
executes or evaluates the expression; if there is a return value, you
hand a string representation of it back to the user.</p>



<P>You also need to extend the <Tt CLaSS="monofont">__init_
_()</TT>
<A Name="idx734"></a> method of the
<TT CLass="monofont">BookServer</tT> to add a namespace with the needed
global variable. Here's the new initialization code and the new
method to interpret a string:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">def __init__(self):
    self.__BookSet = doubletalk.bookset.BookSet()

    # create a custom namespace for the user to work with
    # with one variable name already defined
    self.userNameSpace = {'TheBookServer', self.__BookSet}

def interpretString(self, exp):
    """Makes it easier to build consoles.
    """
    if type(exp) not in [type(''), UnicodeType]:
        raise Exception(desc="Must be a string", \
                    scode=winerror.DISP_E_TYPEMISMATCH)
    try: 
        # first, we assume it's an expression
        result_object = eval(str(exp), self.userNameSpace)
        if result_object == None:
            return ''
        else:
            return str(result_object)
    except:
        #failing that, try to execute it
        exec str(exp) in self.userNameSpace
        return ''</PRe>


<p>It's necessary to add the statement <tt class="monofont">from</tt>
<tt class="monofont">pywintypes</tt> <tT CLASS="monofont">import</tT>
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">UnicodeType</TT> at the beginning of the module. Note
that the code accepts normal and Unicode strings and raises helpful
exceptions if the wrong kind of object is passed in. Try to evaluate
the string as an expression, then try to execute it as a statement.
If it causes an error, leave it unhandled so that the error message
can filter through to the VB user. Note that as we discuss in <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</a>, leaving an unhandled Python
<A NAMe="idx735"></a>exception
to propagate to the
<a nAME="idx736"></A>user of the object is not
considered good design, but is suitable for the purposes of this
demonstration.</p>



<p>If there is a return value, convert it as a
<a nAME="idx737"></A>string. You could return it raw,
allowing <tt class="monofont">eval()</tt> to potentially return numbers and
arrays, but there is a risk of a user expression returning something
VB doesn't expect. The intention in this example is to get back
a printable string to show the user, so make sure the return type is
always either a string representation of the data or an empty
string.<a name="idx738"></a> <a name="idx739"></a></P>







<H4>8.1.2
Grabbing Python's Output</H4>


<P>
<A NaME="idx740"></a>
<A NaME="idx741"></A>
<A NAme="idx742"></a>You now have
the hooks to execute arbitrary strings of Python code, but you
can't necessarily see the output. You need to implement one
more feature first, to capture Python's standard output, so
that <tT CLAss="monofont">print</tt> statements in your users' code
show up properly. You might think this would involve low-level
Windows process control, but actually, Python knows how to redirect
its own output. If you enter the following statements in a Python
source file or the Python DOS prompt, any subsequent output (for
example, <TT CLass="monofont">print</tT> statements) are redirected to a
file:</P>



<PRe class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; mylogfile = open('c:\\temp\\mylog.txt', 'w')
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.stdout = mylogfile
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Output can be redirected to any Python object that offers a
<tt class="monofont">write()</tt>
<a nAME="idx743"></A> method. The easiest way to grab the
output is to add just such a <TT cLAsS="monofont">write()</Tt> method to our
<TT CLASs="monofont">COMBookSet</tt> class, which stores the standard output
internally; provide another method to grab this data from VB on
demand; and start trapping the output when our instance of
<tT CLAss="monofont">COMBookSet</tt> starts. Here are the needed extra
methods:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">def beginTrappingOutput(self):
    self.outputBuffer = []
    self.old_output = sys.stdout
    sys.stdout = self
    
def write(self, expr):
    """ this is an internal utility used to trap the output.
    add it to a list of strings - this is more efficient
    than adding to a possibly very long string."""
    self.outputBuffer.append(str(expr))

def getStandardOutput(self):
    "Hand over output so far, and empty the buffer"
    text = string.join(self.outputBuffer, '')
    self.outputBuffer = []
    return text

def endTrappingOutput(self):
    sys.stdout = self.old_output
    # return any more output
    return self.getStandardOutput()</PRE>


<p>Everything but <tt class="monofont">write()</tt> is exposed as a COM public
method. When VB creates the server, add a line to call
<tt class="monofont">TheBookServer.beginTrappingOutput()</tt>.</p>



<p>A word of warning at this point: you aren't the only person
interested in Python's standard output. In <A href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</A>, you'll learn about the Trace Collector
debugging tool. This is a feature of PythonWin that enables you to
debug your COM server while calling it from VB; we used it quite a
bit in writing this chapter. If you've registered your COM
server for debugging, all the output that should have gone to the
Trace Collector shows up in your console window. That's why
we've provided some explicit methods to start and stop
trapping, rather than just to start trapping when the
<tT ClASs="monofont">COMBookSet</TT> initializes and leaving it on forever.</P>







<H4>8.1.3
Building an Interactive Console</H4>


<P>
<a namE="idx744"></A>Now we have everything needed to create
a basic interactive console. We implemented this as an extra child
window with a one-line <A Name="idx745"></a>text box for input and a multiline,
uneditable text box for output. When the user inputs an expression,
the VB console form executes the commands
<TT CLass="monofont">TheBookServer.interpretString
(</tT><TT Class="monofont"><i>expression</i></tt><tt class="monofont">)</tt>
to get the return value and
<tt clASS="monofont">TheBookServer.getStandardOutput</TT> to retrieve any
output that was generated. It then assembles these together into one
chunk of text and appends this to the output text box. <A href="pythonwin32_snode63.html#9">Figure 8.1</A> is an example of our console in action.</P>



<cENTER>
<H5>
<a namE="9"></A>Figure 8.1. A crude Python console</H5>

<Img boRDER="0" widtH="502" HEIght="398" src="FILES/ppw.0801.gif" alt="figs/ppw.0801.gif"></center>


<p>Note you have full access to the data of your running server and can
modify its data. You can also create your own variables and generally
do anything you can from a regular Python console.</p>







<h4>8.1.4
Industrial-Strength Consoles</h4>


<p>The previous console is extremely simple and allows only one
statement at a time. Ideally, something like the interactive prompt
in PythonWin would be preferable. There is actually quite a lot of
work involved in writing such a window, and we won't go through
the code to do it here. As text is entered a line at a time, your
interpreter window needs to decide if it's a complete
expression and when to process the input, as well as suggest indent
levels for subsequent lines, and so on. The event-handling depends a
great deal on the type of GUI widget used to build the console.</p>



<P>If you want to build such a console, look at the file
<I>code.py</I>
<A NAmE="idx746"></A> in the standard Python library. This
contains a function called
<tT ClASS="monofont">interact()</TT>
<A name="idx747"></A> that defines an interactive console
written in Python. It needs adapting, but shows the general approach;
as each line is entered, it tries to evaluate the current text
buffer, and assumes the statement is incomplete if it gets an error.
You could modify this to provide hooks for your VB console.
<I>Code.py</I> is used by both IDLE and Pythonwin to
emulate the Python interactive mode.<A name="idx748"></A></P>







<H4>8.1.5
Executing Scripts</H4>


<p>
<a naME="idx749"></A>Quite
often the user wants to execute simple scripts. If the user has
created a simple script in a file on disk, it can be run with the
built-in function <Tt class="monofont">execfile
(</tt>
<a name="idx750"></a><tt class="monofont"><I>file[,</I></TT>
<TT cLAsS="monofont"><I>globals[,</i></TT>
<TT CLass="monofont"><i>locals]]</I></TT><Tt claSS="monofont">)</TT>. This is
broadly equivalent to the <tt clASS="monofont">exec</Tt> statement discussed
earlier, except that it's a function, and it takes
<tt class="monofont">filename</tt> as an argument, processing the entire
contents. To expose this, we've implemented a new method of
<tt class="monofont">COMBookSet</tt><i>, </i>which takes the
filename as a single argument, and calls
<TT CLASs="monofont">execfile(</TT><tT ClASS="monofont"><I>filename</I></Tt><tt cLASS="monofont">,</tt>
<tt CLASs="monofont"><i>self.userNameSpace</i></tT><TT Class="monofont">)</tt>:</p>



<pre class="monofont">def execFile(self, filename):
    if type(filename) not in [type(''), UnicodeType]:
        raise Exception(desc="Must be a string", \
                          scode=winerror.DISP_E_TYPEMISMATCH)
    execfile(str(filename), self.userNameSpace)</pre>


<p>VB provides a rich-text editor component that makes it easy to create
an editor, so we've added yet another form to our application
called
<i>frmScriptEditor</i>
<A NAME="idx751"></A>. This has a single editing region and a
menu. We provided menu options to open and save files, and it keeps
track of the filename and whether the text has changed. We
won't cover those functions here. It also has a menu option to
run a script, which is straightforward to implement:</p>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont">Private Sub mnuScriptRun_Click()
    mnuScriptSave_Click
    If Saved Then
        On Error GoTo mnuScriptRun_Error
        frmMain.BookServer.execFile FileName
        On Error GoTo 0
        frmConsole.UpdateOutput
    End If
    Exit Sub
    
mnuScriptRun_Error:
    MsgBox "Error running script:" + vbCrLf + vbCrLf + Err.Description
End Sub</PRE>


<P>We handle errors, since the user is bound to make some at some stage,
and ask the console window to display any new output afterwards. The
user interface checks that any script is saved before running it,
since we need to execute a file on disk. <a href="pythonwin32_snode63.html#12">Figure 8.2</A>
is a basic script in action, querying the running
<TT clasS="monofont">BookSet</TT> and producing some console output.</P>

<H4>8.1.6
Importing a Module</H4>


<p>
<a naME="idx752"></A>The
difference between importing a module and running a script is that a
<A name="idx753"></A>module object is created in memory with
a name you can access. All the functions and classes defined in the
module go into the newly created namespace. When executing a script,
all code is executed in the global namespace. You could let the user
import modules by typing
<TT Class="monofont">import</TT>
<A Name="idx754"></a> <tt class="monofont">foo</tt> in a console, or
even in a script executed in this manner. However, there are some
benefits to exposing this in the user interface. For example, you
could save a list of standard imports for each user in the registry
as a configuration variable and import those modules every time the
application starts up. To do this, let's take a look at
Python's import mechanism, which gives fine-grained control of
how modules are created.</p>



<p>The library module <tt clasS="monofont">imp</TT>
<A NAmE="idx755"></A> exposes Python's import
mechanism. This includes functions to search the Python
<a NAmE="idx756"></A>path for modules, and to load
<A NAMe="idx757"></a>modules
once located. Let's say you create a simple module in the file
<i>c:\temp\import\temp.py</i> that
defines one function called
<TT CLass="monofont">func(</tT><TT Class="monofont"><I>x</I></TT><tt class="monofont">)</tt>.
If you want to use this from PythonWin, ensure it's on the path
and type <tt class="monofont">import</tt> <tt cLASS="monofont">temp</TT>. Within a
custom application, you can often drop to a lower level of detail and
customize the details of this process. For example, the text for a
module might be a compiled resource in the program rather than a file
on disk, and you might want to swap different source files in and out
under the same module name. Let's look at what happens behind
the scenes of an import by recreating the steps manually.</p>



<P>First, Python looks for it with the
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">find_module</TT>
<A Name="idx758"></a> function:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import imp
&gt;&gt;&gt; found = imp.find_module('temp', ['c:\\temp\\import'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; found
(&lt;open file 'c:\temp\import\temp.py', mode 'r' at 1078200&gt;, 'c:\\temp\\import\\temp.py', ('.py', 'r', 1))
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<p><tt cLASS="monofont">find_module</tt> takes a list of locations to search as
an optional second argument; if this is omitted, it searches
<tt class="monofont">sys.path</tt>. Thus, by taking control of the import
mechanism, you can keep a separation between your Doubletalk code
locations and your general Python code; such a separation is useful
in a production application. If successful, it returns an open file
handle to the module file, the full pathname, and some background
information about the file.</p>



<p>The next step is to call
<tt class="monofont">load_module</tT>
<A NAME="idx759"></a>,
which lets you control what the module gets called. The arguments to
this are the name to give the module in your namespace, and the three
return values from the previous function. This returns a module
object you can manipulate further:</P>



<PrE ClASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; mymodule = imp.load_module('temp', found[0], found[1], found[2])
&gt;&gt;&gt; mymodule
&lt;module 'temp'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<p>If the module contains errors, it raises an exception, and the file
handle in <tt cLASS="monofont">found[0]</tt> is left open. Your code should
use a <tt CLASs="monofont">try</tt>... <tT CLAss="monofont">finally</tt>... block
that closes the file afterwards.</p>



<p>A module object is like any other Python object. Let's put this
one in the global namespace as usual:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; globals()['temp'] = mymodule
&gt;&gt;&gt; temp.func('blah')
'blahblah'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>You now have a module object in memory and can call its functions.</p>



<p>Armed with this knowledge, you can add a menu option to your script
editor to import a script and make sure it's available in the
right namespace for users: the dictionary
<TT CLASs="monofont">userNameSpace</TT> in <tT ClASS="monofont">COMBookSet</TT>. As
usual, expose a public method in <Tt claSS="monofont">COMBookSet</TT>:</p>

<P>Note that this takes the name from the filename and adds it to
<TT Class="monofont">userNameSpace</tt>. The VB script
<tt class="monofont">import</tt> command looks like the earlier one for
<tt clasS="monofont">execFile</TT>, but calls <TT ClASs="monofont">importFile</TT>
instead. Users can now edit scripts and choose both Script <iMG BORDer="0" alIGN="absmiddle" Width="20" HEIGht="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" ALT="figs/U2192.gif">

<H4>8.1.7
Providing a Startup Script</H4>


<P>
<A name="idx762"></A>
<A NAme="idx763"></a>A useful customization is to allow an
option for a startup script. The script could be a standard,
hardcoded filename or a configuration variable. Users can do almost
anything with this script; they can put in a series of standard
import statements, go off and import commonly used data files from
elsewhere, and (as we'll see) set up the
<tT CLAss="monofont">BookSet</tt> as they want with validation rules and
custom views. The script executes after the
<tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt> has been initialized, so it can't
control the way <tt class="monofont">BookSet</tT> initializes.</P>



<P>This feature is easy to provide with the tools we've just
built. In <A href="pythonwin32_snode63.html#19">Figure 8.3</A>, we've gone for a
user-defined script name in an Options dialog.</p>

<p>Earlier on we put two public methods in <tt class="monofont">frmMain</TT>
called
<TT CLaSS="monofont">InitCOMServer</tT>
<A nAME="idx764"></A> and
<TT clasS="monofont">CloseCOMServer</TT>
<A name="idx765"></A>, and never used the latter. Here
there's a good use for it. <TT Class="monofont">InitCOMServer</TT> has
been expanded as follows (ignoring error trapping to save space):</P>



<Pre class="monofont">Sub InitCOMServer()
    Dim startupScript As String
    
    'called when the program starts
    On Error GoTo InitCOMServer_error
    Set BookServer = CreateObject("Doubletalk.BookServer")
    On Error GoTo 0
    
    'tell it to capture output for the console
    BookServer.beginTrappingOutput
    
    'if there is an init script, run it
    If frmOptions.txtStartupScript.text &lt;&gt; "" Then
        On Error GoTo InitCOMServer_StartupScriptError
        BookServer.execFile frmOptions.txtStartupScript.text
        On Error GoTo 0
    End If
    
    'grab any standard output for the console
    frmConsole.UpdateOutput
    Exit Sub</pre>


<p>Test to see if there is a startup script and run it under an error
handler if there is. Then tell the console to fetch any standard
output.</p>



<p>We've also provided a button titled Reload BookServer Now. This
one just shuts down and restarts the server (losing any running
data):</p>



<pre clasS="monofont">Private Sub cmdReload_Click()
    Dim Proceed As Boolean
    If frmMain.BookServer.count &gt; 0 Then
        If MsgBox("You have data in the BookServer which will be " + _
          "lost. Proceed?", vbOKCancel, "Warning") = vbCancel Then
            Exit Sub
        End If
    End If
    frmConsole.Clear
    frmMain.CloseCOMServer
    frmMain.InitCOMServer  'this calls the script
    frmMain.UpdateAllViews
    Beep
    
End Sub</PRE>


<P>The user now has a startup script that allows almost limitless
customization. We haven't implemented a place to save this
script; the choices are generally the registry or an INI file.</P>

<h4>8.1.8
Defining User and System-Code Directories</h4>


<p>
<a nAME="idx769"></A>
<A NaME="idx770"></a>This section doesn't discuss a
feature, it's just a recommendation. Your application and
documentation should define clearly where the main source package
lives (e.g., <I>C:\Program Files\Doubletalk\Source</I>)
and where users' code should go (e.g., <i>C:\Program
Files\Doubletalk\UserSource</I>). The application should add
the latter directory to the path when starting, and suggest it as the
default location for any user scripts if you provide a
<A NAME="idx771"></a>script editor.<a naME="idx772"></A></P>
