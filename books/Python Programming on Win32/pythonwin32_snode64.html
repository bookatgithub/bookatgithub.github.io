<h3>8.2
Making an Application Extensible</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx773"></a> <a naME="idx774"></A>We've built all the tools you
need to provide the user with a macro language. We'll now look
at ways to let users extend the object model. Exactly what you choose
to make extensible depends a great deal on the application.</P>



<p>In the case of the Doubletalk browser, we'd like to add two new
capabilities. We want to trap certain events occurring in the
<tt cLASS="monofont">BookSet</tt> and allow users to write code to respond,
and we'd like to let users write their own views.</p>



<p>Bear in mind that from now on we are talking about
<a name="idx775"></a>
<a name="idx776"></a>power
users, who are presumed to have some programming experience or at
least aptitude. With a well-documented object model, their task
should be easier in Python than in other languages; but they still
have the ability to create bugs and damage data. We'll try to
structure the application in a way that keeps users away from
critical <a name="idx777"></A>
<A NAME="idx778"></a>code and keeps it simple.</P>




<H4>8.2.1
Changing the Delegate Class</h4>


<P>
<A nAmE="idx779"></A>It's useful to specify in another
option what class to use in the place of the
<TT clasS="monofont">BookSet</TT>. Imagine variations of
<Tt claSS="monofont">BookSet</TT> that fetch data from a relational database
and commit each record as it's edited, or that perform some
degree of caching to answer certain queries quickly.</p>



<p>Changing the base class involves a lot of development and testing and
is not easy to do on the fly. However, it's possible to arrange
things so that a user-written module is consulted to determine the
delegate class at startup.</p>



<p>If you distribute your core application as source, the users can
always create a subclass to do what they want. However, subclassing
involves a lot of work; users must ensure that their new
<TT CLass="monofont">BookSet</tt><i> </i>subclass still does
everything the <tt class="monofont">COMBookSet</tt><i>
</i>class expects. While possible, this pattern is not really
recommended for a complex class like <tt cLASS="monofont">BookSet</TT>.</p>







<H4>8.2.2
A Delegation Framework for Responding to Events</H4>


<p>There are four events in the <TT cLaSS="monofont">BookSet</TT> API that
allow modification: adding, editing, and deleting transactions, and
renaming accounts. For each of these, you should provide a hook
called before the event that gives the user a chance to modify the
data or cancel the action altogether and another hook called after
the event that allows the user to update other variables elsewhere.</p>



<p>Rather than have the user write numerous disconnected functions or
subclass the entire <tt CLASs="monofont">BookSet</tt>, you can use a pattern
known as a
<i>delegate</I>
<A NAme="idx780"></a>.
A delegate is a helper object a class informs of various events: it
delegates certain responsibilities. The delegation mechanism was a
cornerstone of the almost legendary <a NAME="idx781"></a>NeXTStep development environment
and is widely used behind the scenes in
<a name="idx782"></a> <a name="idx783"></a>Delphi,
where each component delegates the task of responding to events to
its parent form. A delegate is typically much simpler than the class
it's supporting. Users will find it far less work to write
their own delegates to achieve a task than to rewrite or subclass the
entire <tt class="monofont">BookSet</tT>.</P>







<H4>8.2.3
Views and Validators</H4>


<P>
<A nAMe="idx784"></A>
<A nAmE="idx785"></A>The
<A Name="idx786"></a>notifications before the event are
intended to validate data, and the notifications after the event can
maintain custom views. Accordingly, we define two types of delegate:</P>



<UL>
<Li><p>A <tt CLASs="monofont">Validator</tt> is an object a
<tT CLAss="monofont">BookSet</tt> notifies before changing data, asking for
permission to proceed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <tt class="monofont">View</tt> is an object the <tt CLASS="monofont">BookSet</Tt>
notifies after changes have been made.<FOnT SiZe="1"><SUP><A href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></SUP></font>
 It also has a method to return a 2D
array of data on demand, which contains whatever users wish.</P>


<BLOckquOTE><Font size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></SUP>
Design-pattern<I> </I>aficionados might also
argue that this is an instance of the observer pattern. Call it what
you will.</p>
</FOnT></BlOcKQUOte>


</li>
</UL>
<P>It was traditional until recently to have just one delegate for an
object. Some Java development environments allow a list of delegates
that can be added and removed at runtime, and we've borrowed
this pattern. We could also have built a more complex delegate that
combined the functions of <Tt claSS="monofont">Validator</TT> and
<tt clASS="monofont">View</Tt>, but this seemed a better fit to our goals
for the users.</p>



<p>For each delegate, youshould provide a base class users can subclass.
You should also define a subclass of <tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt> that
can use them. All this code can be found in the module
<tt class="monofont">doubletalk.userhooks</tt>
<A NAME="idx787"></A>, which also includes examples of
<tT ClASs="monofont">Validator</Tt>s and <TT CLass="monofont">View</tT>s.
Here's the definition of a <TT Class="monofont">View</TT>:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">class View:
    """This delegate is informed of all changes after they occur,
    and returns a 2d array of data when asked."""
    def setBookSet(self, aBookSet):
        self.BookSet = aBookSet
        self.recalc()

    def getDescription(self):
        return 'abstract base class for Views'
    
    # hooks for notification after the event
    def didAdd(self, aTransaction):
        pass
    def didEdit(self, index, newTransaction):
        pass
    def didRemove(self, index):
        pass
    def didRenameAccount(self, oldname, newname):
        pass
    def didChangeDrastically(self):
        #can be used to notify of major changes such as file/open
        self.recalc()
                
    def recalc(self):
        #override this to work out the data
        pass
    
    def getData(self):
        return [()]  # simple 2D array for display</Pre>
<a name="idx788"></a>
<a name="idx789"></a>
<a name="idx790"></a>
<a NAME="idx791"></A>
<A nAMe="idx792"></A>
<P>The <tT cLASS="monofont">View</tt> receives a <tt CLASs="monofont">SetBookset</tt>
call when hooked up, triggering a recalculation. At this point it
probably walks through the entire <tT CLAss="monofont">BookSet</tt>,
gathering the data it needs, in the same way the existing query
methods did in <TT CLass="monofont">BookSet</tt>.</p>



<p>The <tt class="monofont">View</tt> provides five notification methods for
the <tt claSS="monofont">BookSet</TT> to call with changes; the user
won't call these directly. Define the four changes identified
earlier and allow for one more
(<TT cLAsS="monofont">didChangeDrastically</Tt>) that can be called after,
for example, opening a new data file, which triggers a full
recalculation. These allow the <Tt CLASs="monofont">View</tt> to update its
data intelligently and efficiently in response to changes.</p>



<P><TT Class="monofont">Validator</TT>s look similar, but respond to calls such
as <TT clasS="monofont">self.mayAdd (transaction)</TT>. If the call returns
zero (<Tt class="monofont">false</tt>), the action is rejected.
<tt class="monofont">View</tt>s are just notified of changes and don't
have to return anything.</p>



<p>Let's look at our new <tt CLASS="monofont">UserBookSet</Tt><I>
</I>class, which knows what to do with
<tT ClAsS="monofont">View</TT>s and <Tt claSS="monofont">Validator</TT>s.
Here's how to initialize it, add <tt clASS="monofont">View</Tt>s, and
fetch their data later:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">class UserBookSet(BookSet):
    def __init__(self):
        BookSet.__init__(self)
        self.validators = []
        self.validator_lookup = {}
        self.views = []
        self.view_lookup = {}

    def listDelegates(self):
        # utility to tell us what's hooked up
        [details omitted to save space]
    
    def addView(self, aView):
        #put it in both a list and a dictionary
        # join them together
        self.views.append(aView)
        self.view_lookup[aName] = aView
        aView.setBookSet(self)

    def getViewData(self, aName):
        return self.view_lookup[aName].getData()</pre>


<p><tt class="monofont">View</tt>s are added with a name the user specifies.
The <tt clasS="monofont">View</TT> goes in both a list and a dictionary,
allowing you to iterate over the list of <TT ClASs="monofont">View</TT>s and
to quickly access individual <tT cLASS="monofont">View</tt>s by name. You
can then ask the <tt CLASs="monofont">UserBookSet</tt> to return the data
for any of its <tT CLAss="monofont">View</tt>s. There is a broadly similar
method to add a <TT CLass="monofont">Validator</tt>.</p>



<p>Now we'll override the methods of <tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt>
that may modify data. Here's the new method in
<tt claSS="monofont">UserBookSet</TT> to add a transaction:</P>



<PrE ClASs="monofont">def add(self, tran):
    for v in self.validators:
        if not v.mayAdd(tran):
            # rejected, stop
            return
            
    #call the inherited method
    BookSet.add(self, tran)

    # notify them all
    for v in self.views:
        v.didAdd(tran)</PrE>


<P>This code says, "Ask all the loaded
<TT clasS="monofont">Validator</TT>s for permission before adding the
transaction to the <Tt claSS="monofont">BookSet</TT>. Then after adding it,
tell each <tt clASS="monofont">View</Tt>." Similar methods have been
written for <tt class="monofont">edit</tt>, <tt class="monofont">remove</tt>, and
<tt CLASS="monofont">renameAccount</Tt>.</P>



<P>Finally, if you want to commit to this new architecture, change the
<tT ClAsS="monofont">__init__</TT> method for
<Tt claSS="monofont">COMBookSet</TT> to create a
<tt clASS="monofont">UserBookSet</Tt> instead of a
<tt cLASS="monofont">BookSet</tt>.</p>







<h4>8.2.4
A User-Defined View: The Backend</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx793"></a>Now
we can write a new <tt class="monofont">View</tt>, a simple one that keeps
track of the month-end balances of an account. The array has two
columns; the first entry to show year and month, and the second the
month-end balance. For a two-year data file, you thus get back about
24 rows:</P>



<PRE CLaSS="monofont">class MonthlyAccountActivity(View):
    """Keeps track of activity in an account.  Does
    smart recalculations."""
    
    def __init__(self, anAccount):
        self.account = anAccount
        self.balances = doubletalk.datastruct.NumDict()
    
    def getDescription(self):
        return 'Month end balances for ' + self.account
    
    def didAdd(self, tran):
        effect = tran.effectOn(self.account)
        if effect == 0:
            return
        else:
            #year and month as the key
            yymm = time.gmtime(tran.date)[0:2]
            self.balances.inc(yymm, effect)
            print 'added %s, %0.2f' % (yymm, effect)
    
    def didRemove(self, index):
        tran = self.BookSet[index]
        self.didAdd(-tran)   #invert and add
    
    def didEdit(self, index, newTran):
        oldTran = self.BookSet[index]
        self.didAdd(-oldTran)
        self.didAdd(newTran)
    
    def didChangeDrastically(self):
        self.recalc()
        
    def recalc(self):
        "Do it all quickly in one pass"    
        self.balances.clear()
        for tran in self.BookSet:
            yymm = time.gmtime(tran.date)[0:2]
            for (acct, amount, etc) in tran.lines:
                if acct == self.account:
                    self.balances.inc(yymm, amount)
    
    def getData(self):
        # numdict returns it all sorted; just need to format
        # the date column
        formatted = []
        for (period, balance) in self.balances.items():
            (year, month) = period  #unpack tuple...
            monthname = doubletalk.dates.SHORT_MONTHS[month-1]
            displayDate = monthname + '-'  + str(year)
            formatted.append((displayDate,balance))
        return formatted</pRE>


<p>This should be fairly straightforward for users to produce. The
<Tt CLASs="monofont">recalc()</tt> method works it all out in five lines,
using the <tT CLAss="monofont">NumDict</tt>
<A NAMe="idx794"></a><i> </i>utility
class to categorize the numbers. When a single transaction is added,
<TT CLass="monofont">recalc()</tt> tests if the transaction affects the
account; if not, no work is needed. If so, it just changes one entry
in the <tt class="monofont">NumDict</tt>.The methods for the other events
are repetitive but similar. When the user requests the data from the
GUI, the only work needed is to retrieve and sort a list of 24 items,
which should happen almost instantaneously.</p>



<p><i>userhooks.py</i>
<a naME="idx795"></A> contains a test routine that can be called
from a Python console to verify that the
<TT ClASs="monofont">UserBookSet</TT> and <tT cLASS="monofont">View</tt> are
working correctly.</p>







<h4>8.2.5
A User-Defined View: The Front End</H4>


<P>Now how do you look at <TT clasS="monofont">View</TT> in the interface? Once
again, you need to extend <Tt claSS="monofont">COMBookSet</TT>. First,
change its initializer so that it creates a
<tt class="monofont">UserBookSet</tt> instead of a
<tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt><i>.</i> Second, expose a
method called
<tT CLASS="monofont">getViewData()</tT>
<A nAMe="idx796"></A> that calls the underlying method of
<tT CLAss="monofont">BookSet</tt>. It's easiest to create and add the
<TT CLass="monofont">View</tT> with a short chunk of Python script:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">from doubletalk.userhooks import MonthlyAccountActivity
view = MonthlyAccountActivity('MyCo.Assets.NCA.CurAss.Cash')
TheBookSet.addView(v, 'CashBalances')</PRe>


<p>The Rolls Royce approach would be to build this on the fly after
letting users select view types and parameters from a menu; however,
this means having some sort of configuration dialog for each
<tt class="monofont">View</tt>. At a more basic level, power users writing
their own <tt class="monofont">View</tt>s could write this code themselves
and put it in a start-up script.</p>



<P>Having done this, all you have to do is build a generic form with a
grid. This keeps track of its name and fetches the
<TT CLAsS="monofont">View</Tt> data (and a description) when asked. The next
section presents a user-defined <TT cLaSS="monofont">View</TT> of the
monthly cash balances. See <a href="pythonwin32_snode64.html#11">Figure 8.4</A>.<A Name="idx797"></a></P>

<h4>8.2.6
User-Defined Validations</H4>


<P>
<A Name="idx798"></a>Imagine you're building a set
of year-end accounts, repeatedly importing data from several sources
and making manual edits. It all has to be perfect, and it's
2:00 a.m. You think you have the first half of the year sorted out
and accidentally enter a transaction dated October 1998 instead of
October 1999. It doesn't show up in the <TT CLass="monofont">View</tT>
you are looking at, so you enter it again and make other corrections
elsewhere based on your erroneous account balances. If you are
unlucky, you could waste hours finding the error and unravelling all
the dependent changes (One author knows this all too well). The
<I>userhooks</I> file also defines a sample
<Tt claSS="monofont">Validator</TT> that puts a <a name="idx799"></a>time lock on the
<tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt>; this prevents any changes before a cutoff
date. Here's the code:</p>



<pre clASS="monofont">class DateWindowValidator(Validator):
    """An example.  Prevents changes on or before a certain date
    locking the bookset"""

    def __init__(self, aDescription, aDate):
        Validator.__init__(self, aDescription)
        self.cutoff = aDate
    
    def mayAdd(self, aTransaction):
        return (aTransaction.date &gt; self.cutoff)
    
    def mayEdit(self, index, newTransaction):
        oldtran = self.BookSet[index]
        if oldtran.date &lt;= self.cutoff:
            return 0
        elif newTransaction.date &lt;= self.cutoff:
            return 0
        else:
            return 1

    def mayRemove(self, index):
        tran = self.BookSet[index]
        return (tran.date &gt; self.cutoff)
        
    # renameAccount will not break anything</PRE>


<p>More sophisticated <TT cLAsS="monofont">Validator</tT>s might have beginning
and ending time windows, a list of accounts not to touch, or even a
user-related permissions mechanism. All these can be implemented
without the users needing to touch the core
<TT Class="monofont">BookSet</TT> code.<A Name="idx800"></a> <A NAMe="idx801"></a></p>







<h4>8.2.7
More Ways to Extend the Application</H4>


<P><TT class="monofont">View</tt>s and <tt class="monofont">Validator</tt>s can be
used for other jobs as well as displaying interactive data:</p>



<ul>
<li><P>If you want to implement an <A NAME="idx802"></a>error-recovery system, you could create
a <TT cLAsS="monofont">View</tT> that writes every change to a log file and
then can roll backward and forward through the log (edits are
reversible; renaming is not). This provides a full audit trail,
invaluable when making lots of minor corrections at year-end.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>If the system were holding real data (e.g., as part of an executive
information system), you could build a system of
<a NAME="idx803"></a>alerts to
warn people or generate certain reports if accounts fell below
certain levels, or if creditors were more than a certain amount of
time overdue.</p>
</li>
</UL>






<H4>8.2.8
A Note on Performance</H4>


<p>
<a naME="idx804"></A>Extending
<Tt class="monofont">BookSet</tt> to <tt class="monofont">UserBookSet</tt> and
adding in <tt clASS="monofont">View</TT>s and <Tt CLaSS="monofont">Validator</tT>s
changes the performance characteristics enormously. If our goal is a
simple, general-purpose class around which to write scripts, it may
not be worth doing. The original <tT CLAss="monofont">BookSet</tt> can add,
edit, and remove transactions quickly as it keeps them in a list, but
most useful queries involve a loop over the entire set of data. A
running <TT CLass="monofont">UserBookSet</tT> in an interactive application
might have 10,000 transactions in memory, five
<TT Class="monofont">View</TT>s open, and two <TT class="monofont">Validator</tt>s.
This means that any addition involves talking to seven other objects,
and an edit involves 14 objects. Naturally, this dramatically slows
bulk operations. However, it dramatically enhances query performance;
a view on the screen displaying month-end balances of every account
might need to redraw only one or two cells of the grid after an edit,
rather than recalculate completely. Think of each running
<tt class="monofont">View</tt> as an extra database index, and you
won't go far wrong.<a name="idx805"></A> <A NAME="idx806"></a></P>
