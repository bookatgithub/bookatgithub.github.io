<h3>9.1
Client-Side COM and the Excel Object Model</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx812"></a>
<a naME="idx813"></A>Using Python for client-side COM
basically means using Python to access an application somebody else
has written. There is little to learn about client-side COM per se;
what matters is learning the object model of the application or
library you want to use.</P>



<p>Excel has a large object model—about as complex as anything you
are likely to encounter. For example, just one of the objects,
<tt cLASS="monofont">Range</tt>
<a name="idx814"></a>, has 84 properties and 72 methods.
What's more, it's not particularly straightforward; the
Perl community's mantra "There's more than one way
to do it" probably applies even more to Excel than it does to
Perl.</p>



<p>In <a href="pythonwin32_cnode55.html">Chapter 7</a>, we stressed the importance of
rerunning Office Setup to get the right help files. If you
didn't do it then, do it now. The key help file is
the<a name="idx815"></A> <A NAME="idx816"></a> <A NaME="idx817"></a>
<I>Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Reference</I>, which
covers the object model.</P>



<P>The easiest way to learn the Excel object model is to write programs
in Visual Basic for Applications. The <A Name="idx818"></a> <A NAMe="idx819"></a>VB editor is available with every copy
of Office and is a first-rate development environment. The following
key features help a great deal in learning:</p>



<a NAME="idx820"></a><dl>
<dT>
<I><FOnt color="#990000">Drop-down auto-completion</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a namE="idx820"></A>If you type
<TT CLaSS="monofont">ActiveSheet</tT> into the editor, a list drops down
showing all the properties and methods of a <Tt CLASS="monofont">Sheet</Tt>
object. This saves an enormous amount of time learning the object
model (see <a href="pythonwin32_snode68.html#3">Figure 9.1</A>).</P>

<dd>
<p>
<a name="idx821"></a>You can click on any variable, property,
or method name and press F1 to get detailed help on that part of the
object model. The help file also has a number of genuinely useful
topic guides.</p>

<dd>
<p>
<a NAME="idx822"></a>
<a naME="idx823"></A>You don't need to
write a whole program to get started in Excel. You can write a
subroutine in the editor, hit F5, and it runs. A great way to start
learning about ranges and selections is to write a short routine to
select some cells, and just keep running and extending it.</P>
</dd>
</dl>


<P>Having dispensed this piece of advice, we'll ignore it totally
and begin by getting at Excel from Python. Within Python, you
can't do any damage, but you need to know the objects and
methods required.</P>



<P>A one-time step, which isn't required but which makes things
faster and more pleasant to develop with, is to run the Python
<A name="idx824"></a>MakePy
utility. What this does is explained fully in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode91.html">Chapter 12</a><i>. </i>On the Tools menu,
choose COM Makepy utility, and select Microsoft
<a name="idx825"></a>Excel 8.0 Object Library from the list
box. This may take one or two minutes to run but needs to be done
only once per machine. This builds a support library of Python code
for accessing the Excel object model, which allows early- rather than
late-bound COM. Your code will run faster, and you'll know
which Office objects you are accessing. If you don't do this,
it all still works, but it uses a different technique behind the
scenes.</p>




<h4>9.1.1
Starting Excel</H4>


<P>
<A NAMe="idx826"></A>Start up PythonWin and
enter the following:</P>



<pRE cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; from win32com.client import Dispatch
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlApp = Dispatch("Excel.Application") 
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlApp.Visible = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlApp.Workbooks.Add()
&lt;win32com.gen_py.Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library.Workbook&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRe>


<p>There will be a few-second pause before Excel starts. You should see
Excel appear when you enter <tt CLASs="monofont">xlApp.Visible</tt>
<tT CLAss="monofont">=</tt> <TT CLass="monofont">1</tt>, but with an empty main
window; the final line creates a blank workbook with three sheets.
Note that the return value of <tt class="monofont">Add</tt><i>
</i>is informative. This is part of what Makepy does for you;
if you had not run it, you'd get a less informative string
back. By the way, we've made Excel visible for teaching
purposes; if you just want to manipulate data, keep it hidden and
save processor cycles.</p>







<h4>9.1.2
Navigating Through Collections</h4>


<p>
<a NAME="idx827"></A>The <A nAMe="idx828"></A>Excel object hierarchy basically
goes <Tt CLASS="monofont">Application</Tt>, <tt cLASS="monofont">Workbook</tt>,
<tt CLASs="monofont">Sheet</tt>, <tT CLAss="monofont">Range</tt>,
<tt class="monofont">Cell</tt>. A <tt class="monofont">Range</tT> is an arbitrary
region on a <TT CLAsS="monofont">Sheet</Tt>. You can assign variables to the
various items in the hierarchy or drill down in one long statement.
If you want to modify the top left cell of Sheet1 in our new
workbook, you can get to it in any of the following ways:</P>



<PrE CLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlApp.ActiveSheet.Cells(1,1).Value = 'Python Rules!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlApp.ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.Cells(1,1).Value = 'Python Rules!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlApp.Workbooks("Book1").Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(1,1).Value = "Python Rules!"
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlApp.Workbooks(1).Sheets(1).Cells(1,1).Value = "Python Rules!"  
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlApp.Workbooks(1).Sheets(1).Cells(1,1).Value = "Python Rules!"  
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlBook = xlApp.Workbooks(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet = xlApp.Sheets(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(1,1).Value = "Python Rules!"
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>We recommend getting a reference to the sheet you want and working
with that.</P>



<P>The last few examples illustrate a common feature of Microsoft object
models—their dependence on <I>collections</I>. A
collection can be viewed as a cross between a list and a dictionary;
it can be accessed by a numeric index or a named
<a namE="idx829"></A>string key.
Python allows you to access items via numeric indexes with both
a<A Name="idx830"></a>
function-call and an
<A NAMe="idx831"></a>array syntax: in other words, with
parentheses or square brackets. If you are using a string key, you
must use parentheses:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlBook.Sheets(1)
&lt;win32com.gen_py.Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library._Worksheet&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlBook.Sheets[1]
&lt;win32com.gen_py.Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library._Worksheet&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlBook.Sheets["Sheet1"]
# some error details omitted
TypeError: Only integer indexes are supported for enumerators
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>However, there is a trap to watch for. Collections can be written to
start indexing from one or from zero. If you are dealing with a
<a name="idx832"></a>
<A NAME="idx833"></A>one-based collection, you will get
different answers; using square brackets gives you the true position
in the collection, but parentheses gives the position according to
the numbering system chosen by the author of that collection:</p>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlBook.Sheets(1).Name
'Sheet1'
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlBook.Sheets[1].Name
'Sheet2'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<P>We recommend using parentheses throughout and relying on the object
model's documentation to find how the collections work. For
Microsoft Office applications, most collections start at 1.</p>







<h4>9.1.3
Keyword Arguments</h4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx834"></a>
<a nAME="idx835"></A>Both
Python and Excel support keyword arguments. These are generally used
when you have a long list of possible arguments to a function, most
of which have default values. Excel takes this to extremes; for
example, the function to save a workbook is:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">WorkBook.SaveAs(<tt class="monofont"><i>Filename</i></tt>, <tt class="monofont"><i>FileFormat</i></TT>, <TT CLaSS="monofont"><i>Password</I></Tt>, <TT CLASs="monofont"><i>WriteResPassword</i></tT>, <TT Class="monofont"><I>ReadOnlyRecommended</I></TT>, 
<tt clASS="monofont"><I>CreateBackup</i></tt>, <tt class="monofont"><i>AddToMru</i></tt>, <tt class="monofont"><I>TextCodePage</I></TT>, <TT cLAsS="monofont"><I>TextVisualLayout</i></TT>)</PRE>


<P>And that's a short one: some of the formatting commands have
literally dozens of arguments. To call these, you supply only the
arguments you want, as follows:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlBook.SaveAs(Filename='C:\\temp\\mysheet.xls')
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<P>The capitalization of the keywords must be exactly right. Microsoft
generally uses mixed case for everything but
<TT Class="monofont">Filename</TT>, but you'll undoubtedly have a fun
time discovering more exceptions.</P>







<H4>9.1.4
Passing Data In and Out</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx836"></a>
<a name="idx837"></a>We
put data into a cell with the
<tt class="monofont">Value</TT>
<A NAMe="idx838"></A><I> </i>property of a
cell. We can also retrieve data the same way. This works with numbers
and strings. Excel always stores numbers as floating-point values:</P>



<PrE CLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(1,1).Value = 'What shall be the number of thy counting?'
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(2,1).Value = 3 
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(1,1).Value
'What shall be the number of thy counting?'
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(2,1).Value
3.0
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx839"></a>Excel users know that dates are just
numbers with formatting applied. However, Excel keeps track of which
cells are known to be dates and which are ordinary numbers
internally. Excel (and most Windows applications, as well as COM)
define a date as the number of days since 1/1/1900, while Python (and
Unix) counts the number of seconds. If you want to add a date, you
can work out the number yourself, but the Python COM framework
provides a utility to make a COM date, which ensures that it's
recognized properly but also accessible in Python format:</p>



<pRE CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; now = time.time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; now    # how many seconds since 1970?
923611182.35
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pythoncom
&gt;&gt;&gt; time_object = pythoncom.MakeTime(now)
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(time_object)   # can get the value back...
923611182
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(3,1).Value = time_object # ...or send it
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(3,1).Value
&lt;time object at 188c080&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pRE>


<P>When you send a date to Excel, it automatically formats the cell as
well.</P>



<p>If you want to insert a formula, use the
<tt class="monofont">formula</tt>
<a name="idx840"></a> property and enter the formula exactly
as you would in Excel:</p>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(4,1).Formula = '=A2*2'
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(4,1).Value
6.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(4,1).Formula
'=A2*2'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRe>


<P>Finally, empty cells are represented by the Python value
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">None</TT>
<A Name="idx841"></a>:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(1,1).Value = None  # clear a cell
&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Cells(1,1).Value  # returns None
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>






<h4>9.1.5
Accessing Ranges</h4>


<p>
<a NAME="idx842"></a>We've been calling the
<tt class="monofont">Value</tt>
<a name="idx843"></a> <a name="idx844"></A> and <TT CLAsS="monofont">Formula</Tt> methods
without really knowing what they refer to. They are methods of an
object called a <TT cLASS="monofont">Range</TT>
<a namE="idx845"></A>, which refers to a range of
cells. You can use <TT clasS="monofont">Ranges</TT> to get hold of regions
of a spreadsheet in several ways:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; myRange1 = xlSheet.Cells(4,1)       # one-cell range
&gt;&gt;&gt; myRange2 = xlSheet.Range("B5:C10")  # excel notation
&gt;&gt;&gt; myRange3 = xlSheet.Range(xlSheet.Cells(2,2), xlSheet.Cells(3,8))
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>A sheet has a <tt class="monofont">Range()</tt>
<a name="idx846"></a> method that returns a
<tt CLASS="monofont">Range</Tt> object. The <TT cLAsS="monofont">Range</TT> method
can accept the usual Excel notation or a pair of one-cell
<TT Class="monofont">Range</TT> objects defining the top left and bottom
right. You can even perform intersections and unions to build
nonrectangular ranges. Once you have a <TT clasS="monofont">Range</TT>
object, as mentioned earlier, you have 84 methods and 72 properties
to play with. These cover all the formatting options including data.</P>







<h4>9.1.6
Arrays</h4>


<p>
<a NAME="idx847"></a>
<a name="idx848"></a>In <a href="pythonwin32_cnode55.html">Chapter 7</a> we
built a view of an account. To do this, we fetched a 2D array of data
from Python and looped over it, putting one number at a time into a
grid. When we first started playing with Python and Excel, we
expected to have to do something similar. Not so! Ask a range for its
value, and you get an array. You can set the value of a range to an
array, too. At this point we've typed a few more items into our
spreadsheet to refer to (see <a href="pythonwin32_snode68.html#10">Figure 9.2</a>).</p>



<cENTER>
<H5>
<a NAmE="10"></A>Figure 9.2. Passing arrays between Python and Excel</h5>

<IMG BORder="0" wIDTH="502" heigHT="280" src="FILES/ppw.0902.gif" alt="figs/ppw.0902.gif"></CENTer>


<p>First, grab a horizontal array:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Range('C3:E3').Value
((L'left', L'to', L'right'),)
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Note that you get back Unicode strings, which you could convert to
Python with a <tt claSS="monofont">str()</TT> operation. When you asked for
a single cell value earlier, the Python COM framework was smart
enough to convert the Unicode string to a Python string; with a big
array, you have to do the work.</P>



<P>Now, for a matrix with several rows and columns:</p>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Range('C5:D7').Value
((L'North', L'South'), (100.0, 200.0), (300.0, 400.0))
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<P>This returns a tuple of tuples, exactly the natural representation
you would choose in Python. (For the rest of this section we use the
term <i>array</i> to mean a Python structure of this
shape—a <a nAME="idx849"></A>
<a namE="idx850"></A>list of lists, tuple of tuples, or list
of tuples.) Finally, look at a vertical row, taking the items in
column F:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xlSheet.Range('F2:F4').Value
((1.0,), (2.0,), (3.0,))
&gt;&gt;&gt;</Pre>


<p>As before, you get a tuple of tuples.</p>



<p>You may be wondering what those extra commas are inside the
parentheses. They are Python's way of marking a one-element
<a name="idx851"></a>tuple.
The expressions <tt class="monofont">2</tt>, <tT CLASS="monofont">(2)</tT>, and
<Tt CLaSS="monofont">((((2)))</TT> all evaluate to 2 in Python, as you would
expect from the use of parentheses in mathematical formulae in any
language. The comma tells Python it's looking at a
<A Name="idx852"></a> <A NAMe="idx853"></a>one-element tuple rather than
an expression to simplify.</p>



<p>Passing arrays between Excel and Python is fast. We tried passing a
matrix with 100 rows and 100 columns on a Pentium 266. Sending it to
Excel took 1.7 seconds; fetching back the same amount of data took
just 0.07 seconds.<A NAMe="idx854"></a> <a nAME="idx855"></A></p>
