<h3>9.3
Putting It All Together: Importing Financial Data</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx866"></a> <a naME="idx867"></A>Now we'll write an import script
using our wrapper. Excel is a good medium for entering financial
data; users can enter data more quickly in Excel than in a database;
Excel builds pick lists automatically; and it's easy to copy,
paste, and rearrange the data quickly. However, data entered in this
way isn't always properly validated. Imagine that someone in
your organization is preparing a list of new invoices raised once a
month and emailing the data in a standardized spreadsheet. You want
to import it, validate it, get the data into double-entry format, and
save it in a <Tt claSS="monofont">BookSet</TT>, as part of assembling
monthly management accounts. The examples for this chapter include a
spreadsheet called <i>invoices.xls</i>, which looks
like <a href="pythonwin32_snode70.html#3">Figure 9.3</a>.</p>

<P>You want to open this up, grab the three facts near the top, and
import the matrix of cells describing the invoices. You're not
sure how many invoices to expect, so you need to count down. If
it's a cash sale (i.e., Date Raised is the same as Date Paid),
create one transaction; otherwise create two: one for the bill and
one for the payment. Note that some invoices are not yet paid; in
this case, estimate a payment date for your forecasts and tag it as a
scheduled transaction so that it can be filtered out of real
accounts.</p>



<p>The full script to do this is in the file <i>exceldemos.py,
</i>
<A NAMe="idx868"></a>which
you can find at <a name="idx869"></a> <a name="idx870"></a> <a name="idx871"></a><a TARGET="_blank" hREf="http://../starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/ppw32/default.htm">http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/ppw32/</A>.
Using the wrapper class, it becomes easy to acquire the desired data:</P>



<pRe CLASs="monofont">def getInvoices():
    # the demo - get some data from a spreadsheet, parse it, make
    # transactions, save
    
    # step 1 - acquire the data
    spr = easyExcel('Invoices.xls')

    MonthEnd = int(spr.getCell('Sheet1', 3, 2))
    PreparedBy = spr.getCell('Sheet1', 4, 2)
    Submitted = int(spr.getCell('Sheet1', 5, 2))
    print 'Month end %s, prepared by %s, submitted %s' % (
                    time.ctime(MonthEnd), 
                    PreparedBy,
                    time.ctime(Submitted)
                    )
     
    # do not know how many rows
    rawInvoices = spr.getContiguousRange('Sheet1',8,1)
    rows = spr.fixStringsAndDates(rawInvoices)</pre>


<P>
<A NAme="idx872"></a>We've
extracted the needed data and cleaned it up in just a few lines.
Logically, the next stage is to validate the data. You could go a
long way with this, but let's just check that the main table is
in the correct place and hasn't been rearranged:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">    # check correct columns
    assert rows[0] == ('Invoice No', 'Date Raised', 
        'Customer', 'Comment', 'Category', 
        'Amount', 'Terms', 'Date Paid'
         ), 'Column structure is wrong!'
    print '%d invoices found, processing' % len(rows)</PRE>


<P>The data looks fine; now all you have to do is build the transactions
you want:</p>



<pre class="monofont">    # make a BookSet to hold the data
    bs = BookSet()

    # process the rows after the headings
    for row in rows[1:]:
         # unpack it into separate variables
        (invno, date, customer, comment, 
        category, fmt_amount, terms, datepaid) = row

        # amounts formatted as currency may be returned as strings
        amount = string.atof(fmt_amount)
    
        if date == datepaid:
            # cash payment, only one transaction
            tran = Transaction()
            tran.date = date
            tran.comment = 'Invoiced - ' + comment
            tran.customer = customer
            tran.invoiceNo = invno
            tran.addLine('MyCo.Capital.PL.Income.' + category, - amount)
            tran.addLine('MyCo.Assets.NCA.CurAss.Cash', amount)
            bs.add(tran)

        else:
            # need to create an invoice and a (possibly future) payment
            # first the bill
            tran = Transaction()
            tran.date = date
            tran.comment = 'Invoiced - ' + comment
            tran.customer = customer
            tran.invoiceNo = invno
            tran.addLine('MyCo.Capital.PL.Income.' + category, - amount)
            tran.addLine('MyCo.Assets.NCA.CurAss.Creditors', amount)
            bs.add(tran)
 
            # now the payment.  If not paid, use the terms to estimate a
            # date, and flag it as a Scheduled transaction (i.e., not real)
            tran = Transaction()
            if datepaid == None:
                datepaid = date + (terms * 86400)
                tran.mode = 'Scheduled'    # tag it as not real
            tran.date = date
            tran.comment = 'Invoice Paid - ' + comment
            tran.customer = customer
            tran.invoiceNo = invno
            tran.addLine('MyCo.Assets.NCA.CurAss.Creditors', - amount)
            tran.addLine('MyCo.Assets.NCA.CurAss.Cash', amount)
            bs.add(tran)
 
    # we're done, save and pack up
    filename = 'invoices.dtj'
    bs.save(filename)
    print 'Saved in file', filename
    spr.close()</pre>


<p>Although the code is fairly lengthy, most of it is transferring a
field at a time from the input to the relevant field or line of a
transaction. If you define classes to represent invoices and
payments, each with a standard set of attributes and the right
constructors, this is simplified even further.<a name="idx873"></a> <a nAME="idx874"></A></P>
