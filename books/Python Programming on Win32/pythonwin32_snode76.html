<h3>10.1
Business Requirements</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx889"></a>Doubletalk's obvious goal
is to produce a complete set of management accounts. These will
almost certainly include company logos, repeating page headers and
footers, several different text styles, and charts and tables.</p>



<p>It would be highly desirable to view the output onscreen and keep it
in files. This makes for a faster development cycle than running off
to the printer and means you can email a draft to the marketing
department for approval or email the output to your customers.</p>



<P>Most important, it should be possible for users (sophisticated ones,
at least) to customize the reports. Everyone in business needs custom
reports. Companies who buy large client/server systems often have to
invest time and training in learning to use a report-design tool.
Systems that don't allow custom reporting either fail to give
their customers what they need, or (with better marketing) generate
large revenues for the consulting divisions of their software houses
to do things the customer could have expected for free.</P>



<P>If we can find a general solution that works from Python, the users
are automatically in charge of the system and can write their own
report scripts. This is a compelling selling point for a commercial
application.</P>




<h4>10.1.1
Different Document Models</h4>


<p>
<a NAME="idx890"></a>There are
several different document models you might wish to support. They all
end up as ink on paper, but suggest different APIs and tools for the
people writing the reports:</p>



<a name="idx891"></a><a name="idx892"></a><a name="idx893"></a><a NAME="idx894"></A><A nAMe="idx895"></A><Dl>
<DT>
<I><FONt colOR="#990000">Graphics programming model</FOnt></i></dT>
<DD>
<P>
<a namE="idx891"></A>The report designer writes programs to
precisely position every element on the page.</P>
</Dd>
<dt>
<i><font color="#990000">Word-processor model</font></i></dt>
<dD>
<P>
<A NAMe="idx892"></A>Elements flow down the page and onto the
next. There may be some sort of header and footer that can change
from section to section. Tables need to be broken intelligently, with
repeating page headers and footers.</P>
</dD>
<Dt>
<I><FONT Color="#990000">Spreadsheet model</FONT></i></dt>
<dD>
<P>
<A Name="idx893"></a>A grid underlies the page, and this can
produce sophisticated table effects. However, it starts to cause
problems if you want more than one table on a page with different
column structures.</P>
</DD>
<Dt>
<i><font color="#990000">Database form model</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>
<A NAME="idx894"></A>The same
form is repeated many times with varying data, possibly covering an
invoice run, a mailmerge, or bank statements for customers. Forms can
exceed one page and include master-detail records and group headers
and footers.</p>
</DD>
<dT>
<I><fONT COLor="#990000">Desktop-publishing model</foNT></I></Dt>
<dd>
<p>
<A NAMe="idx895"></a>This is the most sophisticated document
model in common use: the user specifies certain page templates and
may have many pages of a given template. Within pages, there are
frames within which objects can flow, and frames can be linked to
successors.</p>
</dD>
</DL>


<P>You need to keep your options open; don't expect all these to
be provided, but look for technologies that can be adapted to a
different model for a different project.</p>







<h4>10.1.2
Methodologies and Lessons from Experience</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx896"></a>We've been involved with several
different reporting systems over the last few years, and all have had
their shortcomings. It is instructive to run through some of their
lessons.</p>



<p>Project A involved a database of packaging designs, which could be
understood only with diagrams showing the box designs laid out flat
and semifolded. Reporting was left until the last minute because the
developers were not really interested; when time and budget pressures
arose, customers got something very unsatisfactory thrown together
with a database reporting tool. They were told that the tools just
did not support the graphics and layout they really wanted. This
situation is all too common.</p>



<p>Project B involved extracting database data to produce 100-page
medical statistical analyses; the reports were examples of a
word-processor model and could include numerous multipage tables with
precise formatting. A collection of scripts assembled chunks of
<a name="idx897"></a>
<a NAME="idx898"></A>rich
text format (RTF) to build the document, inserting them into Word. It
became clear that Python was the right tool to extract and organize
all the data; however, RTF is complex to work with and isn't
really a page-description language.</P>



<p>Project C was a scientific application that captured and analyzed
data from a device and produced a family of reports, including charts
and statistical tables. The reports needed to be viewed onscreen and
printable. They were written using Windows graphics calls. Previewing
accurately is a pain in the neck to implement at first, but worth it
afterwards. It soon became clear that you could share subroutines to
produce all the common elements; thus, one routine did the customer
logo on all pages, and the same table routine could be used
throughout. Changes to a common element would be applied across the
whole family of reports with accuracy. It became clear that writing
graphics code was a powerful approach, well suited to object-oriented
development and reuse.</P>



<P>Project D involved a family of database reports produced using a
graphic report writer (similar to the Report function in Access). A
team of developers put these together. Although layout was initially
easy, making a global change to all the reports was a nightmare.
Furthermore, it became hard to know if calculations were done in the
database or the report formulae themselves, leading to maintenance
problems. Worst of all, testing involved going directly to the
printer; there was no way to capture the output and email it to a
colleague for scrutiny.</p>



<P>Project E used a dedicated scripting language that could import
fixed-width and delimited text files and that output in PostScript.
This was suited to high volumes of data, allowed code sharing between
reports, and generally worked extremely well. The language used did
not allow any kind of object-oriented programming, however, which
made it hard to build higher-level abstractions.</P>



<p>Looking at all these experiences, the ideal solution would seem to
have the following characteristics (apart from being written in
Python):</P>



<UL>
<LI><P>The Python script acquires the data from whatever sources it needs
(databases, object servers, flat files) and validates it.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>The Python script uses a library to generate a suitable output
format, preferably with all the right layout capabilities.</P>
</Li>
<li><p>The report library allows users to reuse elements of reports,
building up their own reusable functions and objects over time.</P>
</LI>
</Ul>






<h4>10.1.3
Output Formats</h4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx899"></a>Now
let's look at some of the possible output formats and APIs:</p>



<a name="idx900"></a><a name="idx901"></a><a name="idx902"></a><A NAME="idx903"></A><a NAmE="idx904"></A><a NAME="idx905"></A><A name="idx906"></A><A NAme="idx907"></a><a NAME="idx908"></a><a naME="idx909"></A><A name="idx910"></a><a name="idx911"></a><a name="idx912"></a><a namE="idx913"></A><A NAMe="idx914"></A><Dl>
<DT>
<i><FONT COlor="#990000">Word documents</fONT></I></dt>
<dd>
<P>
<A NAme="idx900"></a>Most Windows desktops run Word, and a
free Word viewer is available. It's easy to automate Word and
pump data into it, with good control over page appearance. As we will
see, you can do a lot of work with templates, separating the
programming from the graphic design. Unlike all other solutions
discussed, Word handles document flow for you. It isn't at all
portable, but Word documents allow the user to customize the output
by hand if needed.</p>
</DD>
<DT>
<i><font color="#990000">Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI)</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a NAME="idx901"></A> <A nAMe="idx902"></A> <A nAME="idx903"></A>Windows
provides a wide range of graphics functions that can output to a
screen or to a printer. Essentially the same code can be aimed at
both. This needs to be initiated differently for a multipage report
as opposed to a single view on screen. GDI calls involve drawing on
the page at precise locations; there is no concept of document flow.</P>
</Dd>
<dt>
<i><FONT coloR="#990000">PostScript</FONt></i></dt>
<DD>
<P>
<A name="idx904"></a>PostScript is a
page-description language with advanced capabilities. It is the
language of desktop publishing and has defined an imaging model that
most other graphics systems try to follow. PostScript files can be
sent directly to a wide variety of printers and viewed with free
software on most platforms. PostScript is quite readable and easy to
generate. This is a multiplatform solution, but it isn't
commonly used as an output format on Windows. PostScript can be
viewed with GhostView, a popular Open Source package, or converted to
PDF with Adobe's Distiller product.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><font color="#990000">Portable Document Format (PDF)</fONT></I></DT>
<dD>
<P>
<a NAmE="idx905"></A> <A NAMe="idx906"></a>PDF is an evolution of
PostScript aimed at online viewing; conceptually, it's
PostScript broken into page-sized chunks, with compression and
various internal optimizations for rapid viewing.
<a nAME="idx907"></A>Acrobat
Reader is freely and widely available for Windows and other systems,
and allows people to view and print PDF files. PostScript Level 3
allows PDF documents to be sent direct to PostScript printers. PDF is
much more complex than PostScript, but end users never need to look
at the internals.</p>
</dd>
<dT>
<I><FOnt coLOR="#990000">Excel documents</Font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a name="idx908"></a>For invoices and other business forms
and some financial reports, Excel offers a natural model. As
we've seen, data can be pumped into it fast, and excellent
charts can be generated in Excel itself. Care must be taken over the
page size and zoom to get a consistent look across multipage
documents, and there is little to help you with page breaking. Excel
is highly useful if users want to play with the numbers themselves.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i><FONT COlOR="#990000">HTML</fONt></I></DT>
<DD>
<P>
<a namE="idx909"></A>HTML is ubiquitous, and there are
great tools for generating it from Python. The latest web browsers do
a good job of printing it. However, it doesn't let you control
page breaking or specify headers and footers, and there are no
guarantees about how a web browser will print a page. As we will see
later in this chapter, there are ways to incorporate HTML into your
reports in other systems, which is an easy way to meet part of our
requirements.</P>
</Dd>
<dt>
<i><FONT coloR="#990000">SGML and XML</FONt></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a name="idx910"></a> <a name="idx911"></a>SGML
(Standard Generalized Markup Language) is a large and complex
language used for marking up text in the publishing industry. It is
well suited for the layout of a book, but not for precise graphics
work. It has enormous capabilities but is quite specialized, and
viewers are not widely available.</p>



<p>
<A NAME="idx912"></A> <a NAmE="idx913"></A>XML (Extensible Markup Language)
was derived from SGML and is touted by many as the Next Big Thing on
the Web—a possible successor to HTML and a foundation for
electronic commerce. Python offers superb tools for working with XML
data structures. It is a family of languages rather than a single one
and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with page layout.
The general concept is to describe the data ("this is a new
customer header record") and not the appearance ("this is
18 point Helvetica Bold"). Our feeling about XML is that (like
Python data structures) it's a great way to move data from
place to place, but it doesn't solve the problem of how to
format it.<fONT SIZe="1"><sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></suP></FONt>
 However, once we have a useful Python printing tool, it
could be put to work with some kind of style-sheet language to format
and print XML data.</p>


<blOCKQuote><font size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><A NAME="FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></sUP>
There is a web standard known as
<a NAmE="idx914"></A>Document Style and Semantics
Specification Language (DSSL) that provides a standard way to
describe documents. There is also a transformation language based on
Scheme that accepts arbitrary XML documents and applies formatting
rules to them. However, this language is limited to a flow model, and
tools are not yet widely available for working with it.</P>
</FONt></bloCKQUote>


</dD>
</DL>


<P>In general, these formats/APIs fall into three camps:</p>



<ul>
<lI><P>Windows GDI is a <A Name="idx915"></a>
<a name="idx916"></a>C-level graphics API involving
precise drawing on the page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Word and Excel are applications you can automate through COM to
generate the right documents. Naturally, they have to be present to
create and to view the documents.</p>
</li>
<li><P>The others, including PostScript and PDF, are
<A NAME="idx917"></a>file formats.
You can write pure Python class libraries to generate files in those
formats. Like the Windows API (which borrowed heavily from
PostScript), they offer precise page-layout control.</P>
</Li>
</UL>
<p>Let's begin by automating Microsoft Word. Later in the chapter,
we discuss Windows GDI, PostScript, and PDF, with a view to a unified
API for all three. We haven't done a full set of management
accounts for each, but we take them far enough that you can figure it
out yourself<A NAME="idx918"></A>.<a namE="idx919"></A></P>
