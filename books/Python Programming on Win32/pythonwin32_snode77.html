<h3>10.2
Automating Word</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx920"></a>
<a naME="idx921"></A>As noted
previously, Word is an appealing alternative for many reasons. It has
a powerful printing and formatting engine. It's on a lot of
desktops; indeed it may be a standard throughout your company. A free
Word viewer is also available from Microsoft. Finally, it's
possible to post-process a document written in Word; you can generate
a set of management accounts or a stack of letters, and users can add
annotations as they wish.</P>



<p>As discussed with Excel, there are two options: use Python to take
control of Word, or have Word VB grab data from Python and format it.
In <a href="pythonwin32_cnode66.html">Chapter 9</A>, we mentioned some guidelines for
choosing which application was on top. We've shown Python
automating Word for the following reasons:</P>



<ul>
<li><p>There is a good chance that report production would be an automated
step in the middle of the night; people won't be using Word as
an interactive query engine in the same way as Excel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Python excels at formatting text and getting data into the right
shape.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Word document model is easy to automate. We'll be adding
chunks to the end of a document, and the details can be wrapped
easily in reusable Python code.</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Reports change and evolve rapidly. It's easier to change a
generic Python script than customize a Python COM server with new
special-purpose methods.</P>
</LI>
</Ul>
<P>However, there's absolutely no technical barrier to doing it
the other way around, and that may work for you in some
circumstances.</P>



<p>As with Excel, make sure you have the Word VB reference installed to
document the object model, and install MakePy<I>
</I>support for the Word object model.</p>




<H4>10.2.1
A Simple Example</h4>


<P>Let's start with the simplest possible example:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">from win32com.client import Dispatch
MYDIR = 'c:\\data\\project\\oreilly\\examples\\ch12_print'

def simple():
    myWord = Dispatch('Word.Application')
    myWord.Visible = 1  # comment out for production
    
    myDoc = myWord.Documents.Add()
    myRange = myDoc.Range(0,0)
    myRange.InsertBefore('Hello from Python!')
    
    # uncomment these for a full script
    #myDoc.SaveAs(MYDIR + '\\python01.doc')
    #myDoc.PrintOut()
    #myDoc.Close()</PRe>


<p>
<a nAME="idx922"></A>When you execute this
function, Word starts, and your message is displayed. We've
commented out the lines at the bottom, but you can choose to print,
save, or close the document. It's fun to arrange the Python
console and Word side-by-side and watch your text appearing, and a
great way to learn the Word object model.</p>







<h4>10.2.2
Using a Template</h4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx923"></a>
<a name="idx924"></a>You
could hand-build a document and automate all the formatting, but that
would be tedious. Far better to use a Word template and just put in
what you need from your Python code. For the next example,
we've created a template called
<i>Pythonics.dot</i>. This has a fancy header, page
numbers, and borders. It could also contain section headings, a table
of contents, standard text, or whatever you want. Using a template is
a huge leap forward in productivity. <a href="pythonwin32_snode77.html#5">Figure 10.1</a>
shows ours.</p>



<centER>
<H5>
<A NAmE="5"></A>Figure 10.1. A Word template</h5>

<IMg BoRDER="0" widtH="502" HEIght="243" src="FILES/ppw.1001.gif" ALt="figs/ppw.1001.gif"></cenTER>


<P>More important, a template allows you to separate the software
development from the page layout. An artistically challenged
developer could provide a basic template with the required elements,
and turn it over to the marketing department to define the styles and
boilerplate text. If she also delivers a Python test script
containing example data, the marketing person can regularly test
whether the program still runs while he is modifying the template.</p>



<p>To create a
<a name="idx925"></a>document based on a template, you
need to modify only one line:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; myDoc = myWord.Documents.Add(template=MYDIR + '\\pythonics.dot')</pre>


<p>Note the use of keyword arguments. Many of the Office functions (like
<TT CLASs="monofont">Documents.Add</TT>) take literally dozens of arguments,
and entering them every time would be tedious. Fortunately, Python
also supports named arguments. However, you need to watch the
<a NAmE="idx926"></a>case: most Word arguments have
initial capitals.</P>







<H4>10.2.3
A Document Wrapper</H4>


<P>
<a namE="idx927"></A>
<A Name="idx928"></a>Word
offers too many choices for building a document: you can loop over a
document's contents, search for elements such as words or
paragraphs, and select any portion of the text to work with.
We'll assume you want to build a document in order from
beginning to end.</P>



<P>Let's start with a <A Name="idx929"></a>Python class to help automate the
production of documents. First we'll construct an object that
has a pointer to a Word document, then add the desired methods one at
a time. The class is called
<TT CLass="monofont">WordWrap</tt>
<a name="idx930"></a> and can be found in the module
<i>easyword.py</i>
<a name="idx931"></a>. Here are some of its methods:</p>



<pRE CLASs="monofont">class WordWrap:
    """Wrapper around Word 8 documents to make them easy to build.
    Has variables for the Applications, Document and Selection; 
    most methods add things at the end of the document"""
    def __init__(self, templatefile=None):
        self.wordApp = Dispatch('Word.Application')
        if templatefile == None:
            self.wordDoc = self.wordApp.Documents.Add()
        else:
            self.wordDoc = self.wordApp.Documents.Add(Template=templatefile)
        
        #set up the selection
        self.wordDoc.Range(0,0).Select()
        self.wordSel = self.wordApp.Selection
        #fetch the styles in the document - see below
        self.getStyleDictionary()
        
    def show(self):
        # convenience when developing
        self.wordApp.Visible = 1  

    def saveAs(self, filename):
        self.wordDoc.SaveAs(filename)
       
    def printout(self):
        self.wordDoc.PrintOut()

    def selectEnd(self):
        # ensures insertion point is at the end of the document
        self.wordSel.Collapse(0)
        # 0 is the constant wdCollapseEnd; don't want to depend
        # on makepy support.

    def addText(self, text):
        self.wordSel.InsertAfter(text)
        self.selectEnd()</PRe>


<P>You work with the
<Tt ClASS="monofont">Selection</Tt>
<a naME="idx932"></A> object, which provides several methods
for inserting text. When you call
<Tt claSS="monofont">Selection.InsertAfter(</TT><tt clASS="monofont"><I>text</i></tt><tt class="monofont">)</tt>,
the selection expands to include whatever you add; it also provides a
<tt class="monofont">Collapse</tt>
<A NAME="idx933"></A> method that can take various parameters;
the one you need,
<tT ClASs="monofont">wdCollapseEnd</Tt>
<A NAMe="idx934"></a>, happens to have a value of zero, and
collapses the <tt CLASs="monofont">Selection</tt> to an insertion point at
the end of whatever you've just inserted. If you are using
MakePy, you can access the constant by name; since this is the only
constant we'll use in this application, we looked up the value
and used it directly to produce a script that works on all PythonWin
installations.</p>







<H4>10.2.4
Adding Paragraphs and Styles</H4>


<P>
<A name="idx935"></A>
<A NAme="idx936"></a>
<a name="idx937"></a>You can explicitly
format text with precise font names and sizes by assigning them to
the many properties of the <tt class="monofont">Selection</tt> object, but
it is less work and a better design to use predefined styles.
It's far easier to change a style than to adjust 20 different
reporting scripts.</p>



<p>The first thing to do is add a paragraph in a named style. Word has
constants for all the standard styles. If you used MakePy to build
the support for Word, you could access the built-in styles like this:</p>



<PRE CLAsS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; from win32com.client import constants
&gt;&gt;&gt; mySelection.Style = constants.wdStyleHeading1
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PrE>


<P>Note that we set the <tT cLASS="monofont">Style</tt> property of the current
<tt CLASs="monofont">Range</tt> to the correct style constant. This
doesn't work if you use dynamic dispatch, or if you have your
own custom template with styles that aren't built into Word.
However, you can query a document at runtime. The following method
gets and keeps a list of all styles actually present in a document:</p>



<PRE Class="monofont">def getStyleList(self):
    # returns a dictionary of the styles in a document
    self.styles = []
    stylecount = self.wordDoc.Styles.Count
    for i in range(1, stylecount + 1):
        styleObject = self.wordDoc.Styles(i)
        self.styles.append(styleObject.NameLocal)</PRE>


<P>The <tt class="monofont">Style</tt> property of a <tt class="monofont">Range</tt>
or <tt cLASS="monofont">Selection</TT> in Word accepts either a constant or
a string value, so you might as well use the names. Here's a
useful method:</p>



<PRe CLaSs="monofont">def addStyledPara(self, text, stylename):
      if text[-1] &lt;&gt; '\n':
          text = text + '\n'</PRE>


<P>Let's try:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import easyword
&gt;&gt;&gt; w = easyword.WordWrap()
&gt;&gt;&gt; w.show()
&gt;&gt;&gt; w.addStyledPara('What I did on Holiday', 'Heading 1')
&gt;&gt;&gt; w.addStyledPara('blah ' * 50, 'Normal')
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<P>This should give you something that looks like <A href="pythonwin32_snode77.html#8">Figure 10.2</a>.</p>

<p>Our wrapper class and Word's style features combine to make it
easy to build a document.</p>







<H4>10.2.5
Tables</H4>


<P>
<A name="idx938"></A>
<A NAme="idx939"></a>Word tables are
sophisticated object hierarchies in their own right, and you can
manipulate them to any level of detail. However, there's also
an <tT CLAss="monofont">AutoFormat</tt>
<a name="idx940"></a> option for tables that works in a
similar way to styles. Here's the full declaration:</p>



<pre class="monofont">Table.AutoFormat(<tt CLASS="monofont"><I>Format</i></TT>, <tT ClAsS="monofont"><I>ApplyBorders</I></Tt>, <tt cLASS="monofont"><i>ApplyShading</i></tt>, <TT CLass="monofont"><i>ApplyFont</I></TT>, <Tt class="monofont"><i>ApplyColor</i></tt>,
<tt class="monofont"><i>ApplyHeadingRows</i></tt>, <TT CLASs="monofont"><I>ApplyLastRow</I></tT>, <Tt ClASS="monofont"><I>ApplyFirstColumn</i></tt>, <tT CLAss="monofont"><i>ApplyLastColumn</i></TT>, <TT clasS="monofont"><I>AutoFit</I></Tt>)</pre>


<p>All you have to do is insert a block of tab-delimited text with the
table contents, and call the method to convert text to a table, then
call the table's
<tt class="monofont">AutoFormat</tt>
<a name="idx941"></a> method. Fortunately, almost all the
arguments are optional:</p>



<PRE CLAsS="monofont">def addTable(self, table, styleid=None):
     # Takes a 'list of lists' of data.
     # first we format the text.  You might want to preformat
     # numbers with the right decimal places etc. first.
     textlines = []
     for row in table:
         textrow = map(str, row)   #convert to strings
         textline = string.join(textrow, '\t')
         textlines.append(textline)
     text = string.join(textlines, '\n')
  
     # add the text, which remains selected
     self.wordSel.InsertAfter(text)
  
     #convert to a table
     wordTable = self.wordSel.ConvertToTable(Separator='\t')
     #and format
     if styleid:
         wordTable.AutoFormat(Format=styleid)</PrE>


<P>Unfortunately, to specify a style, you need to supply a numeric
format constant instead of a name. If you are using MakePy, this is
easy; an alternate approach is to use Word's VB editor to look
up the constants. Be warned: some constants vary across different
language editions of Word.</p>



<P>Tables can be accessed through the
<tT CLAss="monofont">Document.Tables</tt>
<A NAMe="idx942"></a> collection.</p>







<h4>10.2.6
Adding a Chart</H4>


<P>
<A Name="idx943"></a>Adding a
chart proved quite a challenge. There's a promising-sounding
Microsoft <A NAMe="idx944"></a>Chart COM library, but it turned out
not to allow automation in the same way as Word and Excel. Finally we
decided to just make up an Excel chart, which is probably easier for
users as well. A spreadsheet and chart can be easily designed by
hand, and you can update the numbers, recalculate, and save using the
tools in <a href="pythonwin32_cnode66.html">Chapter 9</a>. However, the problem remained
of how to add a new object and position it correctly within the
document. The problem took us several hours to solve and into some
dark and surprising corners of Word's object model. Since the
same techniques apply to positioning any OLE object or even a bitmap
from a file, it's worth going over the objects in question.</p>



<p>A little reading of the Word help file turned up the
<tt class="monofont">Shapes</tt>
<a nAME="idx945"></A> collection, which claims to represent
all the nontext objects in the document: OLE objects, WordArt,
graphic files, text boxes, and Word drawing objects. The collection
has a number of <TT cLAsS="monofont">Add</Tt> methods, including one called
<Tt CLASs="monofont">AddOLEObject</tt>
<a NAME="idx946"></a>. <tt cLASS="monofont">AddOLEObject</tt> has a
multitude of arguments, but allows you to specify a class and a file;
thus
<tt CLASs="monofont">Document.Shapes.Add(ClassType='Excel.Chart',FileName='mychart.xls')</tt>
inserts the chart somewhere in the document and creates a new
<tt class="monofont">Shape</tt>
<a name="idx947"></a> object to refer to it. The
<tt cLASS="monofont">Shapes</TT> collection lives somewhere called the
<i>drawing</I>
<A nAMe="idx948"></A> <i>layer</I>, which floats
above each page and isn't part of the document. The
<TT Class="monofont">Shape</TT>
<A Name="idx949"></a> object has an
<TT CLass="monofont">Anchor</tT>
<A NAme="idx950"></a> property that should be set to a valid
range in the document, and it's then constrained to stay on the
same page as the first paragraph in that range. You then have to
choose a coordinate system with the
<tt class="monofont">RelativeHorizontalPosition</tt>
<a name="idx951"></a> and
<tt cLASS="monofont">RelativeVerticalPosition</TT>
<a NAmE="idx952"></A> properties, which say whether the
location is measured relative to the current page, column or
paragraph. Finally, you set the <tT cLASS="monofont">Left</tt> and
<tt CLASs="monofont">Top</tt> properties to define the location in the given
coordinate system.</p>



<P>We managed to write some VBA code to position charts using these
objects and properties, but found the behavior inconsistent. If
you've ever struggled to position a screen shot in a document
while it jumps around at random, imagine what it is like doing it in
code from another application! With a large shape, Word would decide
that the initial location or page was impossible before you had
finished setting properties and give different behavior from Python
and from VBA.<FONt sizE="1"><SUP><a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></sup></font>
</p>


<blockquOTE><FONt SIzE="1">
<P cLaSS="footnote">
<SUp><a naME="FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A></Sup>
We did get to the bottom of this. Word
is badly behaved in its use of two COM variant types that are used to
denote empty and missing arguments. This explained a number of other
obscure COM bugs. The fix is complex, so we've stuck with our
simple workaround.</p>
</fONT></BlockQUOTe>





<p>Finally we discovered the
<tt class="monofont">InlineShapes</tt>
<a name="idx953"></a> collection (not a name you
would look for) that filled the bill. An
<tt clASS="monofont">InlineShape</TT> is conceptually part of the document;
put it between two paragraphs, and it stays between them forever. The
arguments to its constructor didn't work as advertised; the
shapes always seemed to appear at the beginning of the document, but
it was possible to cut and paste them into position. The following
code finally did the job:</P>



<pRE cLAsS="monofont">def  addInlineExcelChart(self, filename, caption='', 
                 height=216, width=432):
    # adds a chart inline within the text, caption below.
    
    # add an InlineShape to the InlineShapes collection 
    #- could appear anywhere
    shape = self.wordDoc.InlineShapes.AddOLEObject(
        ClassType='Excel.Chart',
        FileName=filename
        )
    # set height and width in points
    shape.Height = height
    shape.Width = width
    
    # put it where we want
    shape.Range.Cut()

    self.wordSel.InsertAfter('chart will replace this')
    self.wordSel.Range.Paste()  # goes in selection
    self.addStyledPara(caption, 'Normal')</pRE>


<P>The same routine can be easily adapted to place bitmaps. If you have
a simpler solution, drop us a line!</P>







<h4>10.2.7
Putting It Together</h4>


<p>Now we can build a set of management accounts. The example
applications include a Word template, an Excel spreadsheet with a
prebuilt chart, and a test routine in
<i>easyword.py</I>. Thanks to helper methods, this is
simple:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">def test():
    outfilename = MYDIR + '\\pythonics_mgt_accounts.doc'
    
    w = WordWrap(MYDIR + '\\pythonics.dot')
    w.show()  # leave on screen for fun
    w.addStyledPara('Accounts for April', 'Title')
    
    #first some text
    w.addStyledPara("Chairman's Introduction", 'Heading 1')
    w.addStyledPara(randomText(), 'Normal')
    
    # now a table sections
    w.addStyledPara("Sales Figures for Year To Date", 'Heading 1')
    data = randomData()
    w.addTable(data, 37) # style wdTableStyleProfessional
    w.addText('\n\n')
    
    # finally a chart, on the first page of a ready-made spreadsheet
    w.addStyledPara("Cash Flow Projections", 'Heading 1')
    w.addInlineExcelChart(MYDIR + '\\wordchart.xls', 'Cash Flow Forecast')
       
    w.saveAs(outfilename)
    print 'saved in', outfilename</PRe>


<p>This runs visibly for fun, but would be much faster if kept
off-screen. It produces the document in <a href="pythonwin32_snode77.html#12">Figure 10.3</A>.</p>

<H4>10.2.8
Inserting HTML and Other Formats</h4>


<p>
<a nAME="idx954"></A>
<a namE="idx955"></A>Word
can import and export HTML. The following line inserts an entire file
into the current document:</P>



<Pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; wordSelection.InsertFile(MYDIR + '\\tutorial.html')
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Furthermore, some experiments revealed that you don't even need
a full HTML document, just tagged text saved with the extension HTML.</p>



<p>So if you want an easy way to pump large amounts of text into a Word
document, generate the HTML and insert it. Python has an excellent
package, <tt class="monofont">HTMLgen</tT><I>, </I>for
generating sophisticated markup from code. Word can import HTML
tables with reasonable success, and all of the standard HTML styles
are marked as styles in Word.</P>



<P>
<A nAMe="idx956"></A>These days there is a need to
produce both printed and online versions of documents. If you write
code to generate the HTML, and then import it into a smart Word
template with the right corporate header and footer, you have a
complete solution.</P>







<h4>10.2.9
Using Python COM Objects From Word</H4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx957"></a>There is another approach for
incorporating Word. You can use Python as the COM server and Word as
the client. We discussed the pros and cons of this approach with
Excel at the end of <a href="pythonwin32_cnode66.html">Chapter 9</A>; the same design
considerations apply.</p>



<p>Using Word as a client, use <a nAME="idx958"></A> <a namE="idx959"></A>Visual Basic for
Applications to initialize a Python server and fetch the data. The
most natural way to package this is to build a Word template that
includes the code and the desired document elements. When a new
document is created from the template, it connects to the Doubletalk
COM server we built earlier, instructs it to load the data, fetches
the tables of information it needs, and uses VBA code to place the
data into the document. This approach has two advantages:</P>



<Ul>
<li><p>VBA offers nice editing features like drop-down auto-completion,
helping you to learn the Word object model quickly. Debugging is also
easier (assuming you have separately tested your Python server, and
the Word object model is what is giving you trouble).</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can safely tie functions in your template to regions of text or
tables in your template without needing to be too generic. Data
preparation is Python's job; formatting is Word's.</p>
</li>
</ul>






<h4>10.2.10
The Last Word</h4>


<p>
<a naME="idx960"></A>Please note: Word is hard to work
with. Even if you plan to write a controlling program in Python, you
should sort the code you need in VBA and check that it all runs first
to save time. The manuals and the product itself are buggy in places.
It is also somewhat unstable during development; if you make lots of
COM calls that cause errors, it tends to crash frequently. Once the
code is correct, it seems to keep working without problems. Some
other Python users have worked with very large documents and reported
stability problems in making thousands of COM calls in a row while
creating large documents.</P>



<P>However, we do expect this situation to improve; Word 8.0 is the
first version with VBA, whereas people have been automating Excel in
real-time systems for years. Furthermore, we expect Word to handle
XML in the future, which will allow more options for pumping in lots
of data quickly.</P>



<p>In conclusion, you have the technology to do almost anything with
Word. However, it's a heavyweight solution. Whether it's
the right format for you depends on several factors:</P>
