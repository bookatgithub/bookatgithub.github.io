<h3>10.4
PIDDLE: A Python Graphics API</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx979"></a>
<a naME="idx980"></A>
<A name="idx981"></A>While working on this
book, we tried to create a printing system that could handle multiple
formats, including Windows and PDF. At the same time, several people
in the Python newsgroup felt that it was a real pity everyone was
using platform-specific code to draw charts and diagrams, and that it
should be possible to come up with a common API that covered several
output formats. A team of four—<A NAme="idx982"></a> <a name="idx983"></a> <a name="idx984"></a>Joe Strout, Magnus Hetland, Perry Stoll,
and Andy Robinson—developed a common API during the spring of
1999, and a number of backends and a test suite are available at
press time. This has produced some powerful printing solutions, which
we explore here.</p>



<p>The API is known as Plug-In Drawing, Does Little Else (PIDDLE) and is
available from <a namE="idx985"></A> <A NAMe="idx986"></A><A tARgEt="_blank" HREF="http://www.strout.net/python/piddle/default.htm">http://www.strout.net/python/piddle/</a>. The
package includes the basic API, test patterns, and as many backends
as are deemed stable. The basic API defines classes to represent
fonts and colors, and a base class called
<tt cLASS="monofont">Canvas</tt>
<a nAME="idx987"></A>, which exposes several drawing methods.
The base canvas doesn't produce any output and exists to define
an interface; specific backends implement a canvas to draw on the
relevant device or file format.</p>



<p>Let's quickly run through the main features of the PIDDLE API.</p>




<h4>10.4.1
Available Backends</H4>


<P>At the time of writing, <A Name="idx988"></a>backends are available for PDF, the Python
Imaging Library (which lets you draw into BMPs, JPEGs, and a host of
other image formats—useful for web graphics), OpenGL, Macintosh
QuickDraw, PostScript, Adobe Illustrator, Tkinter, wxPython, and
PythonWin. Not all of these implement all features correctly, but
things are evolving rapidly. When you get to <a href="pythonwin32_cnode157.html">Chapter 20</a>, bear in mind that one Python graphics library
can draw to all the GUI toolkits we cover.</p>







<h4>10.4.2
Fonts</h4>


<p>Each platform has a different font mechanism. PIDDLE defines a
<tt class="monofont">Font</TT>
<A NAMe="idx989"></A> class to rise above this. A
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">Font</TT> instance has attributes
<TT clasS="monofont">face</TT>, <Tt claSS="monofont">size</TT>,
<tt clASS="monofont">bold</Tt>, <tt class="monofont">italic</tt>, and
<tt class="monofont">underline</tt>. A standard set of font names are
provided, and each backend is responsible for finding the best local
equivalent.</p>







<h4>10.4.3
Colors</H4>


<P>
<A NAMe="idx990"></A>Color
class instances are created with red, green, and blue levels between
zero and one. The module creates a large number of colors based on
the HTML standard, so the word <Tt CLaSs="monofont">red</TT> may be used to
refer to a ready-made <TT clasS="monofont">Color</TT> object.</P>







<h4>10.4.4
Coordinate System</h4>


<p>T<a NAME="idx991"></a>he
PostScript default scale of 72 units per inch is used, but with the
origin at the top left of the page and y increasing downwards.</p>







<h4>10.4.5
Canvas Graphics Methods</h4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx992"></a>The
<tt class="monofont">Canvas</tt> class provides drawing methods and overall
management functions. The
<a name="idx993"></a>graphics
functions provided (we will skip the arguments) are
<tt cLASS="monofont">drawLine</TT>, <tT ClASs="monofont">drawLines</Tt>,
<TT CLass="monofont">drawString</tT>, <TT Class="monofont">drawCurve</TT> (which
draws a Bezier curve), <TT clasS="monofont">drawRect</TT>,
<Tt class="monofont">drawRoundRect</tt>, <tt class="monofont">drawEllipse</tt>,
<tt clASS="monofont">drawArc</TT>, <Tt CLaSS="monofont">drawPolygon</tT>, and
<tT CLAss="monofont">drawFigure</tt> (which can manage an arbitrary sequence
of line, arc, and curve segments). Each method accepts optional line
and fill colors and may be used to draw an outline or a filled shape.</P>







<H4>10.4.6
Canvas Attributes</H4>


<P>
<a namE="idx994"></A>At any
time the Canvas has a current font, line width, line color, and fill
color. Methods use the defaults unless alternatives are supplied as
arguments. Thus <TT clasS="monofont">drawLine(10,10,20,20)</TT> uses the
current settings; <Tt class="monofont">drawLine(10,10,20,20,
width=5,color=silver)</tt> does what it says but leaves the
current settings unchanged.</p>







<h4>10.4.7
Text Output</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx995"></a>The
<tt cLASS="monofont">drawString</TT>
<a NAmE="idx996"></A> method is extremely versatile. It allows
angled text (which forced some people to work hard at rotating
bitmaps for their platforms, but they managed it), control of color,
and printing of blocks of text with embedded newlines. A
<tT cLASS="monofont">stringWidth</tt>
<a nAME="idx997"></A> method allows string widths to be
measured, making it feasible to align and wrap text accurately.</p>







<h4>10.4.8
Image Support</h4>


<p>
<A NAMe="idx998"></a>PIDDLE can use the Python Imaging
Library to handle image data; bitmaps in many formats can be loaded,
and either placed at their natural size or stretched to fit a desired
rectangle.</p>







<h4>10.4.9
Test Framework</H4>


<P>As with all good Python packages, a test framework is provided that
runs a group of standard test patterns against the bundled backends.
<A href="pythonwin32_snode79.html#13">Figure 10.6</a> shows a standard test pattern.</p>

<h4>10.4.10
Video Recorder</H4>


<P>A special canvas called
<TT clasS="monofont">VCRCanvas</TT>
<A name="idx999"></a>
<a name="idx1000"></a>
works as a recorder: when you execute graphics commands, it saves
them for replay later. They are saved as text holding executable
Python code. This makes it possible for a specialized graphics
package to save a chart in a file, and for any other canvas to replay
that file in the absence of the original package.</p>



<p>Having discussed the base API, we now tackle two key output formats:
PostScript and PDF.<a name="idx1001"></a> <a nAME="idx1002"></A></P>
