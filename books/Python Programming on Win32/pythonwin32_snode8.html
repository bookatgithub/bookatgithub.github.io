<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>


<p>Although we were warned about what it takes to write a book like
this, we were still not prepared! Many people contributed to this
book and assisted with the enormous workload it involved.</p>



<P>The support of Guido van Rossum, the author of the Python language,
for the Windows version of Python has enabled it to develop into a
serious contender for most Windows development work. Guido somehow
manages to balance the opposing forces of maintaining platform
independence and allowing Python to take advantage of the
platform's unique features.</P>



<P>The wonderful Python community also has itself to thank for allowing
this book to come to fruition. The Python newsgroup seems to be one
of the final bastions of Usenet where spams are ignored, newbies are
treated kindly, and trolls are either ignored or quickly turned into
a serious and on-topic discussion. Many smart and friendly people
hang out on the newsgroup, and it's one of the more esoteric
reasons many people find using the language enjoyable.</P>



<p>The following people have provided invaluable help, whether with full
reviews, in-depth knowledge of particular areas, or informal
feedback: Guido van Rossum, Gordon McMillan, Greg Stein,
Marc-André Lemburg, Christian Tismer, Gary Herron, Robin Dunn,
Mike Da Silva, Richard Kennedy, and Damien Watkins. Many others too
numerous to mention, have played a part in shaping the book, whether
in direct correspondence with us or in developing and working with
the packages in this book.</p>



<p>At O'Reilly, we'd like to thank Robert Denn, Steven
Abrams, and probably a whole bunch of other people we have never
heard of.</p>



<P>Most important of all, Mark and Andy both wish to thank their
families for their support and incredible patience, and they promise
not to do this again any time soon.</P>
