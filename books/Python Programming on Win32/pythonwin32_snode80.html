<h3>10.5
PostScript</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1003"></a>The PostScript
language is the world's most famous <a naME="idx1004"></A>page description language.
It was developed by Adobe Systems in 1985 as a language for printer
drivers and was perhaps the key technology in the desktop publishing
revolution. It consists of commands for describing the printed page,
including both text and graphics. A text file of these commands is
sent to a PostScript printer, which prints them. PostScript has some
features other page description languages lack. For example, a font
is a collection of subroutines to draw arbitrary curves and shapes;
there's no difference in the way text and graphics are handled.
This contrasts with Windows, where you can perform arbitrary scaling
and translation of the lines in a chart, while watching all the
labels stay right where they are in the same point size.<Font sIZE="1"><Sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a></sup></font>

<sup><a NAME="FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a></sup>
Of course, it is possible to do zoomable views in Windows, but
it isn't easy. NT is beginning to approach PostScript in this
regard with its World Transforms, but these are not in Windows 95 and
thus have not been widely used.</P>

<p>This section is relevant only if you are aiming at a fairly high-end
printer. However, it's worth understanding something about
PostScript since it's the base for PDF, which is relevant to
everyone.</p>



<p>PostScript printers used to be quite specialized; however, as power
has increased, more printers are offering PostScript compliance,
e.g., the LaserJet 5 series. PostScript printers are the standard for
high-volume/high-quality printers.</p>



<p>PostScript is generally produced by printer drivers or by graphics
packages such as Illustrator, though masochists can do it by hand.
PostScript is usually drawn on the printer. However, the
public-domain package, GhostView, is available for rendering
PostScript files on Windows and other platforms. GhostView lets you
print to any printer, doing the best job it can with the local print
technology. It also makes it possible to test Python code for
generating PostScript without having a dedicated printer on hand.</p>



<p>Let's have a quick look at a chunk of PostScript:</p>


<a name="idx1005"></a>
<a namE="idx1006"></A>
<PRE ClASs="monofont">% Example PostScript file - this is a comment
72 720 moveto
72 72 lineto
/Helvetica findfont 24 scalefont setfont
80 720 moveto
('Hello World') show
showpage</PRe>


<P>Comments begin with <tT CLAss="monofont">%</tt>. Lines 2 and 3 find a font
and specify a size. The coordinate system uses 72 points per inch and
starts at the bottom left of the screen or page; thus, the commands
draw a line one inch from the left of the page, running for most of
its height, and the string "Hello World" near the top
left corner.</P>



<P>As you can see, PostScript is fairly readable; it's thus
extremely easy to build a Python library to spit out chunks of
PostScript. Furthermore, this can be done at very high speed; Python
excels at <A Name="idx1007"></a>text substitutions. That is what
the<A NAMe="idx1008"></a>
<tt CLASs="monofont">piddlePS</tt> module does; when you make a call such as
<tt class="monofont">drawLine(10,10,50,100, width=5)</tt>,
<tt class="monofont">piddlePS</tt> does some testing to see what needs
changing, then substitutes the numbers into a template string and
adds them to an output queue. Here is how it was implemented:</P>



<PRE CLaSS="monofont">def drawLine(self, x1, y1, x2, y2, color=None, width=None):
       self._updateLineColor(color)
       self._updateLineWidth(width)
       if self._currentColor != transparent:
          self.code.append('%s %s neg moveto %s %s neg lineto stroke' %
                           (x1, y1, x2, y2))</pRE>


<p>PostScript offers many capabilities beyond the scope of this chapter.
Specifically, it's a full-blown language, and you can write
subroutines to align text, wrap paragraphs, or even draw charts.
Another key ability is coordinate transformations; you can write a
routine to draw a shape, then translate, rotate, and scale space to
redraw it again elsewhere. The PostScript imaging model has been used
or copied in most vector graphic formats since it was developed.</P>
