<h3>10.6
Portable Document Format</h3>


<p>PDF is a recent evolution of PostScript. Whereas PostScript was
intended to be consumed by printers, PDF is designed for both online
viewing and printing. It allows for features such as clickable links,
clickable tables of contents, and sounds. It is intended as a final
form for documents. You could possibly edit PDF if you had a few
months to spare, but it isn't easy. It also remedies some basic
problems with PostScript. (PostScript contains arbitrary subroutines
that might generate pages in a loop or subject to conditions; so the
only way to look at page 499 of a 500-page document, or even to know
that there are 500 pages, is to execute the code and render it all.)</p>



<P>For the average developer, PDF is compelling because the
<A NAme="idx1009"></a>Acrobat
Reader is freely and widely available on almost all platforms. This
means you can produce a document that can be emailed, stored on the
Web, downloaded, and printed at leisure by your users, on almost any
platform. Furthermore, all they get is the document, not any attached
spreadsheets or data they shouldn't, and you can be confident
it won't be tampered with. For this reason, many companies are
looking at PDF as a format for much of their documentation.</p>



<P>PDF documents are generally created in two ways, both of which
involve buying Adobe Acrobat. This includes PDFWriter, a printer
driver that lets you print any document to a PDF file; and Distiller,
which turns PostScript files into PDF files. These are excellent
tools that fulfill many business needs.</P>



<P>PDF is a published specification, and in the last two years, a C
library and a Perl library have been written to generate PDF
directly. This was too much of a challenge to resist, so we have done
one in Python, too.</P>




<h4>10.6.1
The Structure of PDF</h4>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1010"></a>Technically, PDF is a complex language. The
specification is 400 pages long. If you don't want to know the
details, skip to the section <a href="pythonwin32_snode82.html">Section 10.7</a>. If
you do, it'd be a good idea to open one of the sample PDF files
provided with this chapter; unlike most you will find on the Web,
they are uncompressed and numbered in a sensible order. We've
provided a brief roadmap to the PDF format as we feel that it offers
many benefits, and you might want to add your own extensions in the
future.</p>



<p>The outer layer of the PDF format provides overall document
structure, specifying pages, fonts used, and advanced features such
as tables of contents, special effects, and so on. Each page is a
separate object and contains a stream of page-marking operators;
basically, highly abbreviated PostScript commands. The snippet of
PostScript you saw earlier would end up like this:</p>



<pre class="monofont">72 720 m
72 72 l
/F5 24 Tf 42 TL
80 720 Td
('Hello World') Tj</pre>


<P>Unfortunately this code, which can at least be decoded given time and
you know where to look, can be compressed in a binary form and is
buried inside an outer layer that's quite complex. The outer
layer consists of a series of numbered <I>objects</I>
(don't you love that word?) including pages, outlines,
clickable links, font resources, and many other elements. These are
delimited by the keywords <TT ClASs="monofont">obj</TT> and
<tT cLASS="monofont">endobj</tt> and numbered within the file. Here's
a <tt CLASs="monofont">Catalog</tt>
<a NAME="idx1011"></a> object, which sits at the top of
<a naME="idx1012"></A>PDF's object model:</P>



<pre class="monofont">1 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
/Type /Catalog
/Pages 3 0 R
/Outlines 2 0 R
&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Every object is a dictionary of keys and values. The
<tt class="monofont">Catalog</tt> is at position 1 in the file. It has a
<A NAME="idx1013"></A><tT ClASs="monofont">Pages</Tt> collection,
found at location 3 in the file. The <TT CLass="monofont">Pages</tT>
collection might contain individual
<TT Class="monofont">Page</TT>
<A Name="idx1014"></a> objects, or perhaps other
<TT CLass="monofont">Pages</tt> collections with subranges of the document.
These form a balanced tree, so that an application like Acrobat
Reader can locate the drawing code for page 3,724 in a 5,000 page
document in one second flat.</p>



<p>Once you get to a <tt class="monofont">Page</tt> object, you'll find a
declaration of the resources needed to draw the page, which includes
a list of fonts used and might include graphics function sets to load
into memory and a reference to a <tt claSS="monofont">Contents</TT> object.
A simple page and its associated small <TT cLAsS="monofont">Contents</Tt>
object might look like this:</P>



<pRE CLass="monofont">20 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
/Type /Page
/Parent 3 0 R
/Resources 
    &lt;&lt; 
    /Font         &lt;&lt; 
        /F1 5 0 R    % list of font declarations
        /F2 6 0 R    % - font objects are described elsewhere 
        /F3 7 0 R    % in the file
        /F4 8 0 R 
        /F5 9 0 R 
        &gt;&gt;
    /ProcSet 3 0 R        % reference to the sets of Postscript
    &gt;&gt;                    % drawing procedures to be loaded for page
/MediaBox [0 0 612 792]   % page in points - 8.5x11 US paper
/Contents 21 0 R          % reference to next object
&gt;&gt;
endobj
21 0 obj             % beginning of contents object
&lt;&lt; /Length 413 &gt;&gt;    % predeclare the stream length
stream
% line 2 units wide from 72,72 to 72, 720
q 2 w 72 72 m 72 720 l S Q  

BT                                  % begin text mode
/F6 48 Tf 80 672 Td 48 TL           % set font, position and size (48 pt)
(PDFgen) Tj T*                      % display a line of text
/F5 24 Tf24 TL                      % smaller font
80 640 Td                           % set text origin 
(Automatic PDF Generation) Tj T*    % more text
ET                                  % end text mode
endstream
endobj</pRE>


<P>Lurking near the bottom, between the <Tt claSS="monofont">stream</TT> and
<tt clASS="monofont">endstream</Tt> keywords in the
<tt class="monofont">Contents</tt>
<a name="idx1015"></a> object, you finally get to the
page-marking operators. Note also that the length of the stream of
contents operators is predeclared to allow it to be read quickly.</p>



<p>Finally, typically at the end of the document, you find an index
section that looks like this:</p>



<prE CLASS="monofont">xref
0 24
0000000000 65535 f
0000000017 00000 n
0000000089 00000 n
0000000141 00000 n
&lt;lines deleted to save space&gt;
0000005167 00000 n
trailer
&lt;&lt; /Size 24 /Root 1 0 R /Info 19 0 R&gt;&gt;
startxref
7164
%%EOF</pRE>


<p>When Acrobat Reader opens a file, it looks in the last few bytes for
the keyword <TT cLaSS="monofont">trailer</TT>. The
<tt clASS="monofont">trailer</Tt>
<a naME="idx1016"></A> object on the following line tells us
that there are 24 objects in the file; that the root is object number
1; and that information such as the document author and date are
available at object number 19. It then tells us that the
cross-reference table is found starting at byte 7164 in the file. The
cross-reference table itself (beginning at <Tt claSS="monofont">xref</TT> in
the first line) shows the positions of the objects; thus object 1,
the root, is at byte 17 in the file, and object 24 is at byte 5167.</p>



<p>This mechanism makes it possible to parse and process PDF documents
quickly, but it made developing a PDF generator harder. With HTML or
PostScript, you get instant gratification each time you output a
well-formed chunk of code, and you can start in a small way; with
PDF, you can't even look at it until you have correctly indexed
the whole thing.</p>



<p>The <i>PDFgen.py</i>
<a name="idx1017"></a> module wraps and hides most of this from
the user and constructs a well-formed document. Many advanced
features are missing, but the documents do open cleanly. The module
does this by having Python classes that mirror the PDF ones and by
building up a list of objects in memory. When it writes the file,
each returns a text representation of itself for the file, and the
<tt class="monofont">PDFDocument</tt>
<A NAME="idx1018"></A> class measures the length of this. The
module is thus able to build a valid index at the end. What it
doesn't do is the drawing. The module presumes that something
else feeds it a complete contents stream for each page. This is where
the PIDDLE interface comes in.</p>



<P>We won't go further into the implementation of the outer layer
of the PDF library here. Instead we'll look at a few details of
the current <A nAMe="idx1019"></A>frontend.</p>







<H4>10.6.2
Implementing the Frontend</H4>


<P>Once the PIDDLE API was stable, it was fairly straightforward to
implement a <Tt claSS="monofont">PDFCanvas</TT> object to provide a simple
API. Let's take a quick look at some of the methods of
the<a namE="idx1020"></A>
<TT clasS="monofont">PDFCanvas</TT> class and how they hook up with the
backend:</P>



<pre class="monofont">def __init__(self, filename):
        Canvas.__init__(self)
        self.filename = filename
        self.code = []  # list of strings to join later
        self.doc = pdfgen.PDFDocument()
        self.pageNumber = 1   # keep a count
        # various settings omitted</pre>


<p>When it starts up, the <tt class="monofont">PDFCanvas</tt> instance creates
a <TT CLASs="monofont">PDFDocument</TT> instance. This is the class that
manages the overall document structure. It also creates an empty
list, <tT ClAsS="monofont">self.code</TT>, to hold strings of page-marking
operators. The various drawing methods add the right operators to the
list in the same way the PostScript snippets did earlier. If you
compare the methods and output with the PostScript
<Tt claSS="monofont">PSCanvas</TT>, it's easy to see the
correspondence.</p>



<p>When you ask for a new page with the
<tt CLASs="monofont">showPage()</tt>
<a NAME="idx1021"></a> method, this happens:</p>



<pre class="monofont">def showPage(self):
        page = pdfgen.PDFPage()
        stream = string.join([self.preamble] + self.code, '\n')
        #print stream
        page.setStream(stream)
        self.doc.addPage(page)
        self.pageNumber = self.pageNumber + 1
        self.code = []    # ready for more...</pre>


<p>First, create a <tt class="monofont">PDFgen</TT>
<A NAMe="idx1022"></A> object called
<Tt CLaSs="monofont">PDFPage</TT>
<A Name="idx1023"></a>, which is responsible for generating the
output later. Then make a big string of page-marking operators by
joining a standard preamble (which does some work to set up
coordinate systems, default fonts, and so forth) and the list of
accumulated operators. This is stored in the
<TT CLass="monofont">PDFPage</tT>, which is then added to the
<TT Class="monofont">PDFDocument</TT>. <TT class="monofont">PDFgen</tt> takes care
of the rest when asked to save itself to disk. Finally, the page
number is incremented, and the list of strings is emptied, ready for
some more output.</p>
