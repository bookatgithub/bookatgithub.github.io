<h3>10.7
Putting It Together: A High-Volume Invoicing System</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1024"></a> <a naME="idx1025"></A>Rather than repeating the management
accounts we did in Word, we'll discuss a different situation.
Imagine that Pythonics is now doing a large volume of consulting work
and needs to bill customers by the hour on a weekly basis. An
internal database keeps track of who works for how many hours on
which project. At the end of each week, we need to raise correct
invoices and simultaneously enter them into our accounts system.
Although starting small, we'd like a system that will scale up
in the future.</P>



<p>We've built a tab-delimited text file called
<i>invoicing.dat</i>
<a NAME="idx1026"></a> that contains a list of the fields for
each invoice; basically, the customer details, date, invoice number,
number of hours worked, hourly rate, and so on. In a real
application, this data might come from database queries, flat files,
or already be available as an object model in memory. The script to
generate the invoices is 200 lines long and is mostly graphics code;
we'll show some excerpts. First, the main loop:</p>



<pre class="monofont">def run():
    import os
    invoices = acquireData()   # parse the data file
    print 'loaded data'
    for invoice in invoices:
        printInvoice(invoice)
    print 'Done'</pre>


<p>We'll skip the data acquisition. Note also that in a real
financial application, you'd extract transaction objects from
your invoice objects and save them in a <tt class="monofont">BookSet</TT> at
the point of printing.</P>



<P>For each invoice, construct a <TT cLAsS="monofont">PDFCanvas</Tt>, call
various drawing subroutines, and save it with an appropriate
filename. In this case, the filename encodes the invoice number and
client name:</P>



<pRE CLass="monofont">def printInvoice(inv):
    #first see what to call it
    
    filename = 'INVOICE_%d_%s.PDF' % (inv.InvoiceID, inv.ClientID)
    canv = pdfcanvas.PDFCanvas(filename)
    
    #make up the standard fonts we need and attach to the canvas
    canv.standardFont = pdfcanvas.Font(face='Helvetica',size=12)
    canv.boldFont = pdfcanvas.Font(face='Helvetica',bold=1, size=12)
        
    #now all the static repeated elements
    drawHeader(canv, filename)
    drawOwnAddress(canv)
    
    # now all the data elements
    drawGrid(canv, inv)
    drawCustomerAddress(canv, inv)
    drawInvoiceDetails(canv, inv)
    
    #save
    canv.flush()</pRE>


<P>Here's one of the drawing functions,
<Tt claSS="monofont">drawOwnAddress()</TT>
<a namE="idx1027"></A>. It's passed the canvas to draw
on and the invoice; it does what you'd expect:</P>



<Pre class="monofont">def drawOwnAddress(canv):
    address = ['Village Business Centre',
            'Thornton Hill',
            'Wimbledon Village',
            'London SW19 8PY',
            'Tel +44-181-123-4567']
    fnt = Font(face='Helvetica',size=12,italic=1)
    canv.drawStrings(address, INCH, INCH * 1.5, fnt)</pre>


<p>Other methods draw tables, format the numbers, and output them in the
right places using methods of the <tt class="monofont">PDFCanvas</tt>. Users
don't need to worry about the details of the file format.</p>



<P>In practice, you'd use a standard script handler so that the
script could be run with a double-click. Here it's run
interactively. Running the script generates one file for each
customer, at a rate of several files per second:</P>

<P>
<A NaME="idx1028"></a>Now, let's look
at the benefits of this architecture from a business perspective:</P>



<Ul>
<Li><P>The report took only about two hours to assemble, including data
acquisition.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>You have a simple script that can be run with a double-click or
scheduled to go off at night: no need to launch applications
manually.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>The output is filed with the correct names in an immutable format. If
a dispute or problem arises in the future, you can instantly find the
file and see exactly what was sent.</p>
</li>
<LI><P>The entries have been made in the accounts system at the same time.
It's easy to add further steps to the logic, such as emailing
invoices to suppliers.</P>
</li>
<li><P>The system is fast and light; it runs well with tens of thousands of
pages and can be moved from a desktop PC to a Unix server with no
modifications.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>It's easy to customize. You don't need a lot of Python,
and there is a simple drawing API. Power users could learn to
customize it or write their own reports easily.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data can be acquired from anything with Python: files, databases,
spreadsheets, or other Python applications. You aren't tied to
a database engine.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>10.7.1
Advanced Techniques and Possibilities with PDF and PIDDLE</h4>


<p>
<a namE="idx1029"></A> <A NAMe="idx1030"></A>There are several more techniques and
improvements we haven't added, but that could be easily
accomplished if the need arose. This is Open Source, so if they sound
useful, they probably will be done by somebody by the time you read
this.</P>

<i><fONT Color="#990000">Object-oriented graphics and page layout API</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The PIDDLE team is working on the "next layer up," which
will hopefully be available by the time this book is printed. This
consists of two ideas. First of all, frames identify regions on the
page into which drawing may take place; users may specify one main
frame per page, or as many as they wish. Second, we create a
hierarchy of drawable objects, allowing a high level of reuse. These
objects know their size and can wrap themselves to fit a frame if
needed. They can be "poured into" a frame until it fills.
A <tt class="monofont">Table</TT> object might be initialized with an array
of data and draw default table cells by itself; named styles allow
quick and easy formatting of large tables. A
<TT CLaSS="monofont">Paragraph</tT> object, again tied to a list of styles,
allows rapid formatting of text. Individual PIDDLE drawings can also
constitute drawable objects and define their own coordinate systems
for their contents.</P>

<I><FOnt coLOR="#990000">Volume optimizations</Font></i></DT>
<DD>
<p>The example script runs at about four pages per second, a lot faster
than any printer, but nowhere near the speed limit. A large amount of
processing is going into generating a text stream, which is almost
the same for each page. You can generate the page once and substitute
variables using Python's dictionary-substitution facility. This
lets you generate documents as fast as the disk can write; however,
it's applicable only for simple one-record-per-page forms.</p>



<p>PDF provides a similar trick: you can create something called a PDF
form,<i> </I>which is a content stream that can be
reused within a document. The reusable parts of the page can be
placed in a form and stored once, and only the numbers and text that
change need to print. This reduces the size of a huge invoice print
run by 90% or more and leads to faster printing on the right
printers.</P>
</DD>
<dt>
<i><font color="#990000">Imported graphics</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<P>A large number of graphics packages work with PostScript. You can
design pages or graphic elements in a tool such as
<A NAME="idx1031"></a>Adobe
Illustrator. These elements can be distilled and the PDF page-marking
operators lifted out into a library, with some parsing tools that
would be straightforward to write in Python. This library combines
the freedom of visual design tools with the discipline and speed of
report programs.</P>
</Dd>
<DT>
<i><FoNT COlor="#990000">Onscreen views</fONT></I></dt>
<dd>
<P>The testing cycle was pretty fast—run a script, load the
document to Acrobat in less than two seconds. However, the PIDDLE API
is not platform-specific. You can use it to provide a printing engine
for graphical applications; the same code that drew charts on the
screen using a Windows or Tkinter backend generates a PDF report for
free.</P>
</DD>
<dt>
<i><fONT Color="#990000">Plotting</font></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>As discussed earlier, a key motivation for PIDDLE was to create
plotting libraries that were not tied to one backend. The
<a name="idx1032"></a>Graphite
package (<a NAME="idx1033"></A>
<A nAMe="idx1034"></A><A tArGET="_blank" Href="http://www.strout.net/python/graphite/default.htm">www.strout.net/python/graphite/</a> ) was
developed alongside PIDDLE and is already capable of a wide range of
plot types. Given Python's strong presence in the scientific
world, we expect exciting developments here. <A href="pythonwin32_snode82.html#5">Figure 10.8</a> is a sample from Graphite.</p>
