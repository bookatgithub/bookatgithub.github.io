<H3>12.1
Advanced COM</H3>


<P>In order to fully understand Python and COM, it is necessary to
understand COM itself. Although Python hides many of the
implementation details, understanding these details makes working
with Python and COM much easier.</P>



<p>If you want to see how to use Python to control COM objects such as
Microsoft Word or Excel, you can jump directly to the section <a href="pythonwin32_snode95.html">Section 12.3</A>.</P>




<h4>12.1.1
Interfaces and Objects</h4>


<p>COM makes a clear distinction between
<i>interfaces</I>
<A NAme="idx1051"></a>
and
<i>objects</i>
<a name="idx1052"></a>.
An interface describes certain functionality, while an object
implements that functionality (that is, implements the interface). An
interface describes how an object is to behave, while the object
itself implements the behavior. For example, COM defines an
<tt class="monofont">IStream</tt>
<a NAME="idx1053"></A> interface, a generic interface for
reading and writing, in a manner similar to a file. Although COM
defines the <Tt CLaSS="monofont">IStream</tT> interface, it's the
responsibility of objects to implement the interface; thus, you may
have an object that implements the <TT CLAss="monofont">IStream</tt>
interface writing to and from files or an object implementing the
<TT CLass="monofont">IStream</tT> interface using sockets, and so forth.
This is a huge advantage to users of these interfaces, because you
can code to the <TT Class="monofont">IStream</TT> interface, and your code
works regardless of whether your data goes to a file or out over a
socket. Each COM interface has a unique 128-bit GUID known as an
<A Name="idx1054"></a>
<a name="idx1055"></a>interface
ID (IID).</p>



<p>An interface defines a series of methods: interfaces can't have
properties. An interface is defined in terms of a C++
<tt class="monofont">vtable</tt>
<A NAME="idx1056"></A>.
Highly experienced C++ programmers will know that a
<tT ClASs="monofont">vtable</TT> implements virtual methods in C++.</P>



<P>Just as with C++, COM allows one interface to derive from, or extend,
another interface; in fact, COM explicitly requires it. COM defines
an interface known as
<TT clasS="monofont">IUnknown</TT>
<A name="idx1057"></A>, which is the root (or base) of all
COM interfaces; that is, all COM interfaces explicitly support the
<TT Class="monofont">IUnknown</TT> interface. <TT class="monofont">IUnknown</tt> is
a simple interface defining only three methods:
<tt class="monofont">AddRef()</tt>
<a name="idx1058"></A> <A NAME="idx1059"></a> <A NaME="idx1060"></a>, <TT CLASs="monofont">Release()</tt>, and
<tT CLAss="monofont">QueryInterface()</tt>. <TT CLass="monofont">AddRef()</tT> and
<TT Class="monofont">Release()</tt> manage object
<a name="idx1061"></a>
<a name="idx1062"></a>lifetimes; a reference counting technique
is used so a particular object knows when it is no longer needed. The
Python COM framework manages this behind the scenes for you, so these
will not be discussed further. <tt cLASS="monofont">QueryInterface()</TT>
allows an object to return a specific interface, given that
interface's unique IID. Thus, regardless of the object you
have, you can always call its <tT ClASs="monofont">QueryInterface()</TT>
method to obtain a new interface, such as <TT CLass="monofont">IStream</tT>.</P>



<P>COM also defines a standard technique for identifying and creating
objects themselves. Each object class is identified by a
<A name="idx1063"></A>
<A NAme="idx1064"></a>
<a NAME="idx1065"></a>class ID (CLSID, also a GUID) that
exposes interfaces, each identified by an IID. Thus, there are a
number of
<a name="idx1066"></a>identifiers
associated with every COM object: the CLSID identifying the class
that provides the object, and a series of IIDs for each interface the
object supports. Each
<a name="idx1067"></a>object supports at least two
interfaces, the <tt class="monofont">IUnknown</tT> interface as described
previously, and some useful interface (such as
<TT CLAsS="monofont">IStream</Tt>) that allows the object to perform its
task.</P>



<P>Objects may also register a program ID, or <a NAME="idx1068"></A>ProgID as well as a CLSID. A ProgID
is a string describing the object, suitable for use by humans. When
you need to create a particular object, it's usually more
convenient to use the ProgID rather than the CLSID. There is no
guarantee that ProgIDs will be unique on a given system; you should
choose the names of your objects carefully to avoid conflicts with
other objects. For example, the Microsoft Excel object has a ProgID
of <Tt claSS="monofont">Excel.Application</TT>.</p>







<h4>12.1.2
The IDispatch Interface</h4>


<p>The COM architecture works well for languages such as C++, where the
methods you need to use are known beforehand (i.e., at compile time).
You create an object using the standard COM techniques, then perform
a <TT CLass="monofont">QueryInterface()</tT> on the object for a particular
interface. Once you have the interface, you can make calls on its
methods. This architecture does have some drawbacks, notably:</P>



<UL>
<li><p>
<a name="idx1069"></a>There is support for methods, but no
support for properties. In many cases, properties would simplify the
object model you are attempting to publish.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It doesn't work as well when using higher-level languages than
C++. There may be no compile-time step involved at all. The language
in use may not support using the <i>.IDL</i> or <i>.H</i> files necessary to obtain the definition
of these interfaces.</p>
</lI>
</UL>
<P>COM defines the
<TT cLAsS="monofont">IDispatch</Tt>
<A NAME="idx1070"></A> interface specifically to meet the
requirements of these higher-level languages. The
<tt clASS="monofont">IDispatch</Tt> interface allows an object to expose an
object model (complete with methods and properties) and allows the
user of the object to determine the methods and properties available
at runtime. This means the methods or properties you need to call can
be determined when you need to call them, rather than requiring them
to be predefined. You should note that the object model exposed using
<tt cLASS="monofont">IDispatch</tt> is quite distinct from the
<tt CLASs="monofont">IDispatch</tt> interface itself;
<tt class="monofont">IDispatch</tt> is a COM interface that allows an
arbitrary object model to be exposed. In other words,
<tt class="monofont">IDispatch</tt> is not the object model but is the
mechanism that allows an object model to be exposed.</P>



<P>There are two methods <TT CLaSS="monofont">IDispatch</tT> defines for this
purpose. The first is
<Tt CLASS="monofont">GetIDsOfNames()</Tt>
<a naME="idx1071"></A>; it allows you to ask an object
"do you have a method/property named <Tt claSS="monofont">foo
</TT>?" If the object does have such an attribute, it
returns an integer ID for the method or property. The method
<tt clASS="monofont">Invoke()</Tt>
<a name="idx1072"></a> performs the actual operation on the
object—that is, either calling the method
<tt class="monofont">foo</tt>, or getting or setting a property named
<tt claSS="monofont">foo</TT>. The <TT cLAsS="monofont">Invoke()</Tt> method is
passed the integer ID obtained from
<TT CLASs="monofont">GetIDsOfNames()</tt>, as well as any parameters for the
function or property.</p>



<P>In almost all languages, you don't need to use the
<TT Class="monofont">IDispatch</TT> interface; your language uses
<TT clasS="monofont">IDispatch</TT> behind the scenes to present a natural
model. For example, we'll see later that when you execute code
in VB, Python, Delphi, and so forth similar to:</P>



<pre class="monofont">workbook = excel.Workbooks.Add()</pre>


<p>behind the scenes, there is pseudo-code similar to:</p>



<pre class="monofont">propertyId = excel-&gt;GetIDsOfNames("Workbook")
newObject = excel-&gt;Invoke(propertyId, DISPATCH_PROPERTYGET)
methodId = newObject-&gt;GetIDsOfNames("Add")
result = newObject-&gt;Invoke(methodId, DISPATCH_METHOD)</PRE>


<P>The final piece of this puzzle relates to how the arguments and
results are passed around. For this purpose, COM defines a
<TT cLAsS="monofont">VARIANT</Tt>
<A NAME="idx1073"></A> data structure. A
<tt clASS="monofont">VARIANT</Tt> is defined as a self-describing C++ union
and allows a wide variety of common data-types to be passed. To
create a <tt cLASS="monofont">VARIANT</tt>, indicate the type of data you
wish to pass and set the value. When you need to use a
<tt CLASs="monofont">VARIANT</tt> passed by someone else, first query the
type of data it holds and obtain the data. If the type of the data
doesn't work for you, you can either attempt a conversion or
reject the call returning the appropriate error code. This implies
that type checking of the parameters and results can happen only at
runtime (although many tools can take advantage of type information
provided by the object to flag such errors at compile-time). As with
the <tt class="monofont">IDispatch</tt> interface itself, most high-level
languages hide the details of the <tt class="monofont">VARIANT</tt> and use
them invisibly behind the scenes.</P>



<P>Objects that expose an <TT CLaSS="monofont">IDispatch</tT> interface to
support method calls and property references are also known as
<I>automation
objects</i>
<A NAME="idx1074"></A>.</p>







<h4>12.1.3
Late- Versus Early-Bound IDispatch</h4>


<p>The process described for <TT CLass="monofont">IDispatch</tT> has one
obvious flaw: it seems highly inefficient, and it is! In many cases,
the inefficiency isn't important; the objects you need to call
will often take longer to do their thing than it took to make the
call.</P>



<P>Programs or languages that use <Tt claSS="monofont">IDispatch</TT> in the
manner described are known as
<i>late-bound</i>
<a name="idx1075"></a>,
because the binding of objects to methods or properties is done at
the last possible moment, as the call or property reference is made.</p>



<p>There is, however, a technique automation objects use to publish
their object model in a type library. <a name="idx1076"></a>
<a name="idx1077"></A>Type libraries define a set of
interfaces a program can use to determine both the methods and
properties themselves, and other useful information, such as the type
of the parameters or return values. Languages or environments may be
capable of using this information at compile-time to provide a better
interface to the objects. The key benefits of knowing this
information before it's used are:</P>



<UL>
<LI><p>The <TT cLAsS="monofont">GetIDsOfNames()</TT> step described previously can
be removed, as the type information includes the integer ID of each
method or property.</P>
</LI>
<li><p>Better type checking can be performed.</p>
</LI>
</UL>
<p>Languages that use the <tt cLASS="monofont">IDispatch</tt> interface after
consulting type information are known as
<i>early-bound</i>
<A NAMe="idx1078"></a>.</p>



<p>Most COM-aware
<a name="idx1079"></a>languages,
including Visual Basic, Delphi, and Python have techniques that allow
the programmer to choose between the binding models. Later in this
chapter we discuss the differences when using Python.</p>







<h4>12.1.4
Using or Implementing Objects</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1080"></a>There is a clear distinction between
using COM objects and implementing COM objects. When you use a COM
object, you make method calls on an object provided externally. When
you implement a COM object, you publish an object with a number of
interfaces external clients can use.</p>



<P>This distinction is just as true for the
<TT CLAsS="monofont">IDispatch</Tt>
<A NaME="idx1081"></A> interface; programs that use an
<TT Class="monofont">IDispatch</TT> object must call the
<TT clasS="monofont">GetIDsOfNames()</TT> and <Tt claSS="monofont">Invoke()</TT>
methods to perform method calls or property reference. Objects that
wish to allow themselves to be called via
<tt class="monofont">IDispatch</tt> must implement the
<tt class="monofont">GetIDsOfNames()</tt> and <tt cLASS="monofont">Invoke()</TT>
methods, providing the logic for translating between names and IDs,
and so forth.</p>



<P>In the PythonCOM world, this distinction is known as client-
<A nAMe="idx1082"></A> <A NAME="idx1083"></a> <a naME="idx1084"></A>
<A name="idx1085"></A>and server-side COM. Python programs that
need to use COM interfaces use client-side COM, while Python programs
that implement COM interfaces use server-side COM.</P>







<H4>12.1.5
InProc Versus LocalServer Versus RemoteServer</H4>


<p>COM objects can be implemented either in Windows DLLs or in separate
Windows processes via an EXE.</p>



<p>Objects implemented in <a NAME="idx1086"></a>DLLs are loaded into the process of the
calling object. For example, if your program creates an object
implemented in a DLL, that object's DLL is loaded into your
process, and the object is used directly from the DLL. These objects
are known as <i>InProc</i>
<a name="idx1087"></a>
<a name="idx1088"></a>
<i>objects</i>.</p>



<p>Objects implemented in their own process, obviously, use their own
process. If your program creates a COM object implemented in an
<a nAME="idx1089"></A>EXE, COM automatically starts the process for
the object (if not already running) and manages the plumbing between
the two processes. Objects implemented in an EXE that run on the
local machine are known as
<TT cLAsS="monofont">LocalServer</Tt>
<A NAME="idx1090"></A>
<a namE="idx1091"></A>
objects, while objects implemented in an EXE that run on a remote
machine are known as
<TT clasS="monofont">RemoteServer</TT>
<A name="idx1092"></A>
<A NAme="idx1093"></a>
objects. We discuss <tt class="monofont">RemoteServer</tt> objects in the
later section <a href="pythonwin32_snode99.html">Section 12.7</a>.</p>



<p>These options are not mutually exclusive; any object can be
registered so that it runs in either, all, or any combination of
these.</p>



<P>In most cases, you don't need to be aware of this COM
implementation detail. You can simply create an object and exactly
how that object is created is managed for you. There are, however,
some instances where being able to explicitly control this behavior
is to your advantage.</P>



<P>Python and COM support <TT ClASs="monofont">InProc</TT>,
<tT CLASS="monofont">LocalServer</tt>, and <tt CLASs="monofont">RemoteServer</tt>
objects, as discussed throughout this chapter.</p>
