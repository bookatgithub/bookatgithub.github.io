<h3>12.3
Using Automation Objects from Python</h3>


<p>As we discussed previously, automation objects are COM objects that
expose methods and properties using the <tT CLAss="monofont">IDispatch</tt>
interface. So how do we use these objects from Python? The
<TT CLass="monofont">win32com.client</tT> package contains a number of
modules to provide access to
<A NAme="idx1103"></a>automation
objects. This package supports both late and early bindings, as we
will discuss.</p>



<p>To use an <tt class="monofont">IDispatch</tt>-based COM object, use the
method
<tt class="monofont">win32com.client.Dispatch()</TT>
<A NAMe="idx1104"></A>. This method takes as its first
parameter the ProgID or CLSID of the object you wish to create. If
you read the documentation for Microsoft Excel, you'll find the
ProgID for Excel is <Tt CLaSs="monofont">Excel.Application</TT>, so to
create an object that interfaces to <A Name="idx1105"></a>Excel, use the following code:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32com.client
&gt;&gt;&gt; xl = win32com.client.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<p><tt cLASS="monofont">xl</tt> is now an object representing Excel. The Excel
documentation also says that a boolean property named
<tt class="monofont">Visible</tt> is available, so you can set that with
this code:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xl.Visible = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pRE>



<H4>12.3.1
Late-Bound Automation</H4>


<P>
<A nAMe="idx1106"></A>
<A nAmE="idx1107"></A>Late-bound
automation means that the language doesn't have advance
knowledge of the properties and methods available for the object.
When a property or method is referenced, the object is queried for
the property or the method, and if the query succeeds, the call can
be made. For example, when the language sees code such as:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">xl.Visible = 1</Pre>


<p>the language first queries the <tT CLAss="monofont">xl</tt> object to
determine if there is a property named <TT CLass="monofont">Visible</tt>,
and if so, asks the object to set the value to 1.</p>



<p>By default, the <tt class="monofont">win32com.client</tt> package uses
late-bound automation when using objects. In the examples we've
seen so far, the <tt claSS="monofont">win32com.client</TT> package has
determined the <TT cLAsS="monofont">Visible</Tt> property is available as
you attempt to use it. In the parlance of PythonCOM, this is known as
<I>dynamic dispatch</i>
<A NAMe="idx1108"></a>.</p>



<p>If you look at the object, Python responds with:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; `xl`
&lt;COMObject Excel.Application&gt;</PRE>


<p>This says there's a COM object named
<tt cLASS="monofont">Excel.Application</tt>. Python knows the name
<tt class="monofont">Excel.Application</tt> from the ProgID that created the
object.</p>







<h4>12.3.2
Early-Bound Automation</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1109"></a>The
PythonCOM package can also use early binding for COM objects. This
means that the information about the object model (i.e., the
properties and methods available for an object) is determined in
advance from type information supplied by the object.</P>



<P>
<A NAMe="idx1110"></A>Python uses the MakePy utility to
support early-bound automation. MakePy is a utility written in Python
that uses a COM type library to generate Python source code
supporting the interface. Once you use the MakePy utility, early
binding for the objects is automatically supported; there's no
need to do anything special to take advantage of the early binding.</P>



<p>There are a number of good reasons to use <A NaMe="idx1111"></A>MakePy:</P>



<UL>
<li><p>The Python interface to automation objects is faster for objects
supported by a MakePy module.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>Any constants defined by the type library are made available to the
Python program. We discuss COM constants in more detail later in the
chapter.</p>
</li>
<LI><P>There is much better support for advanced parameter types,
specifically, parameters declared by COM as BYREF can be used only
with MakePy-supported objects. We discuss passing parameters later in
the chapter.</P>
</li>
</ul>
<P>And there are a few reasons to avoid MakePy:</P>



<UL>
<li><p>Using a MakePy-supported object means you must run MakePy before code
that requires it can be used. Although this step can be automated
(i.e., made part of your program), you may choose to avoid it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The MakePy-generated files can be huge. The file generated for
Microsoft Excel is around 800 KB, a large Python source file by
anyone's standards. The time taken to generate a file of this
size, and subsequently have Python compile it, can be quite large
(although it's worth noting Python can then import the final
<i>.pyc</i> file quickly).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>12.3.2.1
Running MakePy</h5>


<p>MakePy is a normal Python module that lives in the
<i>win32com\client
</i>
<A NAME="idx1112"></A>directory of the PythonCOM package.
There are two ways to run this script:</p>



<UL>
<lI><P>Start PythonWin, and from the Tools menu, select the item COM Makepy
utility.</p>
</Li>
<LI><P>Using Windows Explorer, locate the client subdirectory under the main
<I>win32com</i> directory and double-click the file
<i>makepy.py</i>.</p>
</LI>
</UL>
<p>In both cases, you are presented with a list of objects MakePy can
use to support early binding.</p>



<p>We will try this out, continuing our example of using Microsoft
Excel. Let's start PythonWin, and select the COM Makepy utility
from the Tools menu. You are then presented with a list that looks
similar to that shown in <a href="pythonwin32_snode95.html#5">Figure 12.1</a>.</p>



<ceNTER>
<h5>
<a name="5"></a>Figure 12.1. An example list of objects presented by MakePy</h5>

<img border="0" widtH="502" HEIGHt="286" src="FILES/ppw.1201.gif" ALt="figs/ppw.1201.gif"></CeNTER>


<p>The exact contents of the list depends on the software you have
installed on your PC. Scroll down until you find the entry Microsoft
Excel 8.0 Object Library (1.2, or the entry that represents the
version of Excel you have installed) and press Enter. You should see
a progress bar displayed as MakePy does its thing, and when complete,
you should see a message in the PythonWin interactive window:</p>



<prE CLAss="monofont">Generating to c:\Program Files\Python\win32com\gen_py\00020813-0000-0000-C000-000000000046x0x1x2.py</prE>


<P>Your first reaction may be one of horror: how are you supposed to use
a filename that looks like that? The good news is that you
don't need to; just use PythonCOM as normal, but from now on,
all references to the Excel object model use the early binding
features generated by MakePy.</P>



<P>Now we have created MakePy support; let's see it in action. You
can either use the existing PythonWin session, or start a new session
and use the same code used earlier to create the
<tt clASS="monofont">Excel.Application</Tt> object:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32com.client
&gt;&gt;&gt; xl=win32com.client.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>And you can still set the <tt class="monofont">Visible</TT> property:</P>



<PRE cLAsS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xl.Visible=1
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PrE>


<p>At this stage, the only difference is when you print the
<TT CLass="monofont">xl</tT> object:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; `xl`
&lt;win32com.gen_py.Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library._Application&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRe>


<p>If you compare this with the output Python presented in the previous
example, note that Python knows more about the object; it has
referenced the name of the type library (Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object
Library) and the name of the object as defined by Excel itself
(<tt CLASs="monofont">_Application</tt>).</p>






<h5>12.3.2.2
How MakePy works</h5>


<p>In most cases, you don't need to know how MakePy works, but in
certain cases, particularly when tracking down problems, it is handy
to know.</p>



<p>The<a name="idx1113"></a>
<tt clasS="monofont">makepy</TT> module generates Python source code into a
standard <I>.py</I> source file. The
items in this file may include:</P>



<uL>
<Li><P>A standard Python class for each automation object included in the
type library</P>
</lI>
<lI><P>A set of constants exposed by the type library</P>
</Li>
</ul>
<p>The Python class has one method for each of the methods defined by
the object and a list of properties supported by the object.
Let's take a look at some generated code.</P>



<P>Let's open the source file you generated previously for
Microsoft Excel. The simplest way to open this file is to copy the
name of the file from the PythonWin interactive window, then paste it
into the File Open dialog of your favorite editor.</P>



<P>To find the class definition for the Excel
<tt clASS="monofont">_Application</Tt> object, you can perform a search for
<tt cLASS="monofont">class _Application</tt>, and locate code similar to
this:</p>



<pre class="monofont">class _Application(DispatchBaseClass):
  CLSID = pythoncom.MakeIID('{000208D5-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}')
  def ActivateMicrosoftApp(self, Index=defaultNamedNotOptArg):
    return self._ApplyTypes_(0x447, 1, (24, 0), ((3, 1),), \
                             'ActivateMicrosoftApp', None, Index)

  def AddChartAutoFormat(self, Chart=defaultNamedNotOptArg, \
                               Name=defaultNamedNotOptArg, \
                               Description=defaultNamedOptArg):
    return self._ApplyTypes_(0xd8, 1, (24, 0), ((12, 1), (8, 1), (12, 17)),\
                      'AddChartAutoFormat', None, Chart, Name, Description)</pre>


<p>There are many more methods. Each method includes the name of each
parameter (including a default value). You will notice the series of
magic numbers passed to the <tt clasS="monofont">_ApplyTypes_()</TT> method;
these describe the types of the parameters and are used by the
PythonCOM framework to correctly translate the Python objects to the
required <TT ClASs="monofont">VARIANT</TT> type.</p>



<P>Each class also has a list of properties available for the object.
These properties also have cryptic type information similar to the
methods, so properties also benefit from the increased knowledge of
the parameters.</p>



<P>At the end of the generated source file, there is a Python dictionary
describing all the objects supported in the module. For example, our
module generated for Excel has entries:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">CLSIDToClassMap = {
  '{00024428-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}' : _QueryTable,
  '{00024423-0001-0000-C000-000000000046}' : ICustomView,
  '{00024424-0001-0000-C000-000000000046}' : IFormatConditions,
  '{00024425-0001-0000-C000-000000000046}' : IFormatCondition,
  '{00024420-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}' : CalculatedFields,
  # And many, many more removed!
}</PRe>


<p>This dictionary is used at runtime to convert COM objects into the
actual classes defined in the module. When the PythonCOM framework
receives an <tt CLASs="monofont">IDispatch</tt> object, it asks the object
for its Class ID (CLSID), then consults the map for the class that
provides the interface to the object.<a NAME="idx1114"></a></p>








<h4>12.3.3
Forcing Early or Late Binding</h4>


<p>
<a name="idx1115"></a>
<a name="idx1116"></a>When you
use the
<tt clASS="monofont">win32com.client.Dispatch()</TT>
<A nAMe="idx1117"></A>
method, the PythonCOM framework automatically selects the best
available binding method; if MakePy support for an object exists, it
provides early binding; otherwise the <A nAmE="idx1118"></A>dynamic dispatch method provides late
binding. In some cases, you may wish to get explicit control over the
binding method.</P>



<P>The <tt clASS="monofont">win32com.client.Dispatch()</Tt> method achieves
this functionality by initially checking to see if MakePy support
exists for the object. If MakePy support doesn't exist, the
Python module <tt cLASS="monofont">win32com.client.dynamic</tt> is called to
perform the late-bound functionality. To force late binding for your
objects, use the <tt CLASs="monofont">win32com.client.dynamic</tt> module
directly, bypassing any MakePy-generated objects.</p>



<p>The
<tt class="monofont">win32com.client.dynamic</tt>
<a name="idx1119"></a> module contains only one function
designed to be used by Python programmers,
<tT CLASS="monofont">win32com.client.dynamic.Dispatch()</tT>
<A nAMe="idx1120"></A>. This function is used in the same way
as <tT CLAss="monofont">win32com.client.Dispatch()</tt>, except that MakePy
support is never used for the returned object.</P>



<P>To force the use of early binding to access COM objects, you must
force the MakePy process in your code. Once you have ensured the
MakePy support exists, use
<TT clasS="monofont">win32com.client.Dispatch()</TT> as usual. It always
returns the MakePy-supported wrappers for your COM object.</P>



<p>To force the MakePy process, the
<tt cLASS="monofont">win32com.client.gencache</tt>
<a name="idx1121"></a> module is used. This module contains the
code that manages the directory of MakePy-generated source files: the
generated cache, or <i>gencache</i>. There are a number
of useful functions in this module, and you are encouraged to browse
the source file if you need to perform advanced management of these
generated files.</p>



<p>To generate a MakePy file at runtime, you need to know the unique ID
of the type library (a CLSID) and its version and language
identifier. This information is usually not easy to find, so the
MakePy module supports a convenient method to obtain this
information.</p>



<p>If you run the MakePy script with a <a name="idx1122"></a>-<tT CLASS="monofont">i</tT> parameter, instead of
generating the source module, it prints the information necessary to
force the MakePy process at run-time. The easiest way to do this is
to perform the following steps:</P>



<oL TyPe="1">
<LI><P>Start PythonWin and select File <Img boRDER="0" aligN="absmiddle" WIDth="20" heIGHT="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" alt="figs/U2192.gif"> Run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the Browse button and locate the file
<i>makepy.py</i> in the
<i>win32com\client</i> directory.</p>
</li>
<li><P>Enter -<TT CLAsS="monofont">i</Tt> in the arguments control.</P>
</Li>
</Ol>

<P>Your dialog should now look something like <A href="pythonwin32_snode95.html#10">Figure 12.2</a>.</p>



<CENTer>
<h5>
<a NAME="10"></a>Figure 12.2. Running MakePy with the -i argument</h5>

<imG BORder="0" width="502" height="121" src="FILES/ppw.1202.gif" alt="figs/ppw.1202.gif"></cENTER>


<P>Click on the OK button and again select the entry Microsoft Excel 8.0
Object Library (1.2). You should see the following text printed in
the PythonWin interactive window:</p>



<PRe CLaSs="monofont">{00020813-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}, lcid=0, major=1, minor=2
 &gt;&gt;&gt; # Use these commands in Python code to auto generate .py support
 &gt;&gt;&gt; from win32com.client import gencache
 &gt;&gt;&gt; gencache.EnsureModule('{00020813-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}', 0, 1, 2)</PRE>


<P>Let's tie all this together in a file that demonstrates what
we've covered so far.</p>



<p>
<a nAME="idx1123"></A>The following example first creates a
late-bound object for Microsoft Excel, then forces MakePy to be run
over the type library and create an early-bound object. You do
nothing with the object; simply print the object to the output
window:</p>



<pre CLASs="monofont"># LateAndEarly.py - Demonstrates how to force
# late or early binding of your COM objects.

import win32com.client
import win32com.client.dynamic

print "Creating late-bound Excel object"
xl = win32com.client.dynamic.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
print "The Excel object is", `xl`


print "Running makepy for Excel"
# NOTE - these 2 lines are copied verbatim from the output
# of makepy.py when run with the -i parameter.
from win32com.client import gencache
gencache.EnsureModule('{00020813-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}', 0, 1, 2)

xl = win32com.client.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
print "The Excel object is", `xl`</pre>


<P>Note that you copied the output of <TT Class="monofont">makepy -i</tt>
verbatim into your source code.</p>



<p>Before running this code, remove the existing <a name="idx1124"></a>cache of
<i>.py</i> files. If you run this code with a
previously generated MakePy file for the Excel object, it won't
be created again. To delete the cache of <i>.py</i>
files, locate the
<i>Python\win32com\gen_py</i>
<a NAME="idx1125"></A> directory and delete it. You can
delete the entire directory or just the files in the directory. Be
sure to remove all files, not just the <I>.py</i>
files.</P>



<P>If you run this code, notice that a progress bar is displayed as the
<i>.py</I> file is generated, and this newly generated
module is used for the early-bound object. If you then run this code
a second time, notice you get the same output, but no generation
process; this demonstrates you can force late-bound objects to be
used, even when early-bound MakePy support exists for the
object.<A nAmE="idx1126"></A> <A Name="idx1127"></a></P>



<P>The output from this script should be:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">Creating late-bound Excel object
The Excel object is &lt;COMObject Excel.Application&gt;
Running makepy for Excel
The Excel object is &lt;win32com.gen_py.Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object 
    Library.Application&gt;</Pre>






<h4>12.3.4
Differences Between Early and Late Binding</h4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx1128"></a>
<a name="idx1129"></a>There are a number
of differences between using early and late binding within Python.
All these changes are specific to Python and not to COM itself. These
differences are most significant when moving from code that uses late
binding to code that uses early binding.</p>



<p>The key difference is the handling of <a name="idx1130"></a>parameters;
in fact, these differences are so significant that we discuss them
separately later in the section <a href="pythonwin32_snode95.html#13">Section 12.3.6</A>.</P>



<P>Another fundamental difference is <A NaME="idx1131"></a>case sensitivity. Late
binding is generally not sensitive to the case of methods and
properties, while early binding is. To see an example of this, create
a late-bound Excel object and adjust its
<TT cLaSS="monofont">Visible</TT>
<a namE="idx1132"></A> property. As discussed in the previous
section, you force a late-bound object even if MakePy support exists
for the object:</P>



<Pre clASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32com.client.dynamic
&gt;&gt;&gt; xl=win32com.client.dynamic.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
&gt;&gt;&gt; xl.Visible=1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print xl.VISIBLE
1
&gt;&gt;&gt;</Pre>


<p>You can use both <tT CLAss="monofont">Visible</tt> and
<tt class="monofont">VISIBLE</tt>
<a name="idx1133"></a> in this context.</p>



<p>Now let's try the same example using early bindings. Assume
that you have generated MakePy support for Microsoft Excel and use
the same code:</P>



<PRE CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32com.client
&gt;&gt;&gt; xl=win32com.client.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
&gt;&gt;&gt; xl.Visible=1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print xl.VISIBLE
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "c:\Program Files\Python\win32com\gen_py\00020813-0000-0000-C000-
000000000046x0x1x2.py", line 1462, in __getattr__
    raise AttributeError, attr
AttributeError: VISIBLE</pRE>


<p>Note that using <Tt CLASs="monofont">VISIBLE</tt> fails. The reason is
simple; when using late binding, Python asks Excel for a
<tT CLAss="monofont">Visible</tt> property and then for a
<TT CLass="monofont">VISIBLE</tT> property. Excel itself is
case-insensitive, so it happily indicates both properties are OK.
When using early binding, Python source code is generated, and all
property and method references are handled by Python itself. Because
Python is case-sensitive, it allows only the case that Excel reports
for the property—in this case <TT Class="monofont">Visible</tt>. When
the early-binding code attempts to use <tt class="monofont">VISIBLE</tt>,
Python raises the exception without consulting Excel.</p>







<h4>12.3.5
Using COM Constants</h4>


<p>Many <a nAME="idx1134"></A>COM type
libraries also include enumerations, which are named constants and
used with the type library. For example, the type library used with
Microsoft Excel includes constants named
<TT cLAsS="monofont">xlAscdending</Tt>, <Tt CLASs="monofont">xlDescending</tt>, and
so forth, and are used typically as parameters to (or return values
from) methods or properties.</p>



<P>These are made available from the Python object
<TT Class="monofont">win32com.client.constants</TT>
<A Name="idx1135"></a>, for example,
<TT CLass="monofont">win32com.client.constants.xlAscending</tt>.</p>



<p>It's important to note that the constants for a package
don't exist until the MakePy-generated module has been
imported; that is, until you create or use an object from the module.
You can see this in action if you start Python and attempt to
reference a constant from the Microsoft Excel type library:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; from win32com.client import constants, Dispatch
&gt;&gt;&gt; constants.xlAscending
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?

    raise AttributeError, a
AttributeError: xlAscending
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>You can see that attempting to use these constants results in an
attribute error. However, if you first create an
<tT CLASS="monofont">Excel.Application</tT> object, the constants become
available:</P>



<pRE cLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; xl=Dispatch("Excel.Application")
&gt;&gt;&gt; constants.xlAscending
1</PRe>


<p>Of course, because these constants are read from a type library, they
aren't available when you use late-bound (or
<a nAME="idx1136"></A>dynamic
dispatch) objects. In this case, you must use integer literals,
rather than named constants in your source code.</p>

<H4>12.3.6
Passing and Obtaining Python Objects from COM</h4>


<p>
<a nAME="idx1137"></A> <a name="idx1138"></a>COM supports a variety of argument
types, using the
<tt class="monofont">VARIANT</tt>
<a name="idx1139"></a>
<A NAME="idx1140"></A>
<a NAmE="idx1141"></A> data structure. The types that
can be passed to COM functions include integers and floats of various
sizes, strings, date/time values, COM objects, or arrays of any of
these types.</p>



<P>In many cases, PythonCOM can translate between Python objects and
<tT CLAss="monofont">VARIANT</tt> structures seamlessly. When you call a COM
object and pass a Python object, PythonCOM automatically creates a
<TT CLass="monofont">VARIANT</tT> of the right type and passes the
<TT Class="monofont">VARIANT</TT> to COM. In the absence of any hints,
PythonCOM performs the translations as listed in <A href="pythonwin32_snode95.html#16">Table 12.1</a> and <a href="pythonwin32_snode95.html#17">Table 12.2</a>. In <a href="pythonwin32_snode95.html#16">Table 12.1</a>, for example, you can see that a Python
integer is automatically converted to a <tt claSS="monofont">VARIANT</TT>
type <TT cLAsS="monofont">VT_I4</Tt>.</P>

<p>In some cases, these translations aren't suitable; for example,
a COM object may be picky about the <tt cLASS="monofont">VARIANT</tt> types
passed and accept only a <tt class="monofont">VT_I2</tt> integer, not a
<tt class="monofont">VT_I4</tt> integer. This should be considered a bug in
the COM object, but it does happen. In this case, you must use
early-bound COM by using MakePy. The code generated by MakePy
includes information about the types of parameters expected by the
COM object, and the PythonCOM framework correctly coerces the Python
object into the required <tT CLASS="monofont">VARIANT</tT> type. If you
can't use MakePy for your COM object, you must get your hands
dirty and use the <Tt CLaSs="monofont">PyIDispatch.InvokeTypes()</TT> method
manually; this is how MakePy gets the behavior it does. The use of
<TT clasS="monofont">InvokeTypes()</TT> is beyond the scope of this book.</P>



<p>Just as with the C and Visual Basic languages, it's possible in
COM to pass objects by value or by reference. Passing by value means
the value is passed, and changes to the value aren't reflected
in the calling object. Passing by reference means a pointer to the
value is passed, so changes to the value are reflected in the calling
object.</p>



<p>Python doesn't support this concept; it's not possible to
pass simple parameters by reference in Python. The common pattern is
for Python to return the values from the function.</p>



<P>Fortunately, parameters passed by reference tend to be avoided. The
Microsoft Office suite doesn't use them, nor do any of the
other type libraries you could reasonably assume are installed on
your PC. This makes demonstrating the problem using real code
somewhat difficult, but as an example, let's assume you need to
call a function that in C looks like:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">BOOL GetSize( int *left, int *right, int *top, int *bottom);</PRe>


<p>Your C code to call this function looks like this:</p>



<pre class="monofont">int left, right, top, bottom;
BOOL ok;
ok = GetSize( &amp;left, &amp;right, &amp;top, &amp;bottom);</pre>


<p>Or in Visual Basic, the code looks like:</p>



<pre clASS="monofont">Declare GetSize( ByRef left as integer, ByRef right as integer, _
                 ByRef top as integer, ByRef bottom as integer) as Integer
...
ok = GetSize(left, right, top, bottom);</PRE>


<p>In Python, the code looks something like:</P>



<PrE ClAsS="monofont">left, right, top, bottom = GetSize() # Exception indicates error.</PRE>


<p>Note that the output parameters have been converted to the function
result; the same style is used for PythonCOM. It's critical to
note, however, that <a naME="idx1142"></A>ByRef-style parameters may be
detected only when using early-bound dispatch. If you haven't
used MakePy for the type library, PythonCOM may not detect that the
parameters are indeed marked as by reference and therefore may not
work as expected.</P>



<p>The moral of the story is this: for anything other than simple
arguments, it's highly recommended you use MakePy to force
early-bound dispatch. If you have any problems with COM parameters
and aren't using MakePy, try switching to it, and your problem
is likely to go away.<a naME="idx1143"></A> <A name="idx1144"></A></P>
