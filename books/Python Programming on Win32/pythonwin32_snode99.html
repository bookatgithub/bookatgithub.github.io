<h3>12.7
Python and DCOM</h3>


<p>
<a NAME="idx1240"></a>Microsoft has recently enhanced COM to
support distributed objects. These enhancements are known as
distributed COM, or DCOM. The term <i>distributed
objects</i> refers to objects that operate on different
machines: a COM client and COM server may be on different parts of
the network.</p>



<P>There are a number of reasons why this may be appealing. It allows
you to host your objects close to your data; for example, on a server
with high-speed access to a database server. Microsoft also has a
product available called the <A NAme="idx1241"></a>
<a NAME="idx1242"></a>Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) that
provides additional facilities for large-scale distributed
applications. Alternatively, DCOM may allow you to use specific
hardware installed on a remote machine, by running on that machine
and controlling it from your own workstation.</p>



<p>One of the key strengths of the DCOM architecture is that in many
cases, the objects don't need to have special code to support
distributed objects. DCOM manages all this behind the scenes, and
neither the local or <a name="idx1243"></a>remote object need be aware they are not
running locally.</p>



<p>DCOM comes with a tool that allows you to configure the DCOM
characteristics of the local machine and of each specific object
registered on your machine. For each individual object, you can
specify the machine where that object should be executed. In
addition, the code that creates a new COM object (i.e., the COM
client) can specify its own settings by making slight changes to the
creation process.</p>



<p>To demonstrate DCOM, let's use the standard
<tt class="monofont">Python.Interpreter</tT> COM object and configure it to
be created on a remote machine. Here's the process:</P>



<OL TYpE="1">
<Li><P>Configure DCOM on the remote machine.</P>
</lI>
<lI><P>Configure DCOM and our object on the local machine.</P>
</Li>
<li><p>Test the remote object using normal COM.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>Test the remote object using DCOM-specific calls.</p>
</lI>
</OL>


<H4>12.7.1
Configure DCOM on the Remote Machine</h4>


<p>
<a nAME="idx1244"></A>The first step is to configure
DCOM on the remote machine, where the object will actually run.</p>



<p>To configure DCOM, start the DCOM configuration tool by selecting the
Run option from the Windows start menu, and enter
<tt class="monofont">dcomcnfg</tt>. The mail display is shown in <a href="pythonwin32_snode99.html#3">Figure 12.4</a>.</p>

<p>Now select the Default Properties tab and ensure that DCOM is enabled
for this computer, as shown in <a href="pythonwin32_snode99.html#4">Figure 12.5</a>.</p>



<center>

<P>No additional configuration options are required on the remote
machine, but you do need to ensure the COM object itself is installed
on this computer. There's nothing special about registering
your object for DCOM; perform a normal registration process for the
object, as described in the previous section <A href="pythonwin32_snode98.html#4">Section 12.6.2</A>.</P>



<P>The <Tt class="monofont">Python.Interpreter</tt> object you use is part of
the standard Python COM distribution, so it should have been
registered when the Python COM extensions were installed. However, it
can't hurt to reregister it. To register the
<tt class="monofont">Python.Interpreter</tt> object, perform the following
steps on the remote machine:</p>



<ol tYPE="1">
<LI><P>Start PythonWin.</p>
</LI>
<lI><P>Select File <iMg BORDer="0" alIGN="absmiddle" Width="20" HEIGht="16" src="FILES/U2192.gif" ALT="figs/U2192.gif"> Run, select the Browse button, and locate the file
<i>win32com\servers\interp.py</i>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select OK.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The PythonWin window should report:</p>



<pre claSS="monofont">Registering COM server...
Registered: Python.Interpreter</PRE>






<H4>12.7.2
Configure DCOM and the Object on the Local Machine</h4>


<P>
<A nAMe="idx1245"></A>The next step is to configure your
local machine, where you actually create and use the object running
on the remote machine.</p>



<P>First, ensure the object is registered on the local machine; although
you don't need to start the object on this local machine, the
object must be registered locally so the COM and DCOM architecture
know about the object and how to redirect it. To register the object
locally, perform the same process you did for registering the object
on the remote machine.</P>



<P>Now start the DCOM configuration tool to configure the object on the
local machine. Use the same process you used to start the tool on the
remote machine, but this time at the local machine.</P>



<p>The same initial dialog in <a href="pythonwin32_snode99.html#3">Figure 12.4</A> is displayed.
Locate the <Tt claSS="monofont">Python.Interpreter</TT> object in the list
and select the Properties button. The default properties for the
object should look something like <a href="pythonwin32_snode99.html#7">Figure 12.6</A>.</P>

<P>If you select the Location tab, you see the available options. The
default setting should indicate that the application runs only on
this computer. Disable the local computer option and enable the
"Run application on the following computer" setting. The
remote computer is named <I>SKIPPY</I>. Now enter the
name of your remote machine. The dialog should now look something
like <a href="pythonwin32_snode99.html#8">Figure 12.7</A>.</P>

<H5>12.7.2.1
Testing the object using normal COM</h5>


<p>
<a nAME="idx1246"></A>Before testing, there is a slight
complication that needs to be addressed. If you recall the discussion
at the beginning of the chapter regarding <tt clASS="monofont">InProc</Tt>,
<tt cLASS="monofont">LocalServer</tt>, and <tt class="monofont">RemoteServer</tt>
objects, it should come as no surprise that remote DCOM objects must
be hosted by an executable. It's not possible to use an object
implemented in a DLL, since the object is running on a different
computer than the user of the object, so it must be in a different
process. This is not a problem, since by default all Python COM
objects are registered with both executable and DLL support.</p>



<p>The complication is on the local machine. Although you configured
DCOM not to run the object on the local computer, this applies only
to <tt class="monofont">LocalServer</tT>
<A NAME="idx1247"></a> objects. If there is an
<TT cLAsS="monofont">InProc</tT>
<A NAme="idx1248"></a> object registered locally, this object
is used regardless of the DCOM settings. As your object is registered
on the local machine as an <tT CLAss="monofont">InProc</tt> application, you
need to take action to ensure this version of the object isn't
loaded.</P>



<P>It's worth noting that this complication is provided courtesy
of COM and DCOM. There is nothing Python-specific about this problem;
it exists for all COM objects regardless of their implementation
language. Python is slightly unique in that the default registration
for its objects are for both <TT clasS="monofont">LocalServer</TT> and
<Tt class="monofont">InProc</tt>; most languages force you to choose one or
another quite early in the development process. There are two ways to
solve this dilemma:</p>



<ul>
<li><p>Modify the COM object so it supports only
<tt class="monofont">LocalServer</TT> operations by setting the
<TT CLaSS="monofont">_reg_clsctx_</tT> attribute in the class. See the
earlier section <A href="pythonwin32_snode98.html#4">Section 12.6.2</A> for more details.</P>
</Li>
<li><p>Make a slight change to the object creation code to explicitly
exclude the <TT CLass="monofont">InProc</tT> version of the object from
being used.</P>
</LI>
</ul>
<p>Because we are using the existing
<tT CLAss="monofont">Python.Interpreter</tt> example, we won't modify
the it, but will go for the second option. You do this by specifying
the <tt class="monofont">clsctx</tt> parameter to the
<tt class="monofont">win32com.client.Dispatch()</tT> function. If you decide
to change your COM object to support only
<TT CLAsS="monofont">LocalServer</Tt> operations, this step isn't
necessary, and the object creation code is identical to the normal
object creation process.</P>



<P>
<a NaME="idx1249"></A>To execute the object remotely, start
Python or PythonWin on the local computer. First, let's prove
the name of the local machine:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import win32api
&gt;&gt;&gt; win32api.GetComputerName()
'BOBCAT'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>Now, let's create a <TT CLass="monofont">Python.Interpreter</tT>
object. As discussed, you pass a custom <TT Class="monofont">clsctx</tt>
parameter to the <tt class="monofont">Dispatch()</tt> function. Because the
<tt clasS="monofont">clsctx</TT> parameter is not the second parameter,
specify it by name:</P>



<PRe CLaSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; import pythoncom, win32com.client
&gt;&gt;&gt; clsctx=pythoncom.CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER
&gt;&gt;&gt; i=win32com.client.Dispatch("Python.Interpreter", clsctx=clsctx)
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pRe>


<P>Now, let's use this object. Ask it to report what machine it is
on. Then ask the remote interpreter to import the
<TT Class="monofont">win32api</TT> module and print the value of
<TT clasS="monofont">win32api.GetComputerName()</TT>. Because the object is
running remotely, expect to see the name of the remote computer:</P>



<pre cLASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; i.Exec("import win32api")
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.Eval("win32api.GetComputerName()")
'SKIPPY'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>


<p>If you view the Task Manager for the remote machine, notice a new
process <i>pythonw.exe</i>. This is the
process hosting the <a name="idx1250"></a>remote object. If you release the
reference to the object, you should see the process terminate. To
release the reference, execute:</p>



<pre class="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; i=None
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<P>And within a few seconds the process on the remote server terminates.</P>



<P>As you can see, it worked! Setting up the machines for DCOM is quite
painless, and using the remote object is as simple as if it were a
local object.<a NAmE="idx1251"></A></p>








<H4>12.7.3
Testing a Remote Object Using DCOM-Specific Calls</h4>


<P>
<A NAme="idx1252"></a>
<a NAME="idx1253"></a>You may
have noticed that the DCOM configuration dialog states "Client
applications may override your selection." So when you
configure DCOM, you really just provide default values for
non-DCOM-aware programs. In fact, if you want to make your client
code DCOM-aware, it isn't necessary to configure DCOM on the
local machine at all; your client code provides the information
needed.</p>



<p>To demonstrate this, let's restore the DCOM configuration on
the local machine to the defaults. Restart the DCOM configuration
tool and again select the <tT CLAss="monofont">Python.Interpreter</tt>
object. Select the Location tab and restore the settings to how you
first found them. The dialog should look similar to <A href="pythonwin32_snode99.html#11">Figure 12.8</a>.</p>



<center>
<h5>
<a name="11"></a>Figure 12.8. Back to the default DCOM configuration for the object</h5>

<img bORDER="0" WiDTh="502" HEiGhT="259" src="FILES/ppw.1208.gif" alt="figs/ppw.1208.gif"></cENTEr>


<p>Select the OK button to apply the changes.</p>



<p>First, let's check that the object is indeed restored
correctly. Execute the same lines of code used previously, but
because the DCOM configuration has been restored, the object should
be local:</P>



<PRE clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; i=win32com.client.Dispatch("Python.Interpreter", clsctx=clsctx)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.Exec("import win32api")
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.Eval("win32api.GetComputerName()")
'BOBCAT'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRE>


<p>As expected, the local machine name is now being used, and you should
be able to locate a <i>pythonw.exe</i> process running
on the local computer.</p>



<p>The <tt class="monofont">win32com.client.DispatchEx()</tt> function allows
you to override the DCOM defaults for your object.</p>



<p>The first parameter to <tt claSS="monofont">DispatchEx()</TT> is the ProgID
for the object you wish to create, the same ProgID you would pass to
<TT cLAsS="monofont">Dispatch()</Tt>. The second parameter is the name of
the machine to create the object on. If the machine name isn't
specified, the call operates identically to
<Tt CLASs="monofont">win32com.client.Dispatch()</tt>.</p>



<P>Let's test drive this function. Although the DCOM configuration
for the local machine is set up to run locally, use the following
code to force a remote server:</P>



<PRe claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;&gt; i=win32com.client.DispatchEx("Python.Interpreter", "skippy", clsctx=clsctx)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.Exec("import win32api")
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.Eval("win32api.GetComputerName()")
'SKIPPY'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</PRe>


<p>Note that the same <tt CLASs="monofont">clsctx</tt> complications exist
here. If the object is registered as an <tt class="monofont">InProc</tt>
server locally, all DCOM settings (including the explicit machine
name) are ignored.<a name="idx1254"></a></p>
