Colophon








<P class="docText">Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</P>

<P class="docText">The animals on the cover of <span class="docEmphasis">Python Standard Library</span> are harvest
mice. Many species of harvest mice populate North American grasslands
and marshes, while only one species-Micromys minutus, the Old World
harvest mouse-resides in the grasslands and farmlands of Europe and
Asia.</P>


<P class="docText">Smaller than the common house mouse, the harvest mouse sports
prominent ears and a very long hairy tail, and its hind feet have an
opposable fifth toe for grasping and climbing stems. Behaviorally,
harvest mice set themselves apart from other mice species by building
breeding nests suspended in high grasses. These nests are
baseball-sized globes of woven grass with small entrance holes and are
lined with soft plant material, such as dandelion fluff, to keep the
young warm. The young are born in litters of three to six, completely
dependent on the mother (the father is not allowed in the nest). By
the time they are five weeks old, however, they are independent and
sexually mature. Overall, harvest mice typically live for six to
eighteen months in the wild-enough time for a female to produce one to
six litters in her lifetime. These numbers are much higher for mice in
captivity.</P>


<P class="docText">The harvest mouse is a "cover dependent" species, as it relies
on brush and vegetation to hide its small, brown body from predators
as it forages for seeds and insect larvae. It moves slowly and adopts
a still "camouflage posture" as further defense; overall, it is much
more calm than the common house mouse.</P>


<P class="docText">The Western, Eastern, and Fulvous harvest mice (<span class="docEmphasis">Reithrodontomys
megalotis</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">Reithrodontomys humulis</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">Reithrodontomys fulvescens</span>,
respectively) currently populate various regions of the United States
and Canada with relative success, challenged somewhat by habitat loss
due to crop farming, cattle grazing, and urbanization. However, their
cousin the Saltmarsh harvest mouse (<span class="docEmphasis">Reithrodontomys raviventris</span>)
suffers severe threat due to the filling in of its dwindling marshland
home in the San Francisco Bay Area. The only endangered harvest mouse
species, its members number in only the hundreds to the few
thousands.</P>


<P class="docText">Catherine Morris was the production editor and proofreader, and
Linley Dolby was the copyeditor for <span class="docEmphasis">Python Standard Library</span>. Emily
Quill, Matt Hutchinson, and Claire Cloutier provided quality
control. Joe Wizda wrote the index. Interior composition was done by
Gabe Weiss, Matt Hutchinson, and Catherine Morris.</P> 


<P class="docText">Hanna Dyer designed the cover of this book, based on a series
design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is a 19th-century engraving
from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby produced the cover layout
with Quark&#8482;XPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font. Emma
Colby also designed the CD label.</P>

<P class="docText">David Futato designed the interior layout based on a series design by Nancy Priest. The print version of this book was created by translating the DocBook SGML markup of its source files into a set of gtroff macros using a filter developed at O'Reilly &amp; Associates by Norman Walsh. Steve Talbott designed and wrote the underlying macro set on the basis of the GNU troff -gs macros; Lenny Muellner adapted them to SGML and implemented the book design. The GNU groff text formatter Version 1.11.1 was used to generate PostScript output. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book; the code font is Constant Willison. This colophon was written by Sarah Jane Shangraw.</P>



























<P class="docText">The online edition of this book was created by the Safari
production group (John Chodacki, Becki Maisch, and Madeleine Newell)
using a set of Frame-to-XML conversion and cleanup tools written and
maintained by Erik Ray, Benn Salter, John Chodacki, and Jeff
Liggett.</P>
