<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-1-ITERM-3456"></A>Python is
a general-purpose programming language. It has been around for quite
a while: Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, started
developing Python back in 1990. This stable and mature language is
very high level, dynamic, object-oriented, and
cross-platform—all characteristics that are very attractive to
developers. Python runs on all major hardware platforms and operating
systems, so it doesn't constrain your platform
choices.</P>

<P class="docText">Python offers high productivity for all phases of the software life
cycle: analysis, design, prototyping, coding, testing, debugging,
tuning, documentation, deployment, and, of course, maintenance.
Python's popularity has seen steady, unflagging
growth over the years. Today, familiarity with Python is an advantage
for every programmer, as Python is likely to have some useful role to
play as a part of any software solution.</P>

<P class="docText">Python provides a unique mix of elegance, simplicity, and power.
You'll quickly become productive with Python, thanks
to its consistency and regularity, its rich standard library, and the
many other modules that are readily available for it. Python is easy
to learn, so it is quite suitable if you are new to programming, yet
at the same time it is powerful enough for the most sophisticated
expert.</P>
