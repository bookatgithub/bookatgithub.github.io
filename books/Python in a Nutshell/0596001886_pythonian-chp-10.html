<H2 class="docChapterTitle">Chapter 10. File and Text Operations</H2>


<P class="docText">This chapter covers dealing with files and the filesystem in Python.
A <span class="docEmphasis">file</span> is a stream of bytes that a program can
read and/or write, while a <span class="docEmphasis">filesystem</span> is a
hierarchical repository of files on a particular computer system.
Because files are such a core programming concept, several other
chapters also contain material about handling files of specific
kinds.<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-10-ITERM-5375"></A>
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-10-ITERM-5376"></A></P>

<P class="docText">In Python, the <TT>os</TT> module supplies many of the
functions that operate on the filesystem, so this chapter starts by
introducing the <TT>os</TT> module. The chapter then
proceeds to cover operations on the filesystem, including comparing,
copying, and deleting directories and files, working with file paths,
and accessing low-level file descriptors.</P>

<P class="docText">Next, this chapter discusses the typical ways Python programs read
and write data, via built-in file objects and the polymorphic concept
of file-like objects (i.e., objects that are not files, but still
behave to some extent like files). Python file objects directly
support the concept of <span class="docEmphasis">text</span>
<span class="docEmphasis">files</span>, which are streams of characters encoded
as bytes. The chapter also covers Python's support
for data in compressed form, such as archives in the popular ZIP
format.<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-10-ITERM-5377"></A>
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-10-ITERM-5378"></A></P>

<P class="docText">While many modern programs rely on a graphical user interface (GUI),
text-based, non-graphical user interfaces are often still useful, as
they are simple, fast to program, and lightweight. This chapter
concludes with material about text input and output in Python,
including information about presenting text that is understandable to
different users, no matter where they are or what language they
speak. This is known as <span class="docEmphasis">internationalization</span>
(often abbreviated
<span class="docEmphasis">i18n</span>).<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-10-ITERM-5379"></A></P>
