<P class="docText">You're not finished with a programming task when
you're done writing the code:
you're finished when your code is running correctly
and with acceptable performance. <I>Testing</I> means
verifying that your code is running correctly by exercising the code
under known conditions and checking that the results are as expected.
<I>Debugging</I> means discovering the causes of
incorrect behavior and removing them (the removal is often easy once
you have figured out the causes).

<P class="docText"><I>Optimizing</I> is often used as an umbrella term for
activities meant to ensure acceptable performance. Optimizing breaks
down into <I>benchmarking</I> (measuring performance
for given tasks and checking that it's within
acceptable bounds), <I>profiling</I> (instrumenting the
program to find out what parts are performance bottlenecks), and
optimizing proper (removing bottlenecks to make overall program
performance acceptable). Clearly, you can't remove
performance bottlenecks until you've found out where
they are (using profiling), which in turn requires knowing that there
<span class="docEmphasis">are</span> performance problems (using benchmarking).</P>

<P class="docText">All of these tasks are large and important, and each could fill a
book by itself. This chapter does not explore every related technique
and implication; it focuses on Python-specific techniques,
approaches, and tools.</P>
