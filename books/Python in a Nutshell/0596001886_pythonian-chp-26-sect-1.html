<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9463"></A>The <TT>distutils</TT> are
a rich and flexible set of tools to package Python programs and
extensions for distribution to third parties. I cover typical, simple
use of the <TT>distutils</TT> for the most common packaging
needs. For in-depth, highly detailed discussion of
<TT>distutils</TT>, I recommend two manuals that are part
of Python's online documentation:
<span class="docEmphasis">Distributing Python Modules</span> (available at
<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/current/dist/default.htm">http://www.python.org/doc/current/dist/</A>), and
<span class="docEmphasis">Installing Python Modules</span> (available at
<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/default.htm">http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/</A>),
both by Greg Ward, the principal author of the
<TT>distutils</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9464"></A>A <I>distribution</I>
is the set of files to package into a single file for distribution
purposes. A di
stribution may include zero, one, or more Python
packages and other Python modules (as covered in <A class="docLink" HREF="0596001886_pythonian-chp-7.html#pythonian-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A>), as well as, optionally, Python scripts,
C-coded (and other) extensions, supporting data files, and auxiliary
files containing metadata about the distribution itself. A
distribution is said to be <I>pure</I> if all code it
includes is Python, and <I>non-pure</I> if it also
includes non-Python code (most often, C-coded
extensions).<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9465"></A>

<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9469"></A>
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9470"></A>You should
normally place all the files of a distribution in a directory, known
as the <span class="docEmphasis">distribution root directory</span>, and in
subdirectories of the distribution root. Mostly, you can arrange the
subtree of files and directories rooted at the distribution root to
suit your own organizational needs. However, remember from <A class="docLink" HREF="0596001886_pythonian-chp-7.html#pythonian-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A> that a Python package must reside in its own
directory, and a package's directory must contain a
file named <I>_ _init_ _.py</I> (or subdirectories with
<I>_ _init_ _.py</I> files, for subpackages) as well as
other modules belonging to that
package.<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9471"></A> <A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9472"></A></P>

<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9474"></A>
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9475"></A>The distribution root directory must
contain a Python script that by convention is named
<I>setup.py</I>. The <I>setup.py</I>
script can, in theory, contain arbitrary Python code. However, in
practice, <I>setup.py </I>always boils down to some
variation of:</P>

<PRE>from distutils.core import setup, Extension

setup( <TT><I>many keyword arguments go here</I></TT> )</PRE>

<P class="docText">All the action is in the parameters you supply in the call to
<TT>setup</TT>. You should not import
<TT>Extension</TT> if your <I>setup.py</I>
deals with a pure distribution. <TT>Extension</TT> is
needed only for non-pure distributions, and you should import it only
when you need it. It is fine to have a few statements before the call
to <TT>setup</TT>, in order to arrange
<TT>setup</TT>'s arguments in clearer and
more readable ways than could be managed by having everything inline
as part of the <TT>setup</TT> call.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>distutils.core.setup</TT> function accepts only
keyword arguments, and there are a large number of such arguments
that you could potentially supply. A few deal with the internal
operations of the <TT>distutils</TT> themselves, and you
never supply such arguments unless you are extending or debugging the
<TT>distutils</TT>, an advanced subject that I do not cover
in this book. Other keyword arguments to <TT>setup</TT>
fall into two groups: metadata about the distribution, and
information about what files are in the distribution.</P>

<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9478"></A>You should provide metadata about the
distribution by supplying some of the following keyword arguments
when you call the <TT>distutils.core.setup</TT> function.
The value you associate with each argument name you supply is a
string that is intended mostly to be human-readable; therefore, any
specifications about the string's format are just
advisory. The explanations and recommendations about the metadata
fields in the following are also non-normative, and correspond only
to common, not universal, conventions. Whenever the following
explanations refer to "this
distribution," it can be taken to refer to the
material included in the distribution, rather than to the packaging
of the distribution.</P>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9493"></A>A distribution can contain a mix of
Python source files, C-coded extensions, and other files.
<TT>setup</TT> accepts optional keyword arguments detailing
files to put in the distribution. Whenever you specify file paths,
the paths must be relative to the distribution root directory and use
<TT>/</TT> as the path separator.
<TT>distutils</TT> adapts location and separator
appropriately when it installs the distribution. Note, however, that
the keyword arguments <TT>packages</TT> and
<TT>py_modules</TT> do not list file paths, but rather
Python packages and modules respectively. Therefore, in the values of
these keyword arguments, use no path separators or file extensions.
When you list subpackage names in argument
<TT>packages</TT>, use Python syntax (e.g.,
<TT><I>top_package</I></TT>.<TT><I>sub_package</I></TT>).</P>

the distribution root directory, and for Python packages (which you
list in the value of the keyword argument
<TT>packages</TT>) as sub-directories of the distribution
root directory. You may specify keyword argument
<TT>package_dir</TT> to change these defaults. However,

<H4 class="docSection2Title">26.1.7 Creating Prebuilt Distributions with distutils</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9518"></A>
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9519"></A>The packaged
source distributions you create with <TT>python</TT>
<TT>setup.py</TT> <TT>sdist</TT> are the most
widely useful files you can produce with
<TT>distutils</TT>. However, you can make life even easier
for users with specific platforms by also creating prebuilt forms of
your distribution with the command <TT>python</TT>
<TT>setup.py</TT> <TT>bdist</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">For a pure distribution, supplying prebuilt forms is merely a matter
of convenience for the users. You can create prebuilt pure
distributions for any platform, including ones different from those
on which you work, as long as you have available on your path the
needed commands (such as <I>zip</I>,
<I>gzip</I>, <I>bzip2</I>, and
<I>tar</I>). Such commands are freely available on the
Net for all sorts of platforms, so you can easily stock up on them in
order to provide maximum convenience to users who want to install
your distribution.</P>

<P class="docText">For a non-pure distribution, making prebuilt forms available may be
more than just an issue of convenience. A non-pure distribution, by
definition, includes code that is not pure Python, generally C code.
Unless you supply a prebuilt form, users need to have the appropriate
C compiler installed in order to build and install your distribution.
This is not a terrible problem on platforms where the appropriate C
compiler is the free and ubiquitous <I>gcc</I>.
However, on other platforms, the C compiler needed for normal
building of Python extensions is commercial and costly. For example,
on Windows, the normal C compiler used by Python and its C-coded
extensions is Microsoft Visual C++ (Release 6, at the time of this
writing). It is possible to substitute other compilers, including
free ones such as the <I>mingw32</I> and
<I>cygwin </I>versions of <I>gcc</I>, and
Borland C++ 5.5, whose command-line version you can download from the
Net at no cost. However, the process of using such alternative
compilers, as documented in the Python online manuals, is rather
complex and intricate, particularly for end users who may not be
experienced programmers.</P>

<P class="docText">Therefore, if you want your non-pure distribution to be widely
adopted on such platforms as Windows, it's highly
advisable to make your distribution also available in prebuilt form.
However, unless you have developed or purchased advanced
cross-compilation environments, building a non-pure distribution and
packaging it up in prebuilt form is only feasible on the target
platform. You also need to have the necessary C compiler installed.
When those conditions are satisfied, however, the
<TT>distutils</TT> make the procedure quite simple. In
particular, the command:</P>

<PRE>python setup.py bdist_wininst</PRE>

<P class="docText">creates an <I>.exe</I> file that is a Windows installer
for your distribution. If your distribution is non-pure, the prebuilt
distribution is dependent on the specific Python version. The
<TT>distutils</TT> reflect this fact in the name of the
<I>.exe</I> installer they create for you. Say, for
example, that your distribution's
<TT>name</TT> metadata is <TT>mydist</TT>, your
distribution's <TT>version</TT> metadata
is <TT>0.1</TT>, and the Python version you use is
<TT>2.2</TT>. In this case, the
<TT>distutils</TT> build a Windows installer named
<I>mydist-0.1.win32-py2.2.exe</I>.<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9520"></A></P>
