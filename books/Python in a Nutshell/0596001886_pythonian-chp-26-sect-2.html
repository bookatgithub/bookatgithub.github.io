<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-26-ITERM-9522"></A>The <TT>distutils</TT> help you
package up your Python extensions and applications. However, an end
user can install the resulting packaged form only after installing
Python. This is particularly a problem on Windows, where end users
want to run a single installer to get an application working on their
machine. Installing Python first and then running your
application's installer may prove too much of a
hassle for such end users.</P>

<P class="docText">Thomas Heller has developed a simple solution, a
<TT>distutils</TT> add-on named <TT>py2exe</TT>,
freely available for download from <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/default.htm">http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/</A>.
This URL also contains detailed documentation of
<TT>py2exe</TT>, and I recommend that you study that
documentation if you intend to use <TT>py2exe</TT> in
advanced ways. However, the simplest kinds of use, which I cover in
the rest of this section, cover most practical needs.</P>

<P class="docText">After downloading and installing <TT>py2exe</TT> (on a
Windows machine where Microsoft Visual C++ 6 is also installed), you
just need to add the line:</P>

<PRE>import py2exe</PRE>

<P class="docText">at the start of your otherwise normal <TT>distutils</TT>
script <I>setup.py</I>. Now, in addition to other
<TT>distutils</TT> commands, you have one more option.
Running:</P>

<PRE>python setup.py py2exe</PRE>

<P class="docText">builds and collects in a subdirectory of your distribution root
directory an <I>.exe</I> file and one or more
<I>.dll</I> files. If your
distribution's <TT>name</TT> metadata is,
for example, <TT>myapp</TT>, then the directory into which
the <I>.exe</I> and <I>.dll</I> files are
collected is named
<I>dist\myapp</I><span class="docEmphasis">\</span>. Any files
specified by option <TT>data_files</TT> in your
<I>setup.py</I> script are placed in subdirectories of
<I>dist\myapp</I><span class="docEmphasis">\</span>. The
<I>.exe</I> file corresponds to your
application's first or single entry in the
<TT>scripts</TT> keyword argument value, and also contains
the bytecode-compiled form of all Python modules and packages that
your <I>setup.py</I> specifies or implies. Among the
<I>.dll</I> files is, at minimum, the Python dynamic
load library, for example <I>python22.dll </I>if you
use Python 2.2, plus any other <I>.pyd </I>or
<I>.dll </I>files that your application needs,
excluding <I>.dll</I> files that
<TT>py2exe</TT> knows are system files (i.e., guaranteed to
be available on any Windows installation).</P>

<P class="docText"><TT>py2exe</TT> provides no direct means to collect the
contents of the <I>dist\myapp\</I> directory for easy
distribution and installation. You have several options, ranging from
a <I>.zip</I> file (which may be given an
<I>.exe</I> extension and made self-extracting, in ways
that vary depending on the .<I>zip</I> file handling
tools you choose), all the way to a professional Windows installer
construction system, such as those sold by companies such as Wise and
InstallShield. One option that is particularly worth considering is
Inno Setup, a free, professional-quality installer construction
system (see <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php</A>). Since
the files to be packaged up for end user installation are an
<I>.exe</I> file, one or more <I>.dll</I>
files, and perhaps some data files in subdirectories, the issue
becomes totally independent from Python. You may package up and
redistribute such files just as if they had originally been built
from sources written in any other programming language.</P>
