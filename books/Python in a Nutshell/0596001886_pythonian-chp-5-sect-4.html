<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4538"></A>Any
object, even a class object, has a type. In Python, types and classes
are also first-class objects. The type of a class object is also
known as the class's
<I>metaclass</I>.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#pythonian-CHP-5-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> An object's
behavior is determined largely by the type of the object. This also
holds for classes: a class's behavior is determined
largely by the class's metaclass. Metaclasses are an
advanced subject, and you may want to skip the rest of this chapter
on first reading. However, fully grasping metaclasses can help you
obtain a deeper understanding of Python, and sometimes it can even be
useful to define your own custom metaclasses.
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4539"></A> 
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4540"></A></P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> Strictly speaking,
the type of a class <TT><I>C</I></TT> could be said to be
the metaclass only of instances of <TT><I>C</I></TT>,
rather than of <TT><I>C</I></TT> itself, but this
exceedingly subtle terminological distinction is rarely, if ever,
observed in practice.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">The distinction between classic and new-style classes relies on the
fact that each class's behavior is determined by its
metaclass. In other words, the reason classic classes behave
differently from new-style classes is that classic and new-style
classes are object of different types (metaclasses):</P>

<PRE>class Classic: pass
class Newstyle(object): pass
print type(Classic)                  # prints: &lt;type 'class'&gt;
print type(Newstyle)                 # prints: &lt;type 'type'&gt;</PRE>

<P class="docText">The type of <TT>Classic</TT> is object
<TT>types.ClassType</TT> from standard module
<TT>types</TT>, while the type of
<TT>Newstyle</TT> is built-in object
<TT>type</TT>. <TT>type</TT> is also the
metaclass of all Python built-in types, including itself (i.e.,
<TT>print</TT> <TT>type(type)</TT> also prints
<TT>&lt;type</TT> '<TT>type'&gt;</TT>).</P>

<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-SECT-4.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.4.1 How Python Determines a Class's Metaclass</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4541"></A>
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4542"></A>To execute a
<TT>class</TT> statement, Python first collects the base
classes into a tuple <TT><I>t</I></TT> (an empty one, if
there are no base classes) and executes the class body in a temporary
dictionary <TT><I>d</I></TT>. Then, Python determines the
metaclass <TT><I>M</I></TT> to use for the new class
object <TT><I>C</I></TT> created by the
<TT>class</TT> statement.</P>

<P class="docText">When '<TT>_ _metaclass_ _</TT>' is a key in
<TT><I>d</I></TT>, <TT><I>M</I></TT> is
<TT><I>d</I></TT><TT>['_ _metaclass_ _']</TT>.
Thus, you can explicitly control class
<TT><I>C</I></TT>'s metaclass by binding
the attribute <TT>_ _metaclass_ _</TT> in
<TT><I>C</I></TT>'s class body.
Otherwise, when <TT><I>t</I></TT> is non-empty (i.e., when
<TT><I>C</I></TT> has one or more base classes),
<TT><I>M</I></TT> is
<TT>type(</TT><TT><I>t</I></TT><TT>[0])</TT>,
the metaclass of <TT><I>C</I></TT>'s
first base class. This is why inheriting from
<TT>object</TT> indicates that <TT><I>C</I></TT>
is a new-style class. Since <TT>type(object)</TT> is
<TT>type</TT>, a class <TT><I>C</I></TT> that
inherits from <TT>object</TT> (or some other built-in type)
gets the same metaclass as <TT>object</TT> (i.e.,
<TT>type(</TT><TT><I>C</I></TT><TT>)</TT>,
<TT><I>C</I></TT>'s metaclass, is also
<TT>type</TT>) Thus, being a new-style class is synonymous
with having <TT>type</TT> as the metaclass.</P>

<P class="docText">When <TT><I>C</I></TT> has no base classes, but the
current module has a global variable named <TT>_ _metaclass_
_</TT>, <TT><I>M</I></TT> is the value of that global
variable. This lets you make classes without base classes default to
new-style classes, rather than classic classes, throughout a module.
Just place the following statement toward the start of the module
body:</P>

<PRE>_ _metaclass_ = type</PRE>

<P class="docText">Failing all of these, in Python 2.2 and 2.3,
<TT><I>M</I></TT> defaults to
<TT>types.ClassType</TT>. This last default of defaults
clause is why classes without base classes are classic classes by
default, when <TT>_ _metaclass_ _</TT> is not bound in the
class body or as a global variable of the module.</P>


<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-SECT-4.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.4.2 How a Metaclass Creates a Class</H4>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4543"></A>Having determined
<TT><I>M</I></TT>, Python calls
<TT><I>M</I></TT> with three arguments: the class name (a
string), the tuple of base classes <TT><I>t</I></TT>, and
the dictionary <TT><I>d</I></TT>. The call returns the
class object <TT><I>C</I></TT>, which Python then binds to
the class name, completing the execution of the
<TT>class</TT> statement. Note that this is in fact an
instantiation of type <TT><I>M</I></TT>, so the call to
<TT><I>M</I></TT> executes
<TT><I>M</I></TT><TT>._ _init_
_(</TT><TT><I>C</I></TT>,<TT><I>namestring</I></TT>,<TT><I>t</I></TT>,<TT><I>d</I></TT><TT>)</TT>,
where <TT><I>C</I></TT> is the return value of
<TT><I>M</I></TT><TT>._ _new_
_(</TT><TT><I>M</I></TT>,<TT><I>namestring</I></TT>,<TT><I>t</I></TT>,<TT><I>d</I></TT><TT>)</TT>,
just as in any other similar instantiation of a new-style class (or
built-in type).</P>

<P class="docText">After class object <TT><I>C</I></TT> is created, the
relationship between class <TT><I>C</I></TT> and its type
(<TT>type(</TT><TT><I>C</I></TT><TT>)</TT>,
normally <TT><I>M</I></TT>) is the same as that between
any object and its type. For example, when you call class
<TT><I>C</I></TT> (to create an instance of
<TT><I>C</I></TT>),
<TT><I>M</I></TT><TT>._ _call_ _</TT> executes,
with class object <TT><I>C</I></TT> as the first actual
argument.</P>

<P class="docText">Note the benefit of the new-style approach described in
<A class="docLink" HREF="0596001886_pythonian-chp-5-sect-2.html#pythonian-CHP-5-SECT-2.4.4">Section 5.2.4.4</A> earlier in this
chapter. Calling <TT><I>C</I></TT> to instantiate it must
execute the metaclass's
<TT><I>M</I></TT><TT>._ _call_ _</TT>, whether
or not <TT><I>C</I></TT> has a per-instance attribute
(method) <TT>_ _call_ _</TT> (i.e., independently of
whether instances of <TT><I>C</I></TT> are or
aren't callable). This requirement is simply
incompatible with the classic object model, where per-instance
methods override per-class ones—even for implicitly called
special methods. The new-style approach avoids having to make the
relationship between a class and its metaclass an ad hoc special
case. Avoiding ad hoc special cases is a key to
Python's power: Python has few, simple, general
rules, and applies them consistently.</P>

<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-SECT-4.2.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">5.4.2.1 Defining and using your own metaclasses</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4544"></A>
<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4545"></A>It's
easy to define metaclasses in Python 2.2 and later, by inheriting
from <TT>type</TT> and overriding some methods. You can
also perform most of these tasks with <TT>_ _new_ _</TT>,
<TT>_ _init_ _</TT>, <TT>_ _getattribute_ _</TT>,
and so on, without involving metaclasses. However, a custom metaclass
can be faster, since special processing is done only at class
creation time, which is a rare operation. A custom metaclass also
lets you define a whole category of classes in a framework that
magically acquires whatever interesting behavior
you've coded, quite independently of what special
methods the classes may choose to define. Moreover, some behavior of
class objects can be customized only in metaclasses. The following
example shows how to use a metaclass to change the string format of
class objects:</P>

<PRE>class MyMeta(type):
    def _ _str_ _(cls): return "Beautiful class '%s'"%cls._ _name_ _
class MyClass:
    _ _metaclass_ _ = MyMeta
x = MyClass(  )
print type(x)</PRE>

<P class="docText">Strictly speaking, classes that instantiate your own custom metaclass
are neither classic nor new-style: the semantics of classes and of
their instances is entirely defined by their metaclass. In practice,
your custom metaclasses will almost invariably subclass built-in
<TT>type</TT>. Therefore, the semantics of the classes that
instantiate them are best thought of as secondary variations with
respect to the semantics of new-style classes.</P>



<A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-SECT-4.2.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">5.4.2.2 A substantial custom metaclass example</H5>

<P class="docText"><A NAME="pythonian-CHP-5-ITERM-4546"></A>Suppose that, programming in Python,
we miss C's <TT>struct</TT> type: an
object that is just a bunch of data attributes with fixed names.
Python lets us easily define an appropriate <TT>Bunch</TT>
class, apart from the fixed names:</P>

<PRE>class Bunch(object):
    def _ _init_ _(self, **fields): self._ _dict_ _ = fields
p = Bunch(x=2.3, y=4.5)
print p                     # prints: &lt;_ _main_ _.Bunch object at 0x00AE8B10&gt;</PRE>

<P class="docText">However, a custom metaclass lets us exploit the fact that the
attribute names are fixed at class creation time. The code shown in
<A class="docLink" HREF="#pythonian-CHP-5-EX-1">Example 5-1</A> defines a metaclass,
<TT>metaMetaBunch</TT>, and a class,
<TT>MetaBunch</TT>, that let us write code like the
following:</P>

<PRE>class Point(MetaBunch):
    """ A point has x and y coordinates, defaulting to 0.0, and a color,
        defaulting to 'gray' -- and nothing more, except what Python and
        the metaclass conspire to add, such as _ _init_ _ and _ _repr_ _
    """
    x = 0.0
    y = 0.0
    color = 'gray'
# example uses of class Point
q = Point(  )
print q                     # prints: Point(  )
p = Point(x=1.2, y=3.4)
print p                     # prints: Point(y=3.399999999, x=1.2)</PRE>

<P class="docText">In this code, the <TT>print</TT> statements print readable
string representations of our <TT>Point</TT> instances.
<TT>Point</TT> instances are also quite memory-lean, and
their performance is basically the same as for instances of the
simple class <TT>Bunch</TT> in the previous example (no
extra overhead due to special methods getting called implicitly).
Note that <A class="docLink" HREF="#pythonian-CHP-5-EX-1">Example 5-1</A> is quite substantial, and
following all its details requires understanding aspects of Python
