<P class="docText">My heartfelt thanks to everybody who helped me out on this book. Many
Python beginners, practitioners, and experts have read drafts of
parts of the book and have given me feedback to help make it clearer
and more precise, accurate, and readable. Out of those, for the
quality and quantity of their feedback, I must single out for special
thanks Andrea Babini, Andrei Raevsky, Anna Ravenscroft, and my fellow
Python Business Forum board members Jacob Hall&eacute;n and Laura
Creighton.</P>

<P class="docText">Some Python experts gave me indispensable help in specific areas:
Aahz on threading, Itamar Shtull-Trauring on Twisted, Mike Orr on
Cheetah, Eric Jones and Paul Dubois on Numeric, and Tim Peters on
threading, testing, performance issues, and optimization.</P>

<P class="docText">I was also blessed with a wonderful group of technical reviewers:
Fred Drake of Python Labs, co-author of <span class="docEmphasis">Python</span>
<span class="docEmphasis">&amp;</span> <span class="docEmphasis">XML</span>
(O'Reilly) and Grand Poobah of
Python's excellent free documentation; Magnus Lie
Hetland, author of <span class="docEmphasis">Practical</span>
<span class="docEmphasis">Python</span> (Apress); Steve Holden, author of
<span class="docEmphasis">Python</span> <span class="docEmphasis">Web</span>
<span class="docEmphasis">Programming</span> (New Riders); and last but not least
Sue Giller, whose observations as a sharp-eyed, experienced,
non-Pythonista programmer were particularly useful in the pursuit of
clarity and precision. The book's editor, Paula
Ferguson, went above and beyond the call of duty in her work to make
this book clearer and more readable.</P>

<P class="docText">My family and friends have been patient and supportive throughout the
time it took me to write this book: particular thanks for that to my
children Flavia and Lucio, my partner Marina, my sister Elisabetta,
and my father Lanfranco.</P>
