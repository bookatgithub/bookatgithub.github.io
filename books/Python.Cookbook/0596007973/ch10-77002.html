<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2596"></a>In this chapter, we consider a
class of programmerthe humble system administratorin
contrast to other chapters' focus on functional
domains. As a programmer, the system administrator faces most of the
same problems that other programmers face and should find the rest of
this book of at least equal interest.</p>

<p class="docText">Python's advantages in the system administration
domain are also quite familiar to other Python programmers, but
Python's competition is different. On Unix
platforms, at any rate, the landscape is dominated by a handful of
lightweight languages such as the Bourne shell and awk that
aren't exactly made obsolete by Python. These little
languages can often support a simpler, clearer, and more concise
solution than Python, particularly for commands that
you're typing interactively at the shell command
prompt. But Python can do things these languages
can't, and it's often more robust
when dealing with issues such as unusually large data inputs. Another
notable competitor, especially on Unix systems, is Perl (which
isn't really a little language at all), with just
about the same overall power as Python, and usable for typing a few
commands interactively at the shell's command
prompt. Python's strength here is readability and
maintainability: when you dust off a script you wrote in a hurry
eight months ago, because you need to make some changes to it, you
don't spend an hour to figure out whatever exactly
you had in mind when you wrote this or that subtle trick. You just
don't use any tricks at all, subtle or gross, so
that your Python scrips work just fine <span class="docEmphasis">and</span> you
don't burn your time, months later, striving to
reverse-engineer them for understanding.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2597"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2598"></a>One item
that stands out in this chapter's solutions is the
<I>wrapper</i>: the alternative, programmed interface
to a software system. On Unix (including, these days, Mac OS X), this
is usually a fairly prosaic matter of diversion and analysis of text
I/O. Life is easy when the programs you're dealing
with are able to just give clean textual output, without requiring
complex interaction (see Eric Raymond, <span class="docEmphasis">The Art of Unix
Programming</span>, <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/">http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/</a>, for an
informative overview of how programs <span class="docEmphasis">should</span> be
architected to make your life easy). However, even when you have to
wrap a program that's necessarily interactive, all
is far from lost. Python has very good support in this area, thanks,
first of all, to the fact that it places C-level pseudo-TTY functions
at your disposal (see the <tt>pty</tt> module of the Python
Standard Library). The pseudo-TTY device is like a bidirectional pipe
with TTY driver support, so it's essential for
things such as password prompts that insist on a TTY. Because it
appears to be a TTY, applications writing to a pseudo-TTY normally
use line buffering, instead of the block buffering that gives
problems with pipes. Pipes are more portable and less trouble to work
with, but they don't work for interfacing to every
application. Excellent third-party extensions exist that wrap
<tt>pty</tt> into higher-level layers for ease of use, most
notably Pexpect, <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/">http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/</a>.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2599"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2600"></a></P>

<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2603"></a>On Windows, the situation often
is not as prosaic as on Unix-like platforms, since the information
you need to do your system administration job may be somewhere in the
registry, may be available via some Windows APIs, and/or may be
available via COM. The standard Python library
<tt>_winreg</tt> module, Mark Hammond's
<tt>PyWin32</tt> package, and Thomas
Heller's <tt>ctypes</tt>, taken together,
give the Windows administrator reasonably easy access to all of these
sources, and you'll see more Windows administration
recipes here than you will ones for Unix. The competition for Python
as a system administration language on Windows is feeble compared to
that on Unix, which is yet another reason for the
platform's prominence here. The
<tt>PyWin32</tt> extensions are available for download at
<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/</a>.
<tt>PyWin32</tt> also comes with
ActiveState's ActivePython distribution of Python
(<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.activestate.com/ActivePython/">http://www.activestate.com/ActivePython/</a>). To
use this rich and extremely useful package most effectively, you also
need Mark Hammond and Andy Robinson, <span class="docEmphasis">Python Programming on
Win32</span> (O'Reilly).

<p class="docText">While it may sometimes be difficult to see what brought all the
recipes together in this chapter, it isn't difficult
to see why system administrators deserve their own chapter: Python
would be nowhere without them! Who else, back when Python was still
an obscure, fledgling language, could bring it into an organization
and almost covertly infiltrate it into the working environment? If it
weren't for the offices of these benevolent and
pragmatic anarchists, Python might well have languished in obscurity
despite its merits.</P>
