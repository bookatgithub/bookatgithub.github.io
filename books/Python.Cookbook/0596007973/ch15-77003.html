<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2945"></a>The recipes in this chapter describe
simple techniques for using Python in distributed systems.
Programming distributed systems is a difficult challenge, and recipes
alone won't even come close to completely solving
it. The recipes help you get programs on different computers talking
to each other, so that you can start writing applications.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2946"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2947"></a>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is an
attractive approach to structuring a distributed system. The details
of network communication are exposed through an interface that looks
like normal procedure calls. When you call a function on a remote
server, the RPC system is responsible for all the details of
communication. It encodes the arguments so they can be passed over
the network to the server, which might use different internal
representations for the data. It invokes the right function on the
remote machine and waits for a response.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2948"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2949"></a>The
recipes in this chapter use three different systems that provide RPC
interfacesCommon Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA),
Twisted's Perspective Broker (PB), and, in most
recipes, XML-RPC. These systems are attractive because they make it
easy to connect programs that can be running on different computers
and might even be written in different languages. CORBA is a rather
"heavyweight" protocol, very rich
in functionality, with specialized and dedicated marshaling and
transport layers (and much more besides). XML-RPC is a lightweight,
simple-to-use protocol, which uses XML to marshal the call and its
associated data, and HTTP for transport. Being simple and
lightweight, XML-RPC is less functionally rich than CORBA. Both CORBA
and XML-RPC are well-established standards, with implementations
available for a wide variety of languages. In particular, XML-RPC is
so simple and widespread that XML-RPC recipes take up half this
chapter, a good, if rough, indication of how often Pythonistas are
using it in preference to other distributed programming
approaches.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2950"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2951"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2952"></a></P>

<p class="docText">PB is also "lightweight", while
offering richer functionality than XML-RPC. However, PB is not a
separate standard but a part of the Twisted framework, so PB
implementations are currently limited to what Twisted itself provides
and are mostly in Python. Perspective Broker is unusual among RPC
systems because it openly exposes at application level the fact that
network transactions are <i>asynchronous</I>, not
<i>synchronous</I> like procedure calls within a
single process. Therefore, in PB, the launching of a call to the
remote procedure does not necessarily imply an immediate wait for the
procedure's results; rather, the
"result"s arrive
"later" through a callback
mechanism (specifically, Twisted's
<tt>deferred</tt> objects). This asynchronous approach,
which is the conceptual core of the Twisted framework, offers
substantial advantages in terms of performance and scalability of the
"result"ing network applications,
but it may take some getting used to. Simon Foster's
approach, shown in recipe, <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-7.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-7">Recipe 15.7</a>, is a simple way to get
started exploring Perspective Broker.</p>

<p class="docText">XML-RPC<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2953"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2954"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2955"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2956"></a> is well supported by the
Python Standard Library, with the <tt>xmlrpclib</tt> module
for writing XML-RPC clients and the
<tt>SimpleXMLRPCServer</tt> module for writing XML-RPC
servers. For Twisted, CORBA, and other RPC standards yet (such as the
emerging SOAPSimple Object Access Protocolsystem), you
need to install third-party extensions before you can get started.
The recipes in this chapter include pointers to the software you
need. Unfortunately, you will not find pointers specifically to SOAP
resources for Python in the recipes: for such pointers, I suggest you
check out <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/">http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/</a>.</P>

<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2960"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2961"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2962"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2963"></a>The Python
Standard Library also provides a set of modules for doing the
lower-level work of network
programming<tt>socket</tt>,
<tt>select</tt>, <tt>asyncore</tt>, and
<tt>asynchat</tt>. The library also includes modules for
marshaling data and sending it across sockets:
<tt>struct</tt>, <tt>pickle</tt>,
<tt>xdrlib</tt>. <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-13.html#pythoncook2-CHP-13">Chapter 13</a>, includes
recipes in which some of these modules are directly used, and <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-7.html#pythoncook2-CHP-7">Chapter 7</a>, contains recipes dealing with serialization
and marshaling. These lower-level modules, in turn, provide the
plumbing for many other higher-level modules that directly support a
variety of standard network protocols. Jeff Bauer offers <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-9.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-9">Recipe 15.9</a>, using the telnetlib module
to send commands to remote machines via the Telnet protocol. Telnet
is not a very secure protocol, and thus, except for use within
well-protected LANs, has been largely supplanted by more secure
protocols such as SSH (Secure Shell). Peter Cogolo and Anna Martelli
Ravenscroft offer similar functionality to Bauer's,
in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-10.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-10">Recipe 15.10</a>, which uses
SSH (via the third-party package <tt>paramiko</tt>) rather
than Telnet.</P>

<p class="docText">Six of the recipes, just about half of the chapter, focus on XML-RPC.
Rael Dornfest and Jeremy Hylton demonstrate how to write an XML-RPC
client program that retrieves data from
O'Reilly's Meerkat service. <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-1.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-1">Recipe 15.1</a> is only three lines
long (including the <tt>import</tt> statement): indeed,
this extreme conciseness is the recipe's main
appeal.</p>

<p class="docText">Brian Quinlan and Jeff Bauer contribute two different recipes for
constructing XML-RPC servers. Quinlan, in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-2.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-2">Recipe 15.2</a>, shows how to use the
<tt>SimpleXMLRPCServer</tt> module from the Python Standard
Library to handle incoming requests. Bauer's is
<a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-3.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-3">Recipe 15.3</a>. Medusa, like
Twisted, is a framework for writing asynchronous network programs. In
both cases, the libraries do most of the work; other than a few lines
of initialization and registration, the server looks like normal
Python code.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2964"></a></P>

<p class="docText">Christop Dietze (with contributions from Brian Quinlan and Jeff
Bauer), in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-4.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-4">Recipe 15.4</a>,
elaborates on the XML-RPC server theme by showing how to add the
ability that enables remote clients to terminate the server cleanly.
Rune Hansen, in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-5.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-5">Recipe 15.5</a>, shows how to add several
minor but useful niceties to your XML-RPC servers.</P>

<p class="docText">Peter Arwanitis, in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-6.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-6">Recipe 15.6</a>, demonstrates how to
implement an XML-RPC server with Twisted and, at the same time, give
your server a GUI, thanks to the wxPython GUI framework.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2965"></a>A strong alternative to XML-based
protocols is CORBA, an object-based RPC mechanism using its own
protocol, IIOP (Internet Inter-Orb Protocol). CORBA is a mature
technology compared to XML-RPC (or, even more, SOAP, which
isn't used in any of these recipesapparently,
Pythonistas aren't doing all that much with SOAP
yet). CORBA was introduced in 1991. The Python language binding was
officially approved more recently, in February 2000, and several ORBs
(Object Request Brokersroughly, CORBA servers) support Python.
Duncan Grisby, a researcher at AT&amp;T Laboratories in Cambridge
(U.K.), describes the basics of getting a CORBA client and server
running in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-8.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-8">Recipe 15.8</a>,
which uses omniORB, a free ORB, and the Python binding he wrote for
it.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2966"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2967"></a></p>

<p class="docText">CORBA has a reputation for complexity, but Grisby's
recipe makes it look straightforward. More steps are involved in the
CORBA client than in the XML-RPC client example, but they are not
difficult. To connect an XML-RPC client to a server, you just need a
URL. To connect a CORBA client to a server, you need a URLa
special <tt>corbaloc</tt> URLand you also need to
know the server's interface. Of course, you need to
know the interface regardless of protocol, but CORBA uses it
explicitly. In general, CORBA offers more features than other
distributed programming frameworksinterfaces, type checking,
passing references to objects, and more. CORBA also supports just
about every Python data type as argument or result.</p>

<p class="docText">Regardless of the protocols or systems you choose, the recipes in
this chapter can help get you started. Inter-program communication is
an important part of building a distributed system, but
it's just one part. Once you have a client and
server working, you'll find you have to deal with
other interesting, challenging problemserror detection,
concurrency, and security, to name a few. The recipes here
won't solve those problems, but they will prevent
you from getting caught up in unimportant details of the
communication protocols. Rob Riggs in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-11.html#pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-11">Recipe 15.11</a> presents a simple way to use
HTTPS (as supported by the Python Standard Library module
<tt>httplib</tt>) to authenticate SSL clients; Simon
Foster's previously mentioned Perspective Broker
recipe provides a way to implement one specific but frequent strategy
for error detection and handling, namely periodically trying to
reconnect to a server after a timeout or explicitly discovered
network error.</p>
