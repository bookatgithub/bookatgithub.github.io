<p class="docText">The best solution is to wrap the specific strings in question into a
suitable subclass of <tt>str</tt>:</p>

<pre>class iStr(str):
    """
    Case insensitive string class.
    Behaves just like str, except that all comparisons and lookups

        ''' try lowercasing 'other', which is typically a string, but
            be prepared to use it as-is if lowering gives problems,
            since strings CAN be correctly compared with non-strings.
        '''

        except (TypeError, AttributeError, ValueError): pass
        return str_meth(self._lowered, other, *args)
    # in Python 2.4, only, add the statement: x.func_name = name
    setattr(iStr, name, x)
# apply the _make_case_insensitive function to specified methods

    _make_case_insensitive('_ _%s_ _' % name)

    _make_case_insensitive(name)
# note that we don't modify methods 'replace', 'split', 'strip', ...
# of course, you can add modifications to them, too, if you prefer that.

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1585"></a>Some implementation choices in class
<I>iStr</i> are worthy of notice. First, we choose to
generate the lowercase version once and for all, in method <tt>_
_init_ _</tt>, since we envision that in typical uses of
<I>iStr</I> instances, this version will be required
repeatedly. We hold that version in an attribute that is private, but
not overly so (i.e., has a name that begins with one underscore, not
two), because if <i>iStr</i> gets subclassed (e.g., to make
a more extensive version that also offers case-insensitive splitting,
replacing, etc., as the comment in the
"Solution" suggests),
<i>iStr</i>'s subclasses are quite likely
to want to access this crucial "implementation
detail" of superclass <I>iStr</i>!</p>

<p class="docText">We do not offer "case-insensitive"
versions of such methods as <tt>replace</tt>, because
it's anything but clear what kind of input-output
relation we might want to establish in the general case.
Application-specific subclasses may therefore be the way to provide
this functionality in ways appropriate to a given application. For
example, since the <tt>replace</tt> method is not wrapped,
calling <tt>replace</tt> on an instance of
<I>iStr</i> returns an instance of <tt>str</tt>,
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> of <I>iStr</i>. If that is a
problem in your application, you may want to wrap all
<I>iStr</I> methods that return strings, simply to ensure
that the results are made into instances of <i>iStr</i>.
For that purpose, you need another, separate helper function, similar
but not identical to the <i>_make_case_insensitive</i> one
shown in the
"Solution":<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1586"></a></p>

<pre>def _make_return_iStr(name):
    str_meth = getattr(str, name)
    def x(*args):
        return iStr(str_meth(*args))
    setattr(iStr, name, x)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">and you need to call this helper function
<i>_make_return_iStr</i> on all the names of relevant
string methods returning strings such as:</p>

<pre>for name in 'center ljust rjust strip lstrip rstrip'.split( ):
    _make_return_iStr(name)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Strings have about 20 methods (including special methods such as
<tt>_ _add_ _</tt> and <tt>_ _mul_ _</tt>) that
you should consider wrapping in this way. You can also wrap in this
way some additional methods, such as <tt>split</tt> and
<tt>join</tt>, which may require special handling, and
others, such as <tt>encode</tt> and
<tt>decode</tt>, that you cannot deal with unless you also
define a case-insensitive <tt>unicode</tt> subtype. In
practice, one can hope that not every single one of these methods
will prove problematic in a typical application. However, as you can
see, the very functional richness of Python strings makes it a bit of
work to customize string subtypes fully, in a general way without
depending on the needs of a specific application.</p>

<p class="docText">The implementation of <i>iStr</i> is careful to avoid the
boilerplate code (meaning repetitious and therefore bug-prone code)
that we'd need if we just overrode each needed
method of <tt>str</tt> in the normal way, with
<tt>def</tt> statements in the class body. A custom
metaclass or other such advanced technique would offer no special
advantage in this case, so the boilerplate avoidance is simply
obtained with one helper function that generates and installs wrapper
closures, and two loops using that function, one for normal methods
and one for special ones. The loops need to be placed
<span class="docEmphasis">after</span> the <tt>class</tt> statement, as
we do in this recipe's Solution, because they need
to modify the class object <I>iStr</I>, and the class
object doesn't exist yet (and thus cannot be
modified) until the <tt>class</tt> statement has completed.</p>

<p class="docText">In Python 2.4, you can reassign the <tt>func_name</tt>
attribute of a function object, and in this case, you should do so to
get clearer and more readable results when introspection (e.g., the
<tt>help</tt> function in an interactive interpreter
session) is applied to an <tt>iStr</tt> instance. However,
Python 2.3 considers attribute <tt>func_name</tt> of
function objects to be read-only; therefore, in this
recipe's Solution, we have indicated this
possibility only in a comment, to avoid losing Python 2.3
compatibility over such a minor issue.</p>

<p class="docText">Case-insensitive (but case-preserving) strings have many uses, from
more tolerant parsing of user input, to filename matching on
filesystems that share this characteristic, such as all of Windows
filesystems and the Macintosh default filesystem. You might easily
find yourself creating a variety of
"case-insensitive" container types,
such as dictionaries, lists, sets, and so onmeaning containers
that go out of their way to treat string-valued keys or items as if
they were case-insensitive. Clearly a better architecture is to
factor out the functionality of
"case-insensitive" comparisons and
lookups once and for all; with this recipe in your toolbox, you can
just add the required wrapping of strings into <I>iStr</i>
instances wherever you may need it, including those times when
you're making case-insensitive container types.</p>

<p class="docText">For example, a list whose items are basically strings, but are to be
treated case-insensitively (for sorting purposes and in such methods
as <tt>count</tt> and <tt>index</tt>), is
reasonably easy to build on top of <i>iStr</i>:</p>

<pre>class iList(list):
    def _ _init_ _(self, *args):
        list._ _init_ _(self, *args)
        # rely on _ _setitem_ _ to wrap each item into iStr...
        self[:] = self
    wrap_each_item = iStr
    def _ _setitem_ _(self, i, v):
        if isinstance(i, slice): v = map(self.wrap_each_item, v)
        else: v = self.wrap_each_item(v)
        list._ _setitem_ _(self, i, v)
    def append(self, item):
        list.append(self, self.wrap_each_item(item))
    def extend(self, seq):
        list.extend(self, map(self.wrap_each_item, seq))</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Essentially, all we're doing is ensuring that every
item that gets into an instance of <I>iList</i> gets
wrapped by a call to <I>iStr</i>, and everything else takes
care of itself.</P>

<p class="docText">Incidentally, this example class <i>iList</I> is accurately
coded so that you can easily make customized subclasses of
<I>iList</i> to accommodate application-specific subclasses
of <I>iStr</I>: all such a customized subclass of
<i>iList</i> needs to do is override the single class-level
member named <i>wrap_each_item</i>.</P>
