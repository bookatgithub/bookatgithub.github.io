<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-8.1"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You need to check for the occurrence of any of a set of characters in
a string.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-8.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">The simplest approach is clear, fast, and general (it works for any
sequence, not just strings, and for any container on which you can
test for membership, not just sets):</p>

<pre>def containsAny(seq, aset):
    """ Check whether sequence seq contains ANY of the items in aset. """
    for c in seq:
        if c in aset: return True
    return False</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">You can gain a little speed by moving to a higher-level, more
sophisticated approach, based on the <tt>itertools</tt>
standard library module, essentially expressing the same approach in
a different way:<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1482"></a></p>

<pre>import itertools
def containsAny(seq, aset):
    for item in itertools.ifilter(aset._ _contains_ _, seq):
        return True
    return False</pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-8.3"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">Most problems related to sets are best handled by using the
<tt>set</tt> built-in type introduced in Python 2.4 (if
you're using Python 2.3, you can use the equivalent
<tt>sets.Set</tt> type from the Python Standard Library).
However, there are exceptions. Here, for example, a pure set-based
approach would be something like:</P>

<pre>def containsAny(seq, aset):
    return bool(set(aset).intersection(seq))</pre><BR>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1483"></a>However,
with this approach, every item in <i>seq</i> inevitably has
to be examined. The functions in this recipe's
Solution, on the other hand,
"short-circuit": they return as
soon as they know the answer. They must still check every item in
<i>seq</i> when the answer is
<tt>False</tt>we could never affirm that no item in
<I>seq</i> is a member of <i>aset</I> without
examining all the items, of course. But when the answer is
<tt>true</tt>, we often learn about that very soon, namely
as soon as we examine one item that <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> a member
of <I>aset</i>. Whether this matters at all is very
data-dependent, of course. It will make no practical difference when
<I>seq</I> is short, or when the answer is typically
<tt>False</tt>, but it may be extremely important for a
very long <i>seq</i> (when the answer can typically be soon
determined to be <tt>true</tt>).</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1484"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1485"></a>The first
version of <i>containsAny</i> presented in the recipe has
the advantage of simplicity and clarity: it expresses the fundamental
idea with total transparency. The second version may appear to be
"clever", and that is not a
complimentary adjective in the Python world, where simplicity and
clarity are core values. However, the second version is well worth
considering, because it shows a higher-level approach, based on the
<tt>itertools</tt> module of the standard library.
Higher-level approaches are most often preferable to lower-level ones
(although the issue is moot in this particular case).
<tt>itertools.ifilter</tt> takes a predicate and an
iterable, and yields the items in that iterable that satisfy the
"predicate". Here, as the
"predicate", we use
<i>anyset._ _contains_ _</i>, the bound method that is
internally called when we code <tt>in anyset</tt> for
membership testing. So, if <tt>ifilter</tt> yields anything
at all, it yields an item of <i>seq</i> that is also a
member of <i>anyset</i>, so we can <tt>return
True</tt> as soon as this happens. If we get to the statement
following the <tt>for</tt>, it must mean the
<tt>return True</tt> never executed, because no items of
<i>seq</I> are members of <I>anyset</i>, so we
can <tt>return False</tt>.</p>

<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-SIDEBAR-2"></a><P><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td>
<h2 class="docSidebarTitle">What Is "a Predicate?"</h2>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1486"></a>A term you can
see often in discussions about programming is
<i>predicate</i>: it just means a function (or other
callable object) that returns <tt>TRue</tt> or
<tt>False</tt> as its result. A predicate is said to be
<i>satisfied</I> when it returns
<tt>true</tt>.</P>
</td></TR></table></P><br>

<p class="docText">If your application needs some function such as
<I>containsAny</I> to check whether a string (or other
sequence) contains any members of a set, you may also need such
variants as:</p>

<pre>def containsOnly(seq, aset):
    """ Check whether sequence seq contains ONLY items in aset. """
    for c in seq:
        if c not in aset: return False
    return True</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><i>containsOnly</i><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1487"></a> is the same function as
<I>containsAny</i>, but with the logic turned upside-down.
Other apparently similar tasks don't lend themselves
to short-circuiting (they intrinsically need to examine all items)
and so are best tackled by using the built-in type
<tt>set</tt> (in Python 2.4; in 2.3, you can use
<tt>sets.Set</tt> in the same way):</p>

<pre>def containsAll(seq, aset):
    """ Check whether sequence seq contains ALL the items in aset. """
    return not set(aset).difference(seq)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1488"></a>If
you're not accustomed to using the
<tt>set</tt> (or <tt>sets.Set</tt>) method
<tt>difference</tt>, be aware of its semantics: for any
<tt>set</tt> <tt><i>a</I></tt>,
<tt>a.difference(b)</tt> (just like
<tt>a-set(b)</tt>) returns the set of all elements of
<tt><i>a</I></tt> that are not in
<tt><I>b</i></tt>. For example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; L1 = [1, 2, 3, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; L2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(L1).difference(L2)
<b>set([  ])</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(L2).difference(L1)
<b>set([4])</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">which hopefully helps explain why:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; containsAll(L1, L2)
<b>False</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; containsAll(L2, L1)
<b>True</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">(In other words, don't confuse
<tt>difference</tt> with another method of
<tt>set</tt>, <tt>symmetric_difference</tt>,
which returns the set of all items that are in
<span class="docEmphasis">either</span> argument and not in the other.)</p>

<p class="docText">When you're dealing specifically with (plain,
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> Unicode) strings for both
<i>seq</i> and <i>aset</I>, you may not need the
full generality of the functions presented in this recipe, and may
want to try the more specialized approach explained in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-10.html#pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-10">Recipe 1.10</a> based on
strings' method <tt>TRanslate</tt> and the
<tt>string.maketrans</tt> function from the Python Standard
Library. For example:<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1489"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1490"></a></p>

<pre>import string
notrans = string.maketrans('', '')           # identity "translation"
def containsAny(astr, strset):
    return len(strset) != len(strset.translate(notrans, astr))
def containsAll(astr, strset):
    return not strset.translate(notrans, astr)</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1491"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-1-ITERM-1492"></a>This
somewhat tricky approach relies on <tt>strset.translate(notrans,
astr)</tt> being the subsequence of <I>strset</i> that
is made of characters not in <tt>astr</tt>. When that
subsequence has the same length as <tt>strset</tt>, no
characters have been removed by <i>strset.translate</i>,
therefore no characters of <i>strset</i> are in
<tt>astr</tt>. Conversely, when the subsequence is empty,
all characters have been removed, so all characters of
<i>strset</I> are in <tt>astr</tt>. The
<tt>translate</tt> method keeps coming up naturally when
one wants to treat strings as sets of characters, because
it's speedy as well as handy and flexible; see
<a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-10.html#pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-10">Recipe 1.10</a> for more
details.</P>

<p class="docText">These two sets of approaches to the recipe's tasks
have very different levels of generality. The earlier approaches are
very general: not at all limited to string processing, they make
rather minimal demands on the objects you apply them to. The approach
based on the <tt>translate</tt> method, on the other hand,
works only when both <tt>astr</tt> and
<tt>strset</tt> are strings, or <span class="docEmphasis">very</span>
closely mimic plain strings' functionality. Not even
Unicode strings suffice, because the <tt>TRanslate</tt>
method of Unicode strings has a signature that is different from that
of plain stringsa single argument (a <tt>dict</tt>
mapping code numbers to Unicode strings or <tt>None</tt>)
instead of two (both strings).</p>
