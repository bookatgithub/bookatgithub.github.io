<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2615"></a>You need to monitor how
often client requests are refused by your Apache web server because
the client's cache of the page is already up to
date.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-SECT-5.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">When a browser queries a server for a page that the browser has in
its cache, the browser lets the server know about the cached data,
and the server returns a special error code (rather than serving the
page again) if the client's cache is up to date.
Here's how to find the statistics for such
occurrences in your server's logs:</p>

<pre>def clientCachePercentage(logfile_pathname):
    contents = open(logfile_pathname, "r")
    totalRequests = 0
    cachedRequests = 0
    for line in contents:
        totalRequests += 1
        <span class="docEmphBold">if line.split(" ")[8] == "304</span>":
            # if server returned "not modified"
            cachedRequests += 1
    return int(0.5+float(100*cachedRequests)/totalRequests)</pre><BR>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">The percentage of requests to your Apache server that are met by the
client's own cache is an important factor in the
perceived performance of your server. The code in this recipe helps
you get this information from the server's log.
Typical use would be:</P>

<pre>log_path = "/usr/local/nusphere/apache/logs/access_log"
print "Percentage of requests that were client-cached: " + str(
       clientCachePercentage(log_path)) + '%'</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The recipe reads the log file one line at a time by looping over the
filethe normal way to read a file nowadays. Trying to read the
whole log file in memory, by calling the <tt>readlines</tt>
method on the file object, would be an unsuitable approach for very
large files, which server log files can certainly be. That approach
might not work at all, or might work but damage performance
considerably by swamping your machine's virtual
memory. Even when it works, <tt>readlines</tt> offers no
advantage over the approach used in this recipe.</P>

<p class="docText">The body of the <tt>for</tt> loop calls the
<I>split</i> method on each line string, with a string of a
single space as the argument, to split the line into a tuple of its
space-separated fields. Then it uses indexing
(<tt>[8]</tt>) to get the ninth such field. Apache puts the
error code into the ninth field of each line in the log. Code
"<tt>304</tt>" means "not
modified" (i.e., the client's cache
was already correctly updated). We count those cases in the
<i>cachedRequests</i> variable and all lines in the log in
the <i>totalRequests</I> variable, so that, in the end, we
can return the percentage of cache hits. The expression we use in the
<tt>return</tt> statement computes the percentage as a
<tt>float</tt> number, then rounds it correctly to the
closest <tt>int</tt>, because an integer result is most
useful in practice.</p>
