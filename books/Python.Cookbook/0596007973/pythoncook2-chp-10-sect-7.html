<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2620"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2621"></a>You want to make
frequent backup copies of all files you have modified within a
directory tree, so that further changes won't
accidentally obliterate some of your editing.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-SECT-7.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">Version-control systems, such as RCS, CVS, and SVN, are very powerful
and useful, but sometimes a simple script that you can easily edit
and customize can be even handier. The following script checks for
new files to back up in a tree that you specify. Run the script
periodically to keep your backup copies up to date.</p>

<pre>import sys, os, shutil, filecmp
MAXVERSIONS=100
def backup(tree_top, bakdir_name='bakdir'):
    for dir, subdirs, files in os.walk(tree_top):
        # ensure each directory has a subdir called bakdir
        backup_dir = os.path.join(dir, bakdir_name)
        if not os.path.exists(newdir):
            os.makedirs(newdir)
        # stop any recursing into the backup directories
        subdirs[:] = [d for d in subdirs if d != bakdir_name]
        for file in files:
            filepath = os.path.join(dir, file)
            destpath = os.path.join(backup_dir, file)
            # check existence of previous versions
            for index in xrange(MAXVERSIONS):
                backup = '%s.%2.2d' % (destpath, index)
                if not os.path.exists(backup): break
            if index &gt; 0:
                # no need to backup if file and last version are identical
                old_backup = '%s.%2.2d' % (destpath, index-1)
                try:
                    if os.path.isfile(old_backup
                       ) and filecmp.cmp(abspath, old_backup, shallow=False):
                        continue
                    except OSError:
                        pass
            try:
                shutil.copy(filepath, backup)
            except OSError:
                pass
if _ _name_ _ == '_ _main_ _':
    # run backup on the specified directory (default: the current directory)
    try: tree_top = sys.argv[1]
    except IndexError: tree_top = '.'
    backup(tree_top)</pre><BR>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">Although version-control systems are more powerful, this script can
be useful in development work. I often customize it, for example, to
keep backups only of files with certain extensions (or, when
that's handier, of all files
<span class="docEmphasis">except</span> those with certain extensions); it
suffices to add an appropriate test at the very start of the
<tt>for file in files</tt> loop, such as:</P>

<pre>        name, ext = os.path.splitext(file)
        if ext not in ('.py', '.txt', '.doc'): continue</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2622"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2623"></a>This snippet
first uses function <tt>splitext</tt> from the standard
library module <tt>os.path</tt> to extract the file
extension (starting with a period) into local variable
<tt><I>ext</I></tt>, then conditionally executes statement
<tt>continue</tt>, which passes to the next leg of the
loop, unless the extension is one of a few that happen to be the ones
of interest in the current subtree.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-10-ITERM-2624"></a>Other potentially useful variants
include backing files up to some <span class="docEmphasis">other</span> subtree
(potentially on a removable drive, which has some clear advantages
for backup purposes) rather than the current one, compressing the
files that are being backed up (look at standard library module
<tt>gzip</tt> for this purpose), and more refined ones yet.
However, rather than complicating function <i>backup</i> by
offering all of these variants as options, I prefer to copy the
entire script to the root of each of the various subtrees of
interest, and customize it with a little simple editing. While this
strategy would be a very bad one for any kind of complicated, highly
reusable production-level code, it is reasonable for a simple,
straightforward system administration utility such as the one in this
recipe.</p>

<p class="docText">Worthy of note in this recipe's implementation is
the use of function <tt>os.walk</tt>, a generator from the
standard Python library's module
<tt>os</tt>, which makes it very simple to iterate over all
or most of a filesystem subtree, with no need for such subtleties as
recursion or callbacks, just a straightforward <tt>for</tt>
statement. To avoid backing up the backups, this recipe uses one
advanced feature of <tt>os.walk</tt>: the second one of the
three values that <tt>os.walk</tt> yields at each step
through the loop is a list of subdirectories of the current
directory. We can modify this list <span class="docEmphasis">in place</span>,
removing some of the subdirectory names it contains. When we perform
such an in-place modification, <tt>os.walk</tt> does not
recurse through the subdirectories whose names we removed. The
following steps deal only with the subdirectories whose names are
left in. This subtle but useful feature of <tt>os.walk</tt>
is one good example of how a generator can receive information from
the code that's iterating on it, to affect details
of the iteration being performed.</P>
