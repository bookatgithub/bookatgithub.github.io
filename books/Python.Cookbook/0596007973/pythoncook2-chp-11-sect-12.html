<p class="docText">Here is an example of use of this <I>LabeledEntry</i>
widget, presented, as usual, with a guard of <tt>if _ _name_ _
== '_ _main_ _</tt>' so we can make it part of the module
containing the class and have it run when the module is executed as a
"main script":</P>

<p class="docText">The usual approach to defining new compound Tkinter widgets is to
inherit from <tt>Frame</tt> and pack your component widgets
inside. While simple and habitual, that approach has a few problems.
In particular, you need to invent, design, document, and implement
additional methods or options to access the component
widgets' attributes from outside of the compound
widget class. Using another alternative (which I've
often seen done, but it's still a practice that is
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> advisable at all!), you can violate
encapsulation and Demeter's Law by having other code
access the component widgets directly. If you do violate
encapsulation, you'll pay for it in the not-so-long
run, when you find a need to tweak your compound widget and discover
that you can't do it without breaking lots of code
that depends on the compound widget's internal
structure. Those consequences are bad enough when you own all of the
code in question, but it's worse if you have
"published" your widget and
<span class="docEmphasis">other</span> people's code depends on
it.</p>

<p class="docText">This recipe shows it doesn't have to be that bad, by
elaborating upon an idea I first saw used in the
<tt>ScrolledText</tt> widget, which deserves to be more
widely exposed. Instead of inheriting from <tt>Frame</tt>,
you inherit from the "main" widget
of your new compound widget. Then, you create a
<tt>Frame</tt> widget to be used as a body, pretty much
like in the more usual approach. Then, and here comes the interesting
novelty, you create <tt>dict</tt>s for each component
widget you contain and <i>move</i> to those
dictionaries the respective options that pertain to component
widgets.</p>

<p class="docText">The novelty continues after you've packed the
"main" widget: at that point, you
can reset said widget's geometry methods to the base
<tt>Frame</tt> attributes (meaning, in this case, methods),
so that accessing the object methods will in fact access the inner
base <tt>Frame</tt> geometry methods. This transparent,
seamless delegation by juggling bound methods is uniquely Pythonic
and is part of what makes this recipe so novel and interesting!</P>

<p class="docText">The main advantage of this recipe's approach is that
you can create your widget with options to all slave widgets inside
it in a single line, just like any other widget, instead of doing any
further <tt>w.configure</tt> or
<tt>w['option']</tt> calls or accesses to set all details
exactly the way you want them. To be honest, there
<span class="docEmphasis">is</span> a potential disadvantage, too: in this
recipe's approach, it's hard to
handle options with the same name on different component widgets.
However, sometimes you can handle them by
<span class="docEmphasis">renaming</span> options: if two separate widgets need a
'<tt>foo</tt>' option that's also of
interest to the "main" widget, for
example, use, '<tt>upper_foo</tt>' and
'<tt>lower_foo</tt>' variants and rename them appropriately
(with yet another auxiliary dictionary) at the same time
you're dispatching them to the appropriate
dictionary of component-widget options. You can't
sensibly keep doing that "forever",
as the number of component widgets competing for the same option
grows without bounds: if that happens, revert to the good old
tried-and-true approach. But for nine out of ten compound widgets you
find yourself programming, you'll find this
recipe's approach to be an interesting alternative
to the usual, traditional approach to compound-widget programming.</p>
