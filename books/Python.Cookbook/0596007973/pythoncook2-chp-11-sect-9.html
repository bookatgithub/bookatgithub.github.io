handled by other threads. Here's the code for the
standard Tkinter GUI toolkit that comes with Python:</p>

                # Check contents of message and do whatever is needed. As a
                # simple example, let's print it (in real life, you would
                # suitably update the GUI's display in a richer fashion).
                print msg
            except Queue.Empty:
                # just on general principles, although we don't expect this

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">This recipe demonstrates the easiest way of handling access to
sockets, serial ports, and other asynchronous I/O ports while running
a Tkinter-based GUI. The recipe's principles
generalize to other GUI toolkits, since most toolkits make it
preferable to access the GUI itself from a single thread, and all
offer a toolkit-dependent way to set up periodic polling as this
recipe does.</P>

<p class="docText">Tkinter, like most other GUIs, is best used with all graphic commands
in a single thread. On the other hand, it's far more
efficient to make I/O channels block, then wait for something to
happen, rather than using nonblocking I/O and having to poll at
regular intervals. The latter approach may not even be available in
some cases, since not all data sources support nonblocking I/O.
Therefore, for generality as well as for efficiency, we should handle
I/O with a separate thread, or more than one. The I/O threads can
communicate in a safe way with the
"main", GUI-handling thread through
one or more <tt>Queue</tt>s. In this recipe, the GUI thread
still has to do some polling (on the <tt>Queue</tt>s), to
check whether something in the <tt>Queue</tt> needs to be
processed. Other architectures are possible, but they are much more
complex than the one in this recipe. My advice is to start with this
recipe, which will handle your needs over 90% of the time, and
explore the much more complex alternatives only if it turns out that
this approach cannot meet your performance requirements.</p>

<p class="docText">This recipe lets a worker thread block in a <tt>select</tt>
(simulated by random sleeps in the recipe's example
worker thread). Whenever something arrives, it is received and
inserted in a <tt>Queue</tt> instance. The main (GUI)
thread polls the <tt>Queue</tt> five times per second and
processes all messages that have arrived since it last checked.
(Polling 5 times per second is frequent enough that the end user will
not notice any significant delay but infrequent enough that the
computational load on the computer will be negligible.) You may want
to fine-tune this feature, depending on your needs.</P>

<p class="docText">This recipe solves a common problem that is frequently asked about on
Python mailing lists and newsgroups. Other solutions, involving
synchronization between threads, help you solve such problems without
polling (the <tt>self.master.after</tt> call in the
recipe). Unfortunately, such solutions are generally complicated and
messy, since you tend to raise and wait for semaphores throughout
your code. In any case, a GUI already has several polling mechanisms
built into it (the "main" event
loop), so adding one more won't make much
difference, especially since it seldom runs. The code has been tested
in depth only under Linux, but it should work on any platform with
working threads, including Windows.</P>

<p class="docText">Here is a PyQt equivalent, with very minor variations:</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-11-ITERM-2719"></a>As you can see, this PyQt variation has
a structure that's uncannily similar to the Tkinter
version, with just a few variations (and a few enhancements, such as
using <tt>QApplication.quit</tt> instead of the more brutal
<tt>sys.exit</tt>, and displaying the
thread's result in the GUI itself rather than on the
console).</p>
