<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-13-ITERM-2867"></a>The key
idea in this recipe is to have every computer periodically send a
heartbeat UDP packet to a computer acting as the server for this
heartbeat-monitoring service. The server keeps track of how much time
has passed since each computer last sent a heartbeat and reports on
computers that have been silent for too long.</p>

<p class="docText">Here is the "client" program,
<I>HeartbeatClient.py</i>, which must run on every
computer we need to monitor:</P>

<pre>""" Heartbeat client, sends out a UDP packet periodically """
import socket, time

<p class="docText">The server program, which receives and keeps track of these
"heartbeats", must run on the
machine whose address is given as <i>SERVER_IP</I> in the

support concurrency, since many heartbeats from different computers
might arrive simultaneously. A server program has essentially two
ways to support concurrency: multithreading, or asynchronous

<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">When a number of computers are connected by a TCP/IP network, we are
often interested in monitoring their working state. The client and
server programs presented in this recipe help you detect when a
computer stops working, while having minimal impact on network
traffic and requiring very little setup. Note that this recipe does
not monitor the working state of single, specific services running on
a machine, just that of the TCP/IP stack and the underlying operating
system and hardware components.</P>

<p class="docText">This <i>PyHeartBeat</I> approach is made up of two files: a
client program, <I>HeartbeatClient.py</i>, sends UDP
packets to the server, while a server program, either
<i>ThreadedBeatServer.py</i> (using only modules from
the Python Standard Library to implement a multithreaded approach) or
<i>AsyncBeatServer.py</i> (implementing an asynchronous
approach based on the powerful Twisted framework), runs on a central
computer to listen for such packets and detect inactive clients.
Client programs, running on any number of computers, periodically
send UDP packets to the server program that runs on the central
computer. The server program, in either version, dynamically builds a
dictionary that stores the IP addresses of the
"client" computers and the
timestamp of the last packet received from each one. At the same
time, the server program periodically checks the dictionary, checking
whether any of the timestamps are older than a defined timeout, to
identify clients that have been silent too long.</p>

<p class="docText">In this kind of application, there is no need to use reliable TCP
connections since the loss of a packet now and then does not produce
false alarms, as long as the server-checking timeout is kept suitably
larger than the "client"-sending
period. Since we may have hundreds of computers to monitor, it is
best to keep the bandwidth used and the load on the server at a
minimum: we do this by periodically sending a small UDP packet,
instead of setting up a relatively expensive TCP connection per
client.</p>

<p class="docText">The packets are sent from each client every 5 seconds, while the
server checks the dictionary every 20 seconds, and the
server's timeout defaults to 15 seconds. These
parameters, along with the server IP number and port used, can be
adapted to one's needs.</p>

<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-13-SECT-11.3.1"></a>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Threaded server</h5>

<p class="docText">In the threaded server, a small number of worker threads listen to
the UDP packets coming from the
"client"s, while the main thread
periodically checks the recorded heartbeats. The shared data
structure, a dictionary, must be locked and released at each access,
both while writing and reading, to avoid data corruption on
concurrent access. Such data corruption would typically manifest
itself as intermittent, time-dependent bugs that are difficult to
reproduce, investigate, and correct.</p>

<p class="docText">A very sound alternative to such meticulous use of locking around
access to a resource is to dedicate a specialized thread to be the
only one interacting with the resource (in this case, the
dictionary), while all other threads send work requests to the
specialized thread with a <tt>Queue.Queue</tt> instance. A
<tt>Queue</tt>-based approach is more scalable when
per-resource locking gets too complicated to manage easily:
<tt>Queue</tt> is less bug-prone and, in particular, avoids
worries about deadlocks. See <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-9-SECT-3.html#pythoncook2-CHP-9-SECT-3">Recipe 9.3</a>, <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-9-SECT-5.html#pythoncook2-CHP-9-SECT-5">Recipe 9.5</a>, <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-9-SECT-4.html#pythoncook2-CHP-9-SECT-4">Recipe 9.4</a>, and <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-11-SECT-9.html#pythoncook2-CHP-11-SECT-9">Recipe 11.9</a> for more information about
<tt>Queue</tt> and examples of using
<tt>Queue</tt> to structure the architecture of a
multithreaded program.</p>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-13-SECT-11.3.2"></a>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Asynchronous server</H5>

<p class="docText">The Twisted server employs an asynchronous, event-driven model based
on the Twisted framework (<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/</a>). The framework
is built around a central "reactor"
that dispatches events from a queue in a single thread, and monitors
network and host resources. The user program is composed of short
code fragments invoked by the reactor when dispatching the matching
events. Such a working model guarantees that only one user code
fragment is executing at any given time, eliminating at the root all
problems of concurrent access to shared data structures. Asynchronous
servers can provide excellent performance and scalability under very
heavy loads, by avoiding the threading and locking overheads of
multithreader servers.</P>

<p class="docText">The asynchronous server program presented in this recipe is composed
of one application and two services, the UDPServer and the
DetectorService, respectively. It is invoked at any command shell by
means of the <i>twistd</i> command, with the following
options:</P>

<pre>$ twistd -ony AsyncBeatServer.py</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The <i>twistd</i> command controls the reactor, and many
other delicate facets of a server's operation,
leaving the script it loads the sole responsibility of defining a
global variable named <tt>application</tt>, implementing
the needed services, and connecting the service objects to the
application object.</p>

<p class="docText">Normally, <i>twistd</i> runs as a daemon and logs to a
file (or to other logging facilities, depending on configuration
options), but in this case, with the <I>-ony</i> flags,
we're specifically asking <I>twistd</i>
to run in the foreground and with logging to standard output, so we
can better see what's going on. Note that the most
popular file extension for scripts to be loaded by
<I>twistd</i> is <I>.tac</I>, although in
this recipe I have used the more generally familiar extension
<i>.py</I>. The choice of file extension is just a
convention, in this case: <I>twistd</i> can work with
Python source files with any file extension, since you pass the full
filename, extension included, as an explicit command-line argument
anyway.</p>
