<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">I wanted to use a Dynamic DNS Service called <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="yi.org">yi.org</a>, but I did not like the option of
installing the suggested small client application to update my IP
address on my OpenBSD box. So I resorted to writing the script shown
in this recipe. I put it into my <I>crontab</i> to keep
my domain always up-to-date with my dynamic IP address at home.</P>

<p class="docText">This little script is now at version 0.4, and its development history
is quite instructive. I thought that even the first version. 0.1,
which I got working in a few minutes, effectively demonstrated the
power of the Twisted framework in developing network applications, so
I posted that version on the ActiveState cookbook site. Lo and
beholdMark first, then Andrew, showered me with helpful
suggestions, and I repeatedly updated the script in response to their
advice. So it now demonstrates even better, not just the power of
Twisted, but more generally the power of collaborative development in
an open-source or free-software community.</P>

<p class="docText">To give just one example: originally, I had overridden
<tt>buildProtocol</tt> and passed the factory object to the
protocol object explicitly. The factory object, in the Twisted
framework architecture, is where shared state is kept (in this case,
the username, password, and domain), so I had to ensure the protocol
knew about the factoryI thought. It turns out that, exactly
because just about every protocol needs to know about its factory
object, Twisted takes care of it in its own default implementation of
<tt>buildProtocol</tt>, making the factory object available
as the <tt>factory</tt> attribute of every protocol object.
So, my code, which duplicated Twisted's built-in
functionality in this regard, was simply ripped out, and the
recipe's code is simpler and better as a result.</p>

<p class="docText">Too often, software is presented as a finished and polished artifact,
as if it sprang pristine and perfect like Athena from
Zeus' forehead. This gives entirely the wrong
impression to budding software developers, making them feel
inadequate because <span class="docEmphasis">their</span> code
isn't born perfect and fully developed. So, as a
counterweight, I thought it important to present one little story
about how software actually grows and develops!</p>

<p class="docText">One last detail: it's tempting to place methods
<i>updateIP</i> and <I>removeIP</i> in the
<i>DIPProtocol</I> class, to ease the writing of subclasses
such as <i>DIPUpdater</I>. However, in my view, that would
be an over-generalization, overkill for such a simple, lightweight
recipe as Python and Twisted make this one. In practice we
won't need all that many dynamic IP protocol
subclasses, and if it turns out that we're wrong and
we do, in fact, need them, hey, refactoring is clearly
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> a hard task with such a fluid, dynamic
language and powerful frameworks to draw on. So, respect the prime
directive: "do the simplest thing that can possibly
work."</p>

<p class="docText">In a sense, the code in this recipe could be said to violate the
prime directive, because it uses an elegant object-oriented
architecture with an abstract base class, a concrete subclass to
specialize it, and, in the factory class, accessor methods rather
than simple attribute access for the login data (i.e., user,
password, domain). All of these niceties are lifesavers in big
programs, but they admittedly <span class="docEmphasis">could</span> be foregone
for a program of only 120 lines (which would shrink a little further
if it didn't use all these niceties). However,
adopting a uniform style of program architecture, even for small
programs, eases the refactoring task in those not-so-rare cases where
a small program grows into a big one. So, I have deliberately
developed the habit of always coding in such an
"elegant OO way", and once the
habit is acquired, I find that it enhances, rather than reduces, my
productivity.</P>
