<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">This issue has come up a few times on the newsgroup <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="comp.lang.python">comp.lang.python</a>, so I decided to post
a cookbook entry to show how easy it is to deal
with this kind of task. Specifically, this recipe shows how to read
in an email message, strip out any dangerous or suspicious
attachments, and replace them with a harmless text message informing
the user of the alterations that we're performed.</P>

<p class="docText">This kind of task is particularly important when end users are using
something like Microsoft Outlook, which is targeted by harmful virus
and worm messages (collectively known as
<i>malware</I>) on a daily basis.</P>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-13-ITERM-2846"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-13-ITERM-2847"></a>The email parser in
Python 2.4 has been completely rewritten to be robust first, correct
second. Prior to that version, the parser was written for correctness
first. But focusing on correctness was a problem because many
virus/worm messages and other malware routinely send email messages
that are broken and nonconformantmalformed to the point that
the old email parser chokes and dies. The new parser is designed to
never actually break when reading a message. Instead, it tries its
best to fix whatever it can fix in the message. (If you have a
message that causes the parser to crash, please let us, the core
Python developers, know. It's a bug, and
we'll fix it. Please include a copy of the message
that makes the parser crash, or else it's very
unlikely that we can reproduce your problem!)</p>

<p class="docText">The recipe's code itself is fairly well commented
and should be easy enough to follow. A mail message consists of one
or more parts; each of these parts can contain nested parts. We call
the <i>sanitise</i> function on the top-level
<tt>Message</tt> object, and it calls itself recursively on
the subobjects if and as needed.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-13-ITERM-2848"></a>The
<tt>sanitise</tt> function first checks the
<tt>Content-Type</tt> of the part, and if
there's a filename, it also checks that
filename's extension against a known-to-be-bad list.
If the message part is bad, we replace the message itself with a
short text description describing the now-removed part and clean out
the headers that are relevant. We set this message
part's <tt>Content-Type</tt> to
'<tt>text/plain</tt>' and remove other headers related to
the now-removed message.</P>

<p class="docText">Finally, we check whether the message is a multipart message. If so,
it means the message has subparts, so we recursively call the
<i>sanitise</i> function on each of them. We then replace
the payload with our list of sanitized subparts.</P>

<p class="docText">If you're interested in working further on this
recipe, the most important extra functionality, which is easy to add
with a small amount of work, might be to store the attached file in
some directory (instead of destroying all suspect attachments), and
give the user a link to that file. Also consider extending the check
in <i>sanitise</I> that filters dangerous attachments to
have it verify more than just the content type and file extension;
other headers may be able to carry known signs of worm or virus
messages.</p>
