<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-7.1"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You want to implement Python clients and servers for some distributed
processing task, without repetitious
"boilerplate" code, and with
excellent performance and scalability characteristics.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-SECT-7.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">Use the <span class="docEmphasis">Perspective Broker</span> (PB) subsystem of the
<span class="docEmphasis">Twisted</span> framework. A PB server just subclasses
the PB's <tt>Root</tt> class and adds
remotely callable methods. Here is an example of a server script
which adds just one remotely callable method, named
<i>Pong</I>:</p>

<pre>from twisted.spread import pb
from twisted.internet import reactor
PORT = 8992
class Ponger(pb.Root):
    def remote_Pong(self, ball):
        print 'CATCH', ball,
        ball += 1
        print 'THROW', ball
        return ball
reactor.listenTCP(PORT, pb.BrokerFactory(Ponger( )))
reactor.run( )</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">We could write an equally trivial script for the client side of the
interaction, but let's instead have a rather
feature-rich PB client, which deals with important issues often
ignored in introductory examples of distributed programming, such as
error handling:<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2985"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2986"></a></P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">Twisted is a framework for <i>asynchronous</i> (also
known as <span class="docEmphasis">event-driven</span>) programming of network
clients, servers, proxies, and so on. The asynchronous programming
model (which Twisted implements through the Reactor Design Pattern
embodied in the <tt>twisted.internet.reactor</tt> module)
provides excellent performance and scalability characteristics for
Twisted-based programs.</p>

<p class="docText">Twisted also includes many subsystems that offer your programs
ready-to-go networking functionality. One of these subsystems,
Perspective Broker (PB), is implemented in the
<tt>twisted.spread.pb</tt> module. PB lets you code
distributed-programming clients and servers, with an ease of use
that's most clearly displayed in the server program
at the start of this recipe's Solution. In just a
few lines of code, the server class is able to expose remotely
callable methods: all it takes is subclassing the
<tt>Root</tt> class of the <tt>pb</tt> module and
naming each remotely callable method with a prefix of
<tt>remote_</tt>.</p>

<p class="docText">Most of the client code in this recipe is concerned with diagnosing
and handling possible problems and errors with the connection to the
server. Specifically, if the connection fails for any reason,
including a timeout diagnosed by the watchdog timer that the client
sets up each time it pings, the client attempts to reconnect to the
server. If you kill the server, the client keeps trying to reconnect,
periodically, until you restart the server.</P>

<p class="docText">Error-handling apart, the client is essentially as simple as the
server. In the method <i>_start</i>, the client calls
function <tt>getObjectAt</tt> of module
<tt>twisted.spread.pb</tt>, which takes as its arguments
the server's host, a port number, and a
"time-out" delay in seconds. As
usual in Python networking, the host can be either a network name,
such as <tt>localhost</tt>, or a string representing an IP
address, such as <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>.</P>

<p class="docText">If no problems arise, <tt>getObjectAt</tt> returns an
object that proxies for the remote PB server. The proxy object, in
turn, has a <tt>callRemote</tt> method, which takes as its
arguments the method name as a string, followed by any arguments you
are passing to the remote method. <tt>callRemote</tt>
returns a Twisted <tt>deferred</tt> object, the lynchpin of
Twisted's style of asynchronous (event-driven)
programming. Learning to use <tt>deferred</tt>s effectively
is the fundamental step in learning to program with Twisted.</p>

<p class="docText">A <tt>deferred</tt> object represents an event that may
occur in the future (the <I>success-case</i>) or may
end in failure. Given a <tt>deferred</tt>, you can add
callbacks to it for both success and failure cases. (You can also
<span class="docEmphasis">chain</span> callbacks, a possibility that this recipe
does not exploit.) When the
<tt>deferred</tt>'s event occurs,
<span class="docEmphasis">Twisted</span> calls your
"success-case" callback, passing as
its argument the "result" of the
<tt>deferred</tt>. Alternatively, if the
<tt>deferred</tt> ends in failure,
<span class="docEmphasis">Twisted</span> calls your
<I>failure-case</I> callback, passing as its argument
a failure object that wraps a Python exception object.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2987"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-15-ITERM-2988"></a></p>

<p class="docText">As you see in this recipe, despite
<tt>deferred</tt>s' potentially rich and
vast functionality, their use is really quite simple in most cases.
For example, in the failure cases, the client in this recipe wants to
retry connecting: therefore, method <i>_remoteFail</i>
accepts the failure-object argument with an argument name of
"two underscores" (<i>_
_</i>), a common Python convention that indicates the argument
will be ignored.</p>
