<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-16-ITERM-3036"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-16-ITERM-3037"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-16-ITERM-3038"></a>You often use <tt>py2exe</tt>
to build Windows <I>.exe</i> files from Python scripts,
but you don't want to bother writing a
<I>setup.py</i> build script for each and every such
script.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-16-SECT-11.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText"><tt>distutils</tt><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-16-ITERM-3039"></a> is a package in the standard Python
library, ready to be imported from your Python code.
<tt>py2exe</tt> is a third-party extension to
<tt>distutils</tt> for the specific task of generating
Windows executables from Python code: you must download and install
<tt>py2exe</tt> separately, but once installed, it
cooperates smoothly with the standard <tt>distutils</tt>.
Thanks to these features, you can easily write Python scripts to
automate <tt>distutils</tt> tasks (including
<tt>py2exe</tt> tasks). For example:</P>

<pre>from distutils.core import setup
import sys, os, py2exe
# the key trick with our arguments and Python's sys.path
name = sys.argv[1]
sys.argv[1] = 'py2exe'
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(name)))
setup(name=name[:-3], scripts=[name])</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Save this as <I>makexe.py</I> in the
<i>Tools\Scripts\</i> folder of your Python
installation. (You should always add this folder to your Windows
<tt>PATH</tt> because it contains many useful tools.) Now,
from a Windows command prompt, you're able to
<tt>cd</tt> to a directory where you have placed a script
(say <i>C:\MyDir\</i>), and there run, say:</P>

<pre>C:\MyDir&gt; makexe.py myscript.py</pre><br>


<p class="docText">and (assuming that you have a <i>myscript.py</I> script
there, and <i>.py</I> among your Windows executable
extensions, with association to the Python interpreter)
<tt>py2exe</tt> prepares all the files you need for
distributing your masterpiece (as a Windows executable and supporting
DLLs), neatly arranged in folder
<i>c:\MyDir\dist\myscript\</I>.</P>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">The <tt>distutils</tt> package is part of the Python
Standard Library. It helps you prepare your Python modules and
extensions for distribution, as well as letting you install such
packages as distributed by others. <tt>py2exe</tt> is a
freely downloadable third-party extension that works on top of
<tt>distutils</tt> to help you build a Windows
<i>.exe</i> file (and a set of supporting DLL files)
from a Python-coded program, so that you can distribute your program
in executable form to other Windows PCs that may not have Python
installed; see <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/">http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/</a>,
both to download <tt>py2exe</tt> and for detailed
documentation of this useful tool.</p>

<p class="docText">Following the details given in the <tt>distutils</tt> (and
<tt>py2exe</tt>) documentation, the canonical way to use
<tt>distutils</tt> (including <tt>py2exe</tt>) is
to write a script, conventionally always named
<i>setup.py</i>, to perform all kinds of
<tt>distutils</tt> tasks on your package. Normally, you
write a <i>setup.py</i> for each package you
distribute, placing it in the top directory of the package (known as
the <span class="docEmphasis">distribution root</span> in
<tt>distutils</tt> terminology).</p>

<p class="docText">However, there is nothing mandatory about the convention of writing a
<i>setup.py</i> script per package.
<tt>distutils</tt> and <tt>py2exe</tt>, after
all, are written as modules to be imported from Python. So, you can,
if you so choose, use all the power of Python to code scripts that
help you perform <tt>distutils</tt> and
<tt>py2exe</tt> tasks in whatever ways you find most
convenient.</p>

<p class="docText">This recipe shows how I eliminate the need to write a separate
<I>setup.py</I> script for each Python script that I
convert to an executable with <tt>py2exe</tt>, and related
issues such as the need to keep such scripts in dedicated
"distribution root" directories. I
suggest you name this recipe's script
<i>makexe.py</i>, but any name will do, as long as you
avoid naming it <I>py2exe.py</i> (a natural enough
temptation). (Naming it <i>py2exe.py </i>would break
the script because the script must <tt>import py2exe</tt>,
and if you named the script <i>py2exe.py</i> it would
"import itself" instead!)</p>

<p class="docText">Place this script on any directory on your Windows
<tt>PATH</tt> where you normally keep executable Python
scripts. I suggest you use the <I>Tools\Scripts</i>
folder of the Python distribution, a folder that contains several
other useful scripts you'll want to have handy (have
a look in that folderit's worth your time).
I'm not going to delve into the details of how to
set and examine your Windows <tt>PATH</tt>, open a command
prompt, make your Python scripts executable, and so on. Such system
administration details differ slightly on each version of Windows,
and you'll need to master them for any Windows
version on which you want to perform significant programming, anyway.</P>

<p class="docText">Once you have implemented this Solution, you'll find
that making your Python scripts into Windows executables has become
so easy and so fast that soon you'll be distributing
your neat and useful programs to friends and acquaintances right and
left. You won't need to convince them to install the
Python runtime files before they can install and run your programs,
either! (Of course, in this way they <span class="docEmphasis">will</span> end up
with what amounts to several copies of the runtime files, if they
install several of your compiled programsthere is little you
can do about that.)</p>
