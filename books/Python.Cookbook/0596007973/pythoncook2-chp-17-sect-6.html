<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">The two best ways for your C-coded, Python-callable extension
functions to accept generic Python sequences as arguments are
<tt>PySequence_Fast</tt> and
<tt>PyObject_GetIter</tt>. The latter, which I cover in the
next recipe, can often save some memory, but it is appropriate only
when it's OK for the rest of your C code to get the
items one at a time, without knowing beforehand how many items there
will be in total. You often have preexisting C functions from an
existing library that you want to expose to Python code, and such
functions may require C arrays as their input arguments. Thus, this
recipe shows how to build a C array (in this case, an array of
<tt>double</tt>) from a generic Python sequence (or other
iterable) argument, so that you can pass the array (and the integer
that gives the array's length) to your existing C
function (represented here, purely as an example, by the
<I>total</i> function at the start of the recipe). (In the
real world, you would use Python's built-in function
<tt>sum</tt> for this specific functionality, rather than
exposing any existing C function (but this <span class="docEmphasis">is</span>
meant to be just an example!)</P>

<p class="docText"><tt>PySequence_Fast</tt> takes two arguments: a Python
iterable object to be presented as a sequence, and a string to use as
the error message in case the Python object cannot be presented as a
sequence, in which case <tt>PySequence_Fast</tt> returns
<tt>0</tt> (the C null pointer, <tt>NULL</tt>, an
error indicator). If the Python object is already a list or tuple,
<tt>PySequence_Fast</tt> returns the same object with the
reference count increased by one. If the Python object is any other
kind of sequence (or any iterator, or other iterable),
<tt>PySequence_Fast</tt> builds and returns a new tuple
with all items already in place. In any case,
<tt>PySequence_Fast</tt> returns an object on which you can
call <tt>PySequence_Fast_GET_SIZE</tt> to obtain the
sequence length (as we do in the recipe, in order to
<tt>malloc</tt> the appropriate amount of storage for the C
array) and <tt>PySequence_Fast_GET_ITEM</tt> to get an item
given a valid index (an <tt>int</tt> between 0, included,
and the sequence length, excluded).</P>

<p class="docText">The recipe requires quite a bit of care (as is typical of all C-coded
Python extensions, and more generally of any C code) to deal properly
with memory issues and error conditions. For C-coded Python
extensions, in particular, it's imperative that you
know which Python C API functions return <span class="docEmphasis">new</span>
references (which you must <tt>Py_DECREF</tt> when you are
done with them) and which ones return <span class="docEmphasis">borrowed</span>
references (which you must not <tt>Py_DECREF</tt> when
you're done with them; on the contrary, you must
<tt>Py_INCREF</tt> such a reference if you want to keep a
copy for a longer time). In this specific case, you have to know the
following (by reading the Python documentation):</p>

<ul><li><p class="docList"><tt>PyArg_ParseTuple</tt> produces borrowed references.</p></LI><li><p class="docList"><tt>PySequence_Fast</tt> returns a new reference.</p></LI><li><p class="docList"><tt>PySequence_Fast_GET_ITEM</tt> returns a borrowed
reference.</P></li><LI><p class="docList"><tt>PyNumber_Float</tt> returns a new reference.</P></li></ul>
<p class="docText">There is method to this madness, even though, as you start your
career as a coder of C API Python extensions, you'll
no doubt have to double-check each case carefully.
Python's C API strives to return borrowed references
(for the sake of the modest performance increase that they afford, by
avoiding needless incrementing and decrementing of reference counts),
when it <span class="docEmphasis">knows</span> it can always do so safely (i.e.,
it knows that the reference it is returning necessarily refers to an
already existing object). However, Python's C API
has to return a new reference when it's possible (or
certain) that a new object may have to be created.</p>

<p class="docText">For example, in the preceding list, <tt>PyNumber_Float</tt>
and <tt>PySequence_Fast</tt> may be able to return the same
object they were given as an argument, but it's also
quite possible that they may have to create a new object for this
purpose, to ensure that the returned object has the correct type.
Therefore, these two functions are specified as always returning new
references. <tt>PyArg_ParseTuple</tt> and
<tt>PySequence_Fast_GET_ITEM</tt>, on the other hand,
always return references to objects that already exist elsewhere (as
items in the arguments' tuple, or as items in the
fast-sequence container, respectively). Therefore, these two
functions can afford to return borrowed references and are thus
specified as doing so.</p>

<p class="docText">One last note: in this recipe, as soon as we obtain an item from the
fast-sequence container, we immediately try to transform it into a
Python <tt>float</tt> object, and thus we have to deal with
the possibility that the transformation will fail (e.g., if
we're passed a sequence containing a string, a
complex number, etc.). It is most often futile to first attempt a
check (with <tt>PyNumber_Check</tt>) because the check
might succeed, and the later transformation attempt might fail anyway
(e.g., with a complex-number item). Therefore, it's
better to attempt the transformation and deal with the resulting
error, if any. This approach is yet another case of the common
situation in which it's easier to get forgiveness
than permission!</p>

<p class="docText">As usual, the best way to build this extension (assuming e.g., that
you've saved the extension's source
code as a file named <i>total.c</i>) is with the
<tt>distutils</tt> package. Place a file named
<i>setup.py</i> in the same directory as the C source:</p>

<pre>from distutils.core import setup, Extension
setup(name="total", maintainer="Luther Blissett", maintainer_email=
    "situ@tioni.st", ext_modules=[Extension('total', sources=['total.c'])]
)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">then build and install by running:</p>

<pre>$ python setup.py install</pre><br>


<p class="docText">An appealing aspect of this approach is that it works on any
platform, assuming that you have access to the same C compiler used
to build your version of Python, and permission to write on the
<I>site-packages</I> directory where the resulting
dynamically loaded library gets installed.</p>
