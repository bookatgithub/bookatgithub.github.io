<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-ITERM-3109"></a>You have numbers coming from
measurements affected by known percentual uncertainties, and you want
to perform arithmetic on these numbers while tracking the uncertainty
in the results.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-14.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">The simplest approach is to code a class that implements arithmetic
operators applying the classical physicists'
error-propagation formulas:</p>

<pre>import math
class Measurement(object):
    ''' models a measurement with % uncertainty, provides arithmetic '''
    def _ _init_ _(self, val, perc):
        self.val = val                            # central value
        self.perc = perc                          # % uncertainty
        self.abs = self.val * self.perc / 100.0   # absolute error
    def _ _repr_ _(self):
        return "Measurement(%r, %r)" % (self.val, self.perc)
    def _ _str_ _(self):
        return "%g+-%g%%" % (self.val, self.perc)
    def _addition_result(self, result, other_abs):
        new_perc = 100.0 * (math.hypot(self.abs, other_abs) / result)
        return Measurement(result, new_perc)
    def _ _add_ _(self, other):
        result = self.val + other.val
        return self._addition_result(result, other.abs)
    def _ _sub_ _(self, other):
        result = self.val - other.val
        return self._addition_result(result, other.abs)
    def _multiplication_result(self, result, other_perc):
        new_perc = math.hypot(self.perc, other_perc)
        return Measurement(result, new_perc)
    def _ _mul_ _(self, other):
        result = self.val * other.val
        return self._multiplication_result(result, other.perc)
    def _ _div_ _(self, other):
        result = self.val / other.val
        return self._multiplication_result(result, other.perc)</pre><BR>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">Here is a typical example of use for this
<I>Measurement</i> class:</P>

<pre>m1 = Measurement(100.0, 5.5)   # measured value of 100.0 with 5.5% error
m2 = Measurement(50, 2)        # measured value of 50.0 with 2% error
print "m1 = ", m1
print "m2 = ", m2
print "m1 + m2 = ", m1 + m2
print "m1 - m2 = ", m1 - m2
print "m1 * m2 = ", m1 * m2
print "m1 / m2 = ", m1 / m2
print "(m1+m2) * (m1-m2) = ", (m1+m2) * (m1-m2)
print "(m1-m2) / (m1+m2) = ", (m1-m2) / (m1+m2)
# emits:
# <B>m1 =  100+-5.5%</b>
# <b>m2 =  50+-2%</b>
# <b>m1 + m2 =  150+-3.72678%</b>
# <b>m1 - m2 =  50+-11.1803%</b>
# <b>m1 * m2 =  5000+-5.85235%</b>
# <B>m1 / m2 =  2+-5.85235%</b>
# <b>(m1+m2) * (m1-m2) =  7500+-11.7851%</b>
# <b>(m1-m2) / (m1+m2) =  0.333333+-11.7851%</b></pre><BR>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-ITERM-3110"></a>What is
commonly known as a <i>percentage error</I> is of
course best described as a <i>percentage of
uncertainty</I>. For example, when we state that some
measured quantity is 100 with an error of 5.5% (or, equivalently,
5.5%), we mean that we know, with a reasonable level of confidence,
that the quantity lies somewhere between 94.5 and 105.5. The
error-propagation formulas are somewhat heuristic, rather than
rigorous, but they're quite traditional and have
proven over the centuries that they perform acceptably in most large
computations in physics or engineering.</P>

<p class="docText">Class <i>Measurement</i>, as shown in this recipe, does not
support arithmetic with <tt>float</tt>sonly
arithmetic between instances of <i>Measurement</i>. For
those rare occasions when I need, in such computations, numbers that
are known "exactly", it is easiest
to input them as "measurements with an error of
0%". For example, if I have measured some
sphere's radius as 1 meter +- 3%, I can compute the
sphere's volume (with the well-known formula, 4/3
<tt>pi</tt> times the cube of the radius) as follows:</p>

<pre>r = Measurement(1, 3)
v = Measurement(4/3.0*math.pi, 0) * r * r * r
print v
# emits: <b>4.18879+-5.19615%</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">Avoiding <span class="docEmphasis">accidental</span> operations with floats that
are presumed to be exact, but in fact are not, is quite helpful: this
way, when I need to state that a certain number has 0 error,
I'm reminded to consider whether things
<span class="docEmphasis">are</span> truly that way. If your applications are
different, so that you do need operations between measurements and
exact floats all over the place, you can insert, as the first line of
every one of the arithmetic special methods, the following statement:</p>

<pre>        if isinstance(other, float):
            other = Measurement(other, 0)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Alternatively, you could perform this coercion in a special method
named <tt>_ _coerce_ _</tt>, but that approach is
considered obsolete and is discouraged in modern Python. If you do
perform the coercion in the various arithmetic special methods
(<tt>_ _add_ _</tt>, <tt>_ _sub_ _</tt>, etc.),
don't forget to also add the <tt>_ _radd_
_</tt>, etc, equivalentsafter all, if you want to be able
to code:</p>

<pre>    some_measurement * 2.0</pre><br>


<p class="docText">you will no doubt also want to be able to code:</p>

<pre>    2.0 * some_measurement</pre><br>


<p class="docText">and get exactly the same effects. For this purpose, in Python, your
class needs to define the various <tt>_ _r..</tt>. versions
of the operator special methods. However, I'm not
pursuing this line of reasoning further, because in most cases, you
will be best served by <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> having the implicit
ability to do arithmetic in an automatic way between measurements and
floatsmuch like, with Python 2.4's
<tt>decimal</tt> module, you can't
implicitly do arithmetic in an automatic way between decimal numbers
and floats.</P>
