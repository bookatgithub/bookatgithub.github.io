<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-ITERM-3118"></a>You have a list of 2D
points, represented as pairs (<tt><I>x</i></tt>,
<tt><I>y</i></tt>), and need to compute the
convex hull (i.e., upper and lower chains of vertices) and the
diameter (the two points farthest from each other).</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-17.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-ITERM-3119"></a>We can easily compute the hulls by the
classic <span class="docEmphasis">Graham's scan</span>
algorithm, with sorting based on coordinates rather than radially.
Here is a function to perform this task:</P>

<pre>def orientation(p, q, r):
    ''' &gt;0 if p-q-r are clockwise, &lt;0 if counterclockwise, 0 if colinear. '''
    return (q[1]-p[1])*(r[0]-p[0]) - (q[0]-p[0])*(r[1]-p[1])
def hulls(Points):
    ' Graham scan to find upper and lower convex hulls of a set of 2D points '
    U = [  ]
    L = [  ]
    # the natural sort in Python is lexicographical, by coordinate
    Points.sort( )
    for p in Points:
        while len(U) &gt; 1 and orientation(U[-2], U[-1], p) &lt;= 0:
            U.pop( )
        while len(L) &gt; 1 and orientation(L[-2], L[-1], p) &gt;= 0:
            L.pop( )
        U.append(p)
        L.append(p)
    return U, L</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-ITERM-3120"></a>Given the hulls, the
<span class="docEmphasis">rotating calipers</span> algorithm provides all pairs
of points that are candidates to be set's diameter.
Here is a function to embody this algorithm:</P>

<pre>def rotatingCalipers(Points):
    ''' Given a list of 2d points, finds all ways of sandwiching the points
        between two parallel lines that touch one point each, and yields the
        sequence of pairs of points touched by each pair of lines.  '''
    U, L = hulls(Points)
    i = 0
    j = len(L) - 1
    while i &lt; len(U) - 1 or j &gt; 0:
        yield U[i], L[j]
        # if all the way through one side of hull, advance the other side
        if i == len(U) - 1:
            j -= 1
        elif j == 0:
            i += 1
        # still points left on both lists, compare slopes of next hull edges
        # being careful to avoid divide-by-zero in slope calculation
        elif (U[i+1][1]-U[i][1]) * (L[j][0]-L[j-1][0]) &gt; \
             (L[j][1]-L[j-1][1]) * (U[i+1][0]-U[i][0]):
            i += 1
        else: j -= 1</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Given all the candidates, we need only to scan for the
<tt>max</tt> on pairwise point-point distances of candidate
pairs of points to get the diameter. Here is a function that performs
exactly this task:</p>

<pre>def diameter(Points):
    ''' Given a list of 2d points, returns the pair that's farthest apart. '''
    diam, pair = max( [((p[0]-q[0])**2 + (p[1]-q[1])**2, (p,q))
                      for p,q in rotatingCalipers(Points)] )
    return pair</pre><br>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">As function <I>hulls</i> shows, we can apply
Graham's scan algorithm without needing an expensive
radial sort as a preliminary step: Python's own
built-in sort (which is <i>lexicographical</I>,
meaning, in this case, by <i>x</I> coordinate first, and by
<i>y</I> coordinate when the <I>x</i> coordinates
of two points coincide) is sufficient.</p>

<p class="docText">From <i>hulls</i>, we get the upper and lower convex hulls
as distinct lists, which, in turn, helps in the
<i>rotatingCalipers</i> function: that function can
maintain separate indices <tt><i>i</i></tt> and
<tt><i>j</i></tt> on the lower and upper hulls and still
be sure to yield all pairs of <span class="docEmphasis">sandwich boundary</span>
points that are candidates to be the set's diameter.
Given the sequence of candidate pairs, function
<i>diameter</i>'s task is quite
simpleit boils down to one call to built-in
<tt>max</tt> on a list comprehension (a generator
expression would suffice in Python 2.4) that associates the pairwise
point distance to each pair of candidate points. We use the
<span class="docEmphasis">squared</span> distance, in fact.
There's no reason to compute a costly square root to
get the actual non-squared distance: we're comparing
only distances, and for any non-negative <tt><i>x</I></tt>
and <tt><I>y</i></tt>,
<tt><i>x</I></tt> <tt>&lt;</tt>
<tt><i>y</i></tt> and
<tt>sqrt(</tt><tt><i>x</i></tt><tt>) &lt;
sqrt(</tt><tt><i>y</i></tt><tt>)</tt>
always have identical truth values. (In practice, however, using
<tt>math.hypot(</tt><tt><I>p</i></tt><tt>[</tt><tt><I>0</i></tt><tt>]-</tt><tt><I>q</i></tt><tt>[</tt><tt><I>0</I></tt><tt>]</tt>,
<tt><i>p</I></tt><tt>[1]-</tt><tt><I>q</i></tt><tt>[1])</tt>
in the list comprehension gives us just about the same performance.)</p>

<p class="docText">The computations in this recipe take care to handle tricky cases,
such as pairs of points with the same <tt><i>x</i></tt>
coordinate, multiple copies of the same point, colinear triples of
points, and slope computations that, if not carefully handled, would
produce a division by zero (i.e., again, pairs of points with the
same <tt><I>x</i></tt> coordinate). The set of unit tests
that carefully probe each of these corner cases is far longer than
the code in the recipe itself, which is why it's not
posted on this cookbook.</p>

<p class="docText">Some of the formulas become a little simpler and more readable when
we represent points by complex numbers, rather than as pairs of
reals:</P>

<pre>def orientation(p, q, r):
    return ((q - p) * (r - p).conjugate( )).imag
<i>...</I>
        # still points left on both lists, compare slopes of next hull edges
        # being careful to avoid divide-by-zero in slope calculation
        elif ((U[i+1] - U[i]) * (L[j] - L[j-1]).conjugate( )).imag &gt; 0:
            i += 1
        else: j -= 1
<i>...</I>
def diameter(Points):
    diam, pair = max([(abs(p-q), (p,q)) for p,q in rotatingCalipers(Points)])
    return pair</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">If we represent points by complex numbers, of course, we cannot just
use <tt>Points.sort( )</tt> any more because complex
numbers cannot be compared. We need to "pay
back" some of the simplification by coding our own
sort, such as:</p>

<pre>    aux = [ (p.real, p.imag) for p in Points ]
    aux.sort( )
    Points[:] = [ complex(*p) for p in aux ]
    del aux</pre><br>


<p class="docText">or equivalently, in Python 2.4:</p>

<pre>    Points.sort(key=lambda p: p.real, p.imag)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Moreover, under the hood, a complex numbers-based version is doing
more arithmetic: finding the real as well as imaginary components in
the first and second formula, and doing an unnecessary square root in
the third one. Nevertheless, performance as measured on my machine,
despite this extra work, turns out to be slightly
<span class="docEmphasis">better</span> with this latest snippet than with the
"Solution"'s code.
The reason I've not made the complex-numbers
approach the "official" one, aside
from the complication with sorting, is that you should not require
familiarity with complex arithmetic just to understand geometrical
computations.</p>

<p class="docText">If you're comfortable with complex numbers,
don't mind the sorting issues, and have to perform
many 2D geometrical computations, you should consider representing
points as complex numbers and check whether this provides a
performance boost, as well as overall simplification to your source
code. Among other advantages, representing points as complex numbers
lets you use the <tt>Numeric</tt> package to hold your
data, saving much memory and possibly gaining even more performance,
when compared to the natural alternative of representing points as
(<tt><i>x</i></tt>, <tt><i>y</i></tt>) tuples
holding two <tt>float</tt>s.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-ITERM-3121"></a></p>
