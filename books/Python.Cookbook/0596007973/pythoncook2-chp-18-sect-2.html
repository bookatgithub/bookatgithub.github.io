<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Credit: Alex Martelli</span></p>

<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-2.1"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You have a sequence that may include duplicates, and you want to
remove the duplicates in the fastest possible way. Moreover, the
output sequence must respect the item ordering of the input sequence.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-2.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">The need to respect the item ordering of the input sequence means
that picking unique items becomes a problem quite different from that
explored previously in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-1.html#pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-1">Recipe 18.1</a>. This requirement often
arises in conjunction with a function <tt><i>f</I></tt>
that defines an equivalence relation among items:
<tt><i>x</I></tt> is equivalent to
<tt><I>y</i></tt> if and only if
<tt><I>f</I></tt><tt>(</tt><tt><i>x</i></tt><tt>)==</tt><tt><i>f</i></tt><tt>(</tt><tt><I>y</i></tt><tt>)</tt>.
In this case, the task of removing duplicates may often be better
described as picking the first representative of each resulting
equivalence class. Here is a function to perform this task:</p>

<pre># support 2.3 as well as 2.4
try: set
except NameError: from sets import Set as set
# f defines an equivalence relation among items of sequence seq, and
# f(x) must be hashable for each item x of seq
def uniquer(seq, f=None):
    """ Keeps earliest occurring item of each f-defined equivalence class """
    if f is None:    # f's default is the identity function f(x) -&gt; x
        def f(x): return x
    already_seen = set( )
    result = [  ]
    for item in seq:
        marker = f(item)
        <span class="docEmphBold">if marker not in already_seen</span>:
             <span class="docEmphBold">already_seen.add(marker)</span>
             <span class="docEmphBold">result.append(item)</span>
    return result</pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-2.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">The previous <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-1.html#pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-1">Recipe 18.1</a> is
applicable only if you are not concerned about item ordering or, in
other words, if the sequences involved are meaningful only as the
sets of their items, which is often the case. When sequential order
is significant, a different approach is needed.</p>

<p class="docText">If the items are hashable, it's not hard to maintain
sequence order, keeping only the first occurrence of each value. More
generally, we may want uniqueness within equivalence classes, as
shown in this recipe's Solution: the
<I>uniquer</I> function accepts as an argument a function
<tt><i>f</i></tt> that must return hashable objects, such
that
<tt><i>f</i></tt><tt>(</tt><tt><i>x</i></tt><tt>)==</tt><tt><i>f</i></tt><tt>(</tt><tt><i>y</i></tt><tt>)</tt>
if and only if items <tt><i>x</i></tt> and
<tt><i>y</I></tt> are equivalent. Identity (in the
mathematical sense, not in the Python sense) is used as the default
when no argument <tt><I>f</i></tt> is supplied. The added
generality of allowing an <tt><i>f</I></tt> different from
the identity function costs no added complication whatsoever.</p>

<p class="docText">If you need to keep the last occurrence, rather than the earliest
occurrence, of an item in each equivalence class, the simplest
approach is to <tt>reverse</tt> the input sequence (or,
rather, a copy thereof into a local list, since the input might be
immutable or at any rate not support reversing), then, after
processing with <i>uniquer</i>, <tt>reverse</tt>
the resulting list:</p>

<pre>def uniquer_last(seq, f=None):
    seq = list(seq)
    seq.reverse( )
    result = uniquer(seq, f)
    result.reverse( )
    return result</pre><br>


<p class="docText">In Python 2.4, instead of the first three statements of this version
of <i>uniquer_last</I>, you could use the single statement:</p>

<pre>    result = uniquer(reversed(seq), f)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">exploiting the new built-in <tt>reversed</tt>. However,
this Python 2.4 version, while marginally faster, is less general,
because it does require <i>seq</I> to be really a sequence,
while the previously shown version (and the
<tt>uniquer</tt> function in the
"Solution") work with any
<span class="docEmphasis">iterable</span> <i>seq</I>. For example:</P>

<pre>    somelines = uniquer_last(open('my.txt'), str.lower)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">binds name <tt><I>somelines</I></tt> to the list of unique
lines from text file <i>my.txt</i>, considering two
lines equivalent if they're equal aside from
uppercase and lowercase distinctions, picking the last occurring one
from each set of equivalent lines, and preserving the order of the
lines in the file (phew). If you used Python 2.4's
built-in <tt>reversed</tt>, this latest snippet would not
work, due to <tt>reversed</tt>'s
prerequisites.</p>

<p class="docText">If you must deal with nonhashable items, the simplest fallback
approach is to use a set-like container that supports the
<tt>add</tt> method and membership testing without
requiring items to be hashable. Unfortunately, performance will be
<span class="docEmphasis">much</span> worse than with a real
<tt>set</tt>. Here's the simplest fallback
implementation, which demands of items nothing but support for
equality testing:</p>

<pre>def uniquer_with_simplest_fallback(seq, f=None):
    if f is None:
        def f(x): return x
    already_seen = set( )
    result = [  ]
    for item in seq:
        marker = f(item)
        try:
            new_marker = marker not in already_seen
        except TypeError:
            class TotallyFakeSet(list):
                add = list.append
            already_seen = TotallyFakeSet(already_seen)
            new_marker = marker not in already_seen
         if new_marker:
             already_seen.add(marker)
             result.append(item)
    return result</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">A more refined approach would be to use two levels of fallback, the
intermediate one based on sorting, as shown previously in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-1.html#pythoncook2-CHP-18-SECT-1">Recipe 18.1</a> testing in a sorted
list can be performed efficiently by using the Python Standard
Library module <tt>bisect</tt>.</p>

<p class="docText">However, remember that you can often use an
<tt><i>f</I></tt> that gives you hashable markers for
nonhashable items. The built-in function <tt>repr</tt> can
often be useful for this purpose. For example:</p>

<pre>lol = [ [1, 2], [  ], [1, 2], [3], [  ], [3, 4], [1, 2], [  ], [2, 1] ]
print uniquer(lol, repr)
# emits: <B>[[1, 2], [  ], [3], [3, 4], [2, 1]]</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">While the items of <tt><I>lol</I></tt> are lists, and thus
are not hashable, the built-in function <tt>repr</tt>
produces representations of each of the items as a string, which
<span class="docEmphasis">is</span> hashable. This enables use of the fast
function <i>uniquer</i>. Unfortunately,
<tt>repr</tt> is not useful for nonhashable items of other
types, including <tt>dict</tt> and <tt>set</tt>.
Because of the workings of hash-collision resolution,
it's quite possible to have
<tt><i>d1</i></tt><tt>==</tt><tt><i>d2</i></tt>
and yet
<tt>repr(</tt><tt><i>d1</i></tt><tt>)!=repr(</tt><tt><i>d2</i></tt><tt>)</tt>
for two dictionaries <tt><i>d1</i></tt> and
<tt><i>d2</I></tt>, depending on the exact sequences of
adds that built each <tt>dict</tt>. Still, you may be able
build your own <tt>repr</tt>-like function to work around
these issues, depending on the exact nature of your data. Whether
<tt>repr</tt> can help for instances of a certain
user-defined type depends on how accurately and usefully that
specific type defines special method <tt>_ _repr_ _</tt>,
which <tt>repr</tt> calls.</P>

<p class="docText">The task of picking one representative item, out of all of those
belonging to each equivalence class, can be generalized. Instead of
the simple ideas of implicitly picking the first such item, or the
last such item, we can choose among multiple items in the same
equivalence class via an arbitrary <i>picking</i>
function <tt><I>p</i></tt> that considers both the actual
items and their indexes of occurrence. As long as function
<tt><i>p</i></tt> can operate pairwise, the key idea is
just to keep a dictionary that maps the marker of each equivalence
class to the index and item of the representative so far picked for
that class. At the end, we reconstruct sequence order by sorting on
the indices:</p>

<pre>def fancy_unique(seq, f, p):
    """ Keeps "best" item of each f-defined equivalence class, with
        picking function p doing pairwise choice of (index, item) """
    representative = {  }
    for index, item in enumerate(seq):
        marker = f(item)
        if marker in representative:
            # It's NOT a problem to rebind index and item within the
            # for loop: the next leg of the loop does not use their binding
            index, item = p((index, item), representative[marker])
        representative[marker] = index, item
    # reconstruct sequence order by sorting on indices
    auxlist = representative.values( )
    auxlist.sort( )
    return [item for index, item in auxlist]</pre><br>


<p class="docText">It's possible that the picking function cannot
operate pairwise, but rather must be presented with the whole bunch
of <tt>(</tt><tt><i>index</I></tt>,
<tt><i>item</I></tt><tt>)</tt> pairs
for each equivalence class in order to pick the best representative
of that class (e.g., it may have to get the
<span class="docEmphasis">median</span> of the items in each class as being the
best representative of that class). Then we need one pass over the
sequence to collect the bunches, followed by a pass over the bunches,
to pick the representatives:</p>

<pre>def fancier_uniquer(seq, f, p):
    """ Keeps "best" item of each f-defined equivalence class, with
        picking function p choosing appropriate (index, item) for each
        equivalence class from the list of all (index, item) pairs in
        that class """
    bunches = {  }
    for index, item in enumerate(seq):
        marker = f(item)
        bunches.setdefault(marker, [  ]).append((index, item))
    auxlist = [p(candidates) for candidates in bunches.values( )]
    auxlist.sort( )
    return [item for index, item in auxlist]</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">These fancy approaches that rely on a picking function are useful
only for substantial equivalence functions, not for identity, so I
removed <tt><i>f</I></tt>'s default value
from these versions.</P>

<p class="docText">An example of use for <tt>fancy_unique</tt> may help. Say
we're given a list of words, and we need to get a
sublist from it, respecting order, such that no two words on the
sublist begin with the same letter. Out of all the words in the
"or"iginal list that begin with
each given letter, we need to keep the longest word and, in case of
equal lengths, the word appearing later on the list. This sounds
complicated, but with <i>fancy_unique</I> to help us,
it's really not that bad:</P>

<pre>def complicated_choice(words):
    def first_letter(aword):
        return aword[0].lower( )
    def prefer((indx1, word1), (indx2, word2)):
        if len(word2) &gt; len(word1):
            return indx2, word2
        return indx1, word1
    return fancy_unique(words, first_letter, prefer)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The <i>prefer</i> nested function within
<i>complicated_choice</I> is simplified because it knows
<i>fancy_unique</i> always calls it with
<tt>indx2&lt;indx1</tt>. So, the older <tt>indx2,
word2</tt> pair must be returned only when
<tt><I>word2</i></tt> is longer than
<tt><I>word1</i></tt>; otherwise, <tt>indx1,
word1</tt> is always the proper result. The automatic tuple
unpacking in <I>prefer</I>'s signature is
debatable, stylewise, but I like it (it reminds me of SML or
Haskell).</p>

<p class="docText">Out of all the general programming techniques presented in the
various functions of this recipe, the idea of writing higher-order
functions, which organize a computation and appropriately call back
to functions that they receive as arguments, is easily the most
precious and widely applicable concept. This idea is well worth
keeping in mind in several circumstancesnot just for old
Haskell-heads, because it works just as well in Python.</p>
