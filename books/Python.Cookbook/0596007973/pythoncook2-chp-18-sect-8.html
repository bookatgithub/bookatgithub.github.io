<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-18-ITERM-3095"></a>You need a
<tt>set</tt>-like collection type that lets each element be
in the set a number of times. In other words, you need a collection
type of the kind that is known as <tt>multiset</tt> in C++
and SQL, and <tt>bag</tt> in Smalltalk, Objective C, and
Haskell's <tt>Edison</tt> module.</P>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">We can implement <tt>bag</tt> as a class. We could restrict
the implementation to language constructs that are present in Python
2.3 or are easy to emulate; however, such restrictions would give
substantial inefficiencies or complications with comparison to a pure
Python 2.4 implementation. So, here is a Python 2.4 implementation,
with no attempt to support Python 2.3:</p>

<pre>from operator import itemgetter
from heapq import nlargest
class bag(object):
    def _ _init_ _(self, iterable=( )):
        # start empty, then add the `iterable' if any

        self.update(iterable)
    def update(self, iterable):
        # update from an element-&gt;count mapping, or from any iterable
        if isinstance(iterable, dict):
            for elem, n in iterable.iteritems( ):
                self[elem] += n
        else:
            for elem in iterable:
                self[elem] += 1

        # default all missing items to a count of 0
        return self._data.get(elem, 0)
    def _ _setitem_ _(self, elem, n):
        # setting an item to a count of 0 removes the item
        self._data[elem] = n
        if n == 0:
            del self._data[elem]
    def _ _delitem_ _(self, elem):
        # delegate to _ _setitem_ _ to allow deleting missing items
        self[elem] = 0
    def _ _len_ _(self):
        # length is computed on-the-fly
        return sum(self._data.itervalues( ))
    def _ _nonzero_ _(self):
        # avoid truth tests using _ _len_ _, as it's relatively slow
        return bool(self._data)
    def _ _eq_ _(self, other):

        return '%s(%r)' % (self._ _class_ _._ _name_ _, self._data)
    def copy(self):
        # make and return a shallow copy
        return self._ _class_ _(self._data)
    _ _copy_ _ = copy # For the copy module
    def clear(self):

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">Python offers several useful container classes, including built-in
<tt>tuple</tt>s, <I>list</i>s and
<tt>dict</tt>s, <tt>set</tt>s (in Python 2.4,
<tt>sets</tt> are built-in; in Python 2.3,
they're in module
<tt>sets</tt>)which, unlike <I>bag</I>s,
can be seen as "holding only one
instance" of each of their elementsand
double-ended queues, <tt>deque</tt>s (in Python 2.4 only,
in module <tt>collections</tt>). This abundance of
container classes doesn't mean there is no use for
yet more. The <tt>bag</tt>, (i.e., multiset), presented in
this recipe, is widely useful, since counting the numbers of
occurrences of different objects is a frequent task useful in many
applications. Rather than coding a <tt>bag</tt> each time
you need such a container (generally based on a dictionary mapping
items to counts), it's better to design and code it
once, put it among one's utilities, and lobby for it
to become part of the standard library for a future Python, such as
2.5 (which can be expected sometime in 2006 and will focus on
enhancements to the standard library rather than to the core
language).</p>

<p class="docText">The API offered by the <i>bag</i> class presented in this
recipe is largely based on indexing, due to the strong analogy
between a <tt>bag</tt> and a mapping of items to counts.
For example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = bag('banana')
&gt;&gt;&gt; b['a']
<B>3</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; b['a'] += 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b['a']
<b>4</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; del b['a']          # removes all 'a's from the bag
&gt;&gt;&gt; b['a']
<b>0</b></pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Items that are not in the <tt>bag</tt> can also be used as
indices, giving a value (i.e., count) of 0; a lot of
<i>bag</I>'s convenience comes from this
default. A <i>bag</I> also offers several ways to iterate
on it (by unique elements; by elements, each repeated as many times
as its count; by
<tt>(</tt><tt><I>element</i></tt>,
<tt><i>count</i></tt><tt>)</tt>
pairs); and also supplies a handy method <i>mostcommon</i>
to return
<tt>(</tt><tt><i>element</i></tt>,
<tt><i>count</i></tt><tt>)</tt> pairs
sorted by descending count (all such pairs, or just the top
<tt><i>n</i></tt>). An example use of
<i>mostcommon</i>:</P>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; bag(word for line in open('somefile.txt')
...     for word in line.split( )).mostcommon(5)
<B>[('to', 83), ('for', 71), ('the', 61), ('of', 53), ('and', 52)]</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">All design choices are tradeoffs. For some applications, it might be
more convenient to have <tt>bag</tt>'s API
closer to <tt>set</tt>'s rather than to
<tt>dict</tt>'s, with an
<tt>add</tt> method, and binary operators, for example, to
join two <tt>bags</tt> returning a new one (as
<tt>list</tt> does with operator <tt>+</tt> and
<tt>set</tt> does with the
"or", vertical-bar operator
<tt>|</tt>). In most cases, this would be overkill. After
all, "a designer knows he has achieved perfection,
not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left
to take away" (Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry).
So, for example, to join two <tt>bags</tt>, getting a new
one, without altering either input <tt>bag</tt>, code a
little function using roughly the same
<tt>update</tt>-based approach you would use with
<tt>dicts</tt>, as follows:</p>

<pre>def bagjoin(b1, b2):
    b = bag(b1)
    b.update(b2)
    return b</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Just as would be the case for an analogous function joining
<tt>dict</tt>s, this works, not only when
<tt><i>b1</i></tt> and <tt><i>b2</i></tt> are
<tt>bag</tt>s, but also when they are other kinds of
objects that can be passed to <tt>bag</tt> and
<tt>bag.update</tt>objects such as arbitrary
iterables or mappings (generally dictionaries) from items to counts.
Such polymorphism comes at negligible cost, and it's
well worth preserving.</p>

<p class="docText">Although the crucial design choices in this recipe are those about
<i>bag</I>'s API, some implementation
choices must be made as well. In this recipe's code,
implementation choices are oriented towards simplicity. In
particular, there is no attempt to allow this code to run on Python
2.3. This recipe is optimized for Python 2.4 because it is
Python's current release and is likely to be used
soon in lieu of Python 2.3, particularly among Pythonistas who are
sensitive to performance issues, given the amount of highly
successful effort that was devoted to optimizing version
2.4's performance. If Python 2.3 support was deemed
necessary, it would be best implemented separately, rather than
hobbling the primary 2.4 implementation with inefficiencies or
complications.</p>
