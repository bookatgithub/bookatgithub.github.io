<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-11.1"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You have a file that includes long logical lines split over two or
more physical lines, with backslashes to indicate that a continuation
line follows. You want to process a sequence of logical lines,
"rejoining" those split lines.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-11.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">As usual, our first idea for a problem involving sequences should be
a generator:</p>

<pre>def logical_lines(physical_lines, joiner=''.join):
    logical_line = [  ]
    for line in physical_lines:
        stripped = line.rstrip( )
        if stripped.endswith('\\'):
            # a line which continues w/the next physical line
            logical_line.append(stripped[:-1])
        else:
            # a line which does not continue, end of logical line
            logical_line.append(line)
            yield joiner(logical_line)
            logical_line = [  ]
    if logical_line:
        # end of sequence implies end of last logical line
        yield joiner(logical_line)
if _ _name_ _=='_ _main_ _':
    text = 'some\\\n', 'lines\\\n', 'get\n', 'joined\\\n', 'up\n'
    for line in text:
        print 'P:', repr(line)
    for line in logical_lines(text, ' '.join):
        print 'L:', repr(line)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">When run as a main script, this code emits:</p>

<pre>&lt;c&gt;P: 'some\\\n'
P: 'lines\\\n'
P: 'get\n'
P: 'joined\\\n'
P: 'up\n'
L: 'some lines get\n'
L: 'joined up\n'&lt;/c&gt;</pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-11.3"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">This problem is about sequence-bunching, just like the previous
<a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-10.html#pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-10">Recipe 19.10</a>. It is
therefore not surprising that this recipe, like the previous, is a
generator (with an internal structure quite similar to the one in the
"other" recipe): today, in Python,
sequences are often processed most simply and effectively by means of
generators.</P>

<p class="docText">In this recipe, the generator can encompass just a small amount of
generality without introducing extra complexity. Determining whether
a line is a continuation line, and of how to proceed when it is, is
slightly too idiosyncratic to generalize in a simple and transparent
way. I have therefore chosen to code that functionality inline, in
the body of the <I>logical_lines</i> generator, rather than
"factoring it out" into separate
callables. Remember, generality is good, but simplicity is even more
important. However, I have kept the simple and transparent generality
obtained by passing the <i>joiner</i> function as an
argument, and the snippet of code under the <tt>if _ _name_ _=
='_ _main_ _</tt>' test demonstrates how we may want to use that
generality, for example, to join continuation lines with a space
rather than with an empty string.</p>

<p class="docText">If you are certain that the file you're processing
is sufficiently small to fit comfortably in your
computer's memory, with room to spare for
processing, <span class="docEmphasis">and</span> you don't need
the feature (offered in the version of <I>logical_lines</i>
shown in the "Solution") of
ignoring whitespace to the right of a terminating
<tt>\\</tt>, a solution using a plain function rather than
a generator is simpler than the one shown in this
recipe's Solution:<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-ITERM-3127"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-ITERM-3128"></a></p>

<pre>def logical_lines(physical_lines, joiner=''.join, separator=''):
    return joiner(physical_lines).replace('\\\n', separator).splitlines(True)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">In this variant, we join all of the physical lines into one long
string, then we replace the
"canceled" line ends (line ends
immediately preceded by a backslash) with nothing (or any other
separator we're requested to use), and finally split
the resulting long string back into lines (keeping the line
endsthat's what the <tt>true</tt>
argument to method <tt>splitlines</tt> is for). This
approach is a very different one from that suggested in this recipe
but possibly worthwhile, if <I>physical_lines</i> is small
enough that you can afford the memory for it. I prefer the
"Solution"'s
approach because giving semantic significance to trailing whitespace
is a poor user interface design choice.</P>
