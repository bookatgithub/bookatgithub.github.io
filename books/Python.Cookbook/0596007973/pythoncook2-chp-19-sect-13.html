<h3 class="docSection1Title">Recipe 19.13. Fetching Large Record Sets from a Database with a Generator</h3>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-ITERM-3129"></a>You want to fetch a result set
from a database (using the Python DB API) and easily iterate over
each record in the result set. However, you don't
want to use the DB cursor's method
<tt>fetchall</tt>: it could consume a lot of memory and
would force you to wait until the whole result set comes back before
you can start iterating.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-13.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">A generator is the ideal solution to this problem:</p>

<pre>def fetchsome(cursor, arraysize=1000):
    ''' A generator that simplifies the use of fetchmany '''
    while True:
        results = cursor.fetchmany(arraysize)
        if not results: break
        for result in results:
            yield result</pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-13.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">In applications that use the Python DB API, you often see code that
goes somewhat like (where <I>cursor</i> is a DB API cursor
object):</P>

<pre>cursor.execute('select * from HUGE_TABLE')
for result in cursor.fetchall( ):
    doSomethingWith(result)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">This simple approach is "just"
fine, as long as <tt>fetchall</tt> returns a small result
set, but it does not work very well if the query result is very
large. A large result set can take a long time to return. Also,
<tt>cursor.fetchall( )</tt> needs to allocate enough memory
to store the entire result set in memory at once. Further, with this
simple approach, the <i>doSomethingWith</i> function
isn't going to get called until the entire
query's result finishes coming over from the
database to our program.</p>

<p class="docText">An alternative approach is to rely on the
<tt>cursor.fetchone</tt> method:</p>

<pre>for result in iter(cursor.fetchone, None):
    doSomethingWith(result)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">However, this alternative approach does not allow the database to
optimize the fetching process: most databases can exhibit better
efficiency when returning multiple records for a single query, rather
than returning records one at a time as <tt>fetchone</tt>
requires.</p>

<p class="docText">To let your applications obtain greater efficiency than
<tt>fetchone</tt> allows, without the risks of unbounded
memory consumption and delay connected to the use of
<tt>fetchall</tt>, Python's DB
API's cursors also have a
<tt>fetchmany</tt> method. However, the direct use of
<tt>fetchmany</tt> makes your iterations somewhat more
complicated than the simple <tt>for</tt> statements such as
those just shown. For example:</p>

<pre>while True:
    results = cursor.fetchmany(1000)
    if not results: break
    for result in results:
        doSomethingWith(result)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Python's generators are a great way to encapsulate
complicated iteration logic so that application code can just about
always loop with simple <tt>for</tt> statements. With this
recipe's <i>fetchsome</I> generator, you
get the same efficiencies and safeguards as with the native use of
the <tt>fetchmany</tt> method in the preceding snippet but
with the same crystal-clear simplicity as in the snippets that used
either <tt>fetchall</tt> or <tt>fetchone</tt>,
namely:</p>

<pre>for result in fetchsome(cursor):
    doSomethingWith(result)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">By default, <I>fetchsome</i> fetches up to 1,000 records at
a time, but you can change that number, depending on your
requirements. Optimal values can depend on schema, database type,
choice of Python DB API module. In general, you're
best advised to experiment with a few different values in your
specific settings if you need to optimize this specific aspect. (Such
experimentation is often a good idea for any optimization task.)</p>

<p class="docText">This recipe is clearly an example of a more general case: a
<span class="docEmphasis">subsequence unbuncher</span> generator that you can use
when you have a sequence of subsequences (each subsequence being
obtained through some call, and the end of the whole sequence being
indicated by an empty subsequence) and want to flatten it into a
simple, linear sequence of items. You can think of this unbunching
task as the reverse of the sequence-bunching tasks covered earlier in
<a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-10.html#pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-10">Recipe 19.10</a> and <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-11.html#pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-11">Recipe 19.11</a>, or as a simpler
variant of the sequence-flattening task covered in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-6.html#pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-6">Recipe 4.6</a>. A generator for unbunching
might be:</p>

<pre>def unbunch(next_subseq, *args):
    ''' un-bunch a sequence of subsequences into a linear sequence '''
    while True:
        subseq = next_subseq(*args)
        if not subseq: break
        for item in subseq:
            yield item</pre><br>


<p class="docText">As you can see, the structure of <i>unbunch</i> is
basically identical to that of the recipe's
<i>fetchsome</i>. Usage would also be just about the same:</p>

<pre>for result in unbunch(cursor.fetchmany, 1000):
    doSomethingWith(result)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">However, while it is important and instructive to consider this kind
of generalization, when you're writing applications
you're often better off using specific generators
that directly deal with your application's specific
needs. In this case, for example, calling
<tt>fetchsome(cursor)</tt> is more obvious and direct than
calling <tt>unbunch(cursor.fetchmany, 1000)</tt>, and
<i>fetchsome</i> usefully hides the usage of
<tt>fetchmany</tt> as well as the specific choice of
<tt>1,000</tt> as the subsequence size to fetch at each
step.</p>
