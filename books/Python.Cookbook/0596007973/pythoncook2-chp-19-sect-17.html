<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You have an iterator (or other iterable) object
<tt><I>x</i></tt>, and need to iterate twice over
<tt><I>x</i></tt>'s sequence of values.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-19-SECT-17.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">In Python 2.4, solving this problem is the job of function
<tt>tee</tt> in the standard library module
<tt>itertools</tt>:</P>

<pre>import itertools
x1, x2 = itertools.tee(x)
# you can now iterate on x1 and x2 separately</pre><br>


<p class="docText">In Python 2.3, you can code <tt>tee</tt> yourself:</P>

<pre>import itertools
def tee(iterable):
    def yield_with_cache(next, cache={  }):
        pop = cache.pop
        for i in itertools.count( ):
            try:
                yield pop(i)
            except KeyError:
                cache[i] = next( )
                yield cache[i]
    it = iter(iterable)
    return yield_with_cache(it.next), yield_with_cache(it.next)</pre><BR>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">The need to iterate repeatedly over the same sequence of values is a
reasonably common one. If you know that the sequence comes from a
list, or some other container that intrinsically lets you iterate
over its items repeatedly, then you simply perform the iteration
twice. However, sometimes your sequence may come from a generator, a
sequential file (which might, e.g., wrap a stream of data coming from
a network socketdata that you can read only once), or some
other iterator that is not intrinsically re-iterable. Even then, in
some cases, the best approach is the simplest onefirst save
the data into a list in memory, then repeatedly iterate over that
list:</p>

<pre>saved_x = list(x)
for item in saved_x: do_something(item)
for item in saved_x: do_something_else(item)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The simple approach of first saving all data from the iterator into a
list is not feasible for an infinite sequence
<tt><I>x</i></tt>, and may not be optimal if
<tt><i>x</I></tt> is very large and your separate
iterations over it never get far out-of-step from each other. In
these cases, the <i>tee</I> function shown in this recipe
can help. For example, say that the items of
<tt><i>x</I></tt> are either numbers or operators (the
latter being represented as strings such as '<tt>+</tt>',
'<tt>*</tt>', etc.). Whenever you encounter an operator,
you must output the result of applying that operator to all numbers
immediately preceding it (since the last operator). Using
<tt>tee</tt>, you could code:</P>

<pre>def is_operator(item):
    return isinstance(item, str)
def operate(x):
    x1, x2 = tee(iter(x))
    while True:
        for item in x1:
            if is_operator(item): break
        else:
            # we get here when there are no more operators in the input
            # stream, thus the operate function is entirely done
            return
        if item == '+':
            total = 0
            for item in x2:
                if is_operator(item): break
                total += item
            yield total
        elif item == '*':
            total = 1
            for item in x2:
                if is_operator(item): break
                total *= item
            yield total</pre><br>


<p class="docText">This kind of "look-ahead" usage is
pretty typical of many of the common use cases of
<tt>tee</tt>. Even in this case, you might choose the
alternative approach of accumulating items in a list:</p>

<pre>def operate_with_auxiliary_list(x):
    aux = [  ]
    for item in x:
        if is_operator(item):
            if item == '+':
                yield sum(aux)
            elif item == '*':
                total = 1
                for item in aux:
                    total *= item
                yield total
            aux = [  ]
        else:
            aux.append(item)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Having <tt>tee</tt> available lets you freely choose
between these different styles of look-ahead processing.</p>

<p class="docText">Function <tt>itertools.tee</tt> as implemented in Python
2.4 is faster and more general than the pure Python version given in
this recipe for version 2.3 usage. However, the pure Python version
is quite instructive and deserves study for the sake of the
techniques it demonstrates, even if you're lucky
enough to be using Python 2.4 and therefore don't
need to use this pure Python version of <i>tee</i>.</p>

<p class="docText">In the pure Python version of <i>tee</i>, the nested
generator <i>yield_with_cache</i> makes use of the fact
(which some consider a "wart" in
Python but is actually quite useful) that the default values of
arguments get computed just once, at the time the
<tt>def</tt> statement executes. Thus, both calls to the
nested generator in the <tt>return</tt> statement of
<i>tee</i> implicitly share the same initially empty
<tt>dict</tt> as the value of the <I>cache</I>
argument.</p>

<p class="docText"><tt>itertools.count</tt> returns non-negative integers,
<tt>0</tt> and up, one at a time.
<i>yield_with_cache</I> uses each of these integers as a
key into the <i>cache</i> dictionary. The call to
<tt>pop(i)</tt> (the argument of the
<tt>yield</tt> statement in the <tt>try</tt>
clause) simultaneously returns and removes the entry corresponding to
key <tt><i>i</i></tt>, <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> that entry
was presentthat is, in this case, if the
"other" instance of the generator
had already reached that point in the iteration (and cached the item
for our benefit). Otherwise, the <tt>except</tt> clause
executes, computes the item (by calling the object bound to name
<i>next</I>, which in this case is the
<tt>next</tt> bound method of an iterator over the iterable
object, which <tt>tee</tt> is duplicating), and caches the
item (for the "other"
instance's future benefit) before
<tt>yield</tt>ing it.</p>

<p class="docText">So, in practice, <I>cache</i> is being used as a FIFO
queue. Indeed, were it not for the fact that we
don't need a pure-Python <I>tee</i> in
Python 2.4, we could code an equivalent implementation of it in
Python 2.4 using the new type <tt>deque</tt> in standard
library module <tt>collections</tt>:</P>

<pre>import collections
def tee_just_an_example(iterable):
    def yield_with_cache(it, cache=collections.deque):
        while True:
            if cache:
                yield cache.popleft( )
            else:
                result = it.next( )
                cache.append(result)
                yield result
    it = iter(iterable)
    return yield_with_cache(it), yield_with_cache(it)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">This latest version is meant purely as an illustrative example, and
therefore, it's simplified by not using any of the
bound-method extraction idioms shown in the version in the
"Solution" (which
<span class="docEmphasis">is</span> intended for
"production" use in Python 2.3).</p>

<p class="docText">Once you've called <tt>tee</tt> on an
iterator, you should no longer use the original iterator anywhere
else; otherwise, the iterator could advance without the knowledge of
the <tt>tee</tt>-generated objects, and those objects would
then "get out of sync" with the
original. Be warned that <I>tee</I> requires auxiliary
storage that is proportional to how much the two
<i>tee</i>-generated objects get
"apart" from each other in their
separate iterations. In general, if one iterator is going to walk
over most or all of the data from the original before the
"other" one starts advancing, you
should consider using <tt>list</tt> instead of
<i>tee</i>. Both of these caveats apply to the
<tt>itertools.tee</tt> function of Python 2.4 just as well
as they apply to the pure Python versions of <I>tee</i>
presented in this recipe. One more caveat: again both for the
versions in this recipe, and the <tt>itertools.tee</tt>
function in Python 2.4, there is no guarantee of thread safety: to
access the tee'd iterators from different threads,
you need to guard those iterators with a single lock!</p>
