<h3 class="docSection1Title">Recipe 2.2. Writing to a File</h3>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Credit: Luther Blissett</span></p>

<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-2-SECT-2.1"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-2-ITERM-1617"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-2-ITERM-1618"></a>You want to write text or data to a
file.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-2-SECT-2.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">Here is the most convenient way to write one long string to a file:</p>

<pre>open('thefile.txt', 'w').write(all_the_text)  # text to a text file
open('abinfile', 'wb').write(all_the_data)    # data to a binary file</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">However, it is safer to bind the file object to a name, so that you
can call <tt>close</tt> on the file object as soon as
you're done. For example, for a text file:</p>

<pre>file_object = open('thefile.txt', 'w')
file_object.write(all_the_text)
file_object.close( )</pre><BR>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-2-ITERM-1619"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-2-ITERM-1620"></a>Often, the data you want to write is not
in one big string, but in a list (or other sequence) of strings. In
this case, you should use the <tt>writelines</tt> method
(which, despite its name, is not limited to lines and works just as
well with binary data as with text
files!):<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-2-ITERM-1621"></a></P>

<pre>file_object.writelines(list_of_text_strings)
open('abinfile', 'wb').writelines(list_of_data_strings)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Calling <tt>writelines</tt> is much faster than the
alternatives of joining the strings into one big string (e.g., with
'<tt>'.join</tt>) and then calling
<tt>write</tt>, or calling <tt>write</tt>
repeatedly in a loop.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-2-SECT-2.3"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">To create a file object for writing, you must always pass a second
argument to <tt>open</tt> (or
<tt>file</tt>)either '<tt>w</tt>' to write
textual data or '<tt>wb</tt>' to write binary data. The
same considerations detailed previously in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-2-SECT-1.html#pythoncook2-CHP-2-SECT-1">Recipe 2.1</a> apply here, except that
calling <tt>close</tt> explicitly is even more advisable
when you're writing to a file rather than reading
from it. Only by closing the file can you be reasonably sure that the
data is actually on the disk and not still residing in some temporary
buffer in memory.</p>

<p class="docText">Writing a file a little at a time is even more common than reading a
file a little at a time. You can just call <tt>write</tt>
and/or <tt>writelines</tt> repeatedly, as each string or
sequence of strings to write becomes ready. Each write operation
appends data at the end of the file, after all the previously written
data. When you're done, call the
<tt>close</tt> method on the file object. If all the data
is available at once, a single <tt>writelines</tt> call is
faster and simpler. However, if the data becomes available a little
at a time, it's better to call
<tt>write</tt> as the data comes, than to build up a
temporary list of pieces (e.g., with <tt>append</tt>) just
in order to be able to write it all at once in the end with
<tt>writelines</tt>. Reading and writing are quite
different, with respect to the performance and convenience
implications of operating "in bulk"
versus operating a little at a time.</p>

<p class="docText">When you open a file for writing with option '<tt>w</tt>'
(or '<tt>wb</tt>'), any data that might already have been
in the file is immediately destroyed; even if you close the file
object immediately after opening it, you still end up with an empty
file on the disk. If you want the data you're
writing to be appended to the previous contents of the file, open the
file with option '<tt>a</tt>' (or '<tt>ab</tt>')
instead. More advanced options allow both reading and writing on the
same open file objectin particular, see <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-2-SECT-8.html#pythoncook2-CHP-2-SECT-8">Recipe 2.8</a> for option
'<tt>r+b</tt>', which, in practice, is the only frequently
used one out of all the advanced option strings.</p>
