<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You need to multiply inherit from several classes that may come from
several metaclasses, so you need to generate automatically a custom
metaclass to solve any possible metaclass conflicts.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-20-SECT-17.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">First of all, given a sequence of metaclasses, we want to filter out
"redundant" onesthose that
are already implied by others, being duplicates or superclasses. This
job nicely factors into a general-purpose generator yielding the
unique, nonredundant items of an iterable, and a function using
<tt>inspect.getmro</tt> to make the set of all superclasses
of the given classes (since superclasses are redundant):</p>

<pre># support 2.3, too
try: set
except NameError: from sets import Set as set
# support classic classes, to some extent
import types
def uniques(sequence, skipset):
    for item in sequence:
        if item not in skipset:
            yield item
            skipset.add(item)
import inspect
def remove_redundant(classes):
    redundant = set([types.ClassType])   # turn old-style classes to new
    for c in classes:
        redundant.update(inspect.getmro(c)[1:])
    return tuple(uniques(classes, redundant))</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Using the <tt>remove_redundant</tt> function, we can
generate a metaclass that can resolve metatype conflicts (given a
sequence of base classes, and other metaclasses to inject both before
and after those implied by the base classes). It's
important to avoid generating more than one metaclass to solve the
same potential conflicts, so we also keep a
"memoization" mapping:</p>

<pre>memoized_metaclasses_map = {  }
def _get_noconflict_metaclass(bases, left_metas, right_metas):
     # make tuple of needed metaclasses in specified order
     metas = left_metas + tuple(map(type, bases)) + right_metas
     needed_metas = remove_redundant(metas)
     # return existing confict-solving meta, if any
     try: return memoized_metaclasses_map[needed_metas]
     except KeyError: pass
     # compute, memoize and return needed conflict-solving meta
     if not needed_metas:         # whee, a trivial case, happy us
         meta = type
     elif len(needed_metas) == 1: # another trivial case
         meta = needed_metas[0]
     else:                        # nontrivial, darn, gotta work...
         # ward against non-type root metatypes
         for m in needed_metas:
             if not issubclass(m, type):
                 raise TypeError( 'Non-type root metatype %r' % m)
         metaname = '_' + ''.join([m._ _name_ _ for m in needed_metas])
         meta = classmaker( )(metaname, needed_metas, {  })
     memoized_metaclasses_map[needed_metas] = meta
     return meta
def classmaker(left_metas=( ), right_metas=( )):
     def make_class(name, bases, adict):
         metaclass = _get_noconflict_metaclass(bases, left_metas, right_metas)
         return metaclass(name, bases, adict)
     return make_class</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">The internal <I>_get_noconflict_metaclass</i> function,
which returns (and, if needed, builds) the conflict-resolution
metaclass, and the public <I>classmaker</I> closure must be
mutually recursive for a rather subtle reason. If
<i>_get_noconflict_metaclass</i> just built the metaclass
with the reasonably common idiom:</p>

<pre>         meta = type(metaname, needed_metas, {  })</pre><br>


<p class="docText">it would work in all ordinary cases, but it might get into trouble
when the metaclasses involved have custom metaclasses themselves!
Just like "little fleas have lesser
fleas," so, potentially, metaclasses can have
meta-metaclasses, and so onfortunately
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> "ad
infinitum," pace Augustus De Morgan, so the mutual
recursion does eventually terminate.</P>

<p class="docText">The recipe offers minimal support for old-style (i.e., classic)
classes, with the simple expedient of initializing the set
<i>redundant</i> to contain the metaclass of old-style
classes, <tt>types.ClassType</tt>. In practice, this recipe
imposes automatic conversion to new-style classes. Trying to offer
more support than this for classic classes, which are after all a
mere legacy feature, would be overkill, given the confused and
confusing situation of metaclass use for old-style classes.</P>

<p class="docText">In all of our code outside of this <i>noconflict.py</I>
module, we will only use <i>noconflict.classmaker</I>,
optionally passing it metaclasses we want to inject, left and right,
to obtain a callable that we can then use just like a metaclass to
build new class objects given names, bases, and dictionary, but with
the assurance that metatype conflicts cannot occur. Phew. Now
<span class="docEmphasis">that</span> was worth it, wasn't it?!</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-20-SECT-17.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">Here is the simplest case in which a metatype conflict can occur:
multiply inheriting from two classes with independent metaclasses. In
a pedagogically simplified toy-level example, that could be, say:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Meta_A(type): pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Meta_B(type): pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; class A: _ _metaclass_ _ = Meta_A
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; class B: _ _metaclass_ _ = Meta_B
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(A, B): pass
<b>Traceback (most recent call last):</b>
<b>  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?</b>
<b>TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases</b>
<b>    metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a</b>
<b>(non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre><br>


<p class="docText">A class normally inherits its metaclass from its bases, but when the
bases have distinct metaclasses, the metatype constraint that Python
expresses so tersely in this error message applies. So, we need to
build a new metaclass, say <tt><i>Meta_C</i></tt>, which
inherits from both <tt><i>Meta_A</i></tt> and
<tt><I>Meta_B</I></tt>. For a demonstration of this need,
see the book that's so aptly considered the bible of
metaclasses: Ira R. Forman and Scott H. Danforth, <span class="docEmphasis">Putting
Metaclasses to Work: A New Dimension in Object-Oriented
Programming</span> (Addison-Wesley).</p>

<p class="docText">Python does not do magic: it does not automatically create the
required <tt><i>Meta_C</I></tt>. Rather, Python raises a
<tt>TypeError</tt> to ensure that the programmer is aware
of the problem. In simple cases, the programmer can solve the
metatype conflict by hand, as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Meta_C(Meta_A, Meta_B): pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(A, B): _ _metaclass_ _ = Meta_C</pre><br>


<p class="docText">In this case, everything works smoothly.</p>

<p class="docText">The key point of this recipe is to show an automatic way to resolve
metatype conflicts, rather than having to do it by hand every time.
Having saved all the code from this recipe's
Solution into <i>noconflict.py</i> somewhere along your
Python <tt>sys.path</tt>, you can make class
<i>C</I> with automatic conflict resolution, as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import noconflict
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(A, B): _ _metaclass_ _ = noconflict.classmaker( )</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">The call to the <i>noconflict.classmaker</I> closure
returns a function that, when Python calls it, obtains the proper
metaclass and uses it to build the class object. It cannot yet return
the metaclass itself, but that's OKyou
<span class="docEmphasis">can</span> assign anything you want to the <tt>_
_metaclass_ _</tt> attribute of your class, as long as
it's callable with the (name, bases, dict) arguments
and nicely builds the class object. Once again,
Python's signature-based polymorphism serves us well
and unobtrusively.</p>

<p class="docText">Automating the resolution of the metatype conflict has many pluses,
even in simple cases. Thanks to the
"memoizing" technique used in
<I>noconflict.py</I>, the same conflict-resolving
metaclass is used for any occurrence of a given sequence of
conflicting metaclasses. Moreover, with this approach you may also
explicitly inject other metaclasses, beyond those you get from your
base classes, and again you can avoid conflicts. Consider:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class D(A): _ _metaclass_ _ = Meta_B
<B>Traceback (most recent call last):</b>
<B>  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?</b>
<b>TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases</b>
<b>    metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a</b>
<b>(non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">This metatype conflict is resolved just as easily as the former one:</P>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class D(A): _ _metaclass_ _ = noconflict.classmaker((Meta_B,))</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The code presented in this recipe's Solution takes
pains to avoid any subclassing that is not strictly necessary, and it
also uses mutual recursion to avoid any meta-level of meta-meta-type
conflicts. You might never meet higher-order-meta conflicts anyway,
but if you adopt the code presented in this recipe, you need not even
worry about them.</p>

<p class="docText">Thanks to David Mertz for help in polishing the original version of
the code. This version has benefited immensely from discussions with
Phillip J. Eby. Alex Martelli and Anna Martelli Ravenscroft did their
best to make the recipe's code and discussion as
explicit and understandable as they could. The functionality in this
recipe is not absolutely complete: for example, it supports old-style
classes only in a rather backhanded way, and it does not really cover
such exotica as nontype metatype roots (such as Zope
2's old <tt>ExtensionClass</tt>). These
limitations are there primarily to keep this recipe as understandable
as possible. You may find a more complete implementation of metatype
conflict resolution at Phillip J. Eby's PEAK site,
<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/">http://peak.telecommunity.com/</a>,
in the <tt>peak.util.Meta</tt> module of the PEAK
framework.</P>
