<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You need to add functionality to an existing class, without changing
the source code for that class, and inheritance is not applicable
(since it would make a new class, rather than changing the existing
one). Specifically, you need to enrich a method of the class, adding
some extra functionality "around"
that of the existing method.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-20-SECT-6.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">Adding completely new methods (and other attributes) to an existing
<tt>class</tt> object is quite simple, since the built-in
function <tt>setattr</tt> does essentially all the work. We
need to "decorate" an existing
method to add to its functionality. To achieve this, we can build the
new replacement method as a closure. The best architecture is to
define general-purpose wrapper and unwrapper functions, such as:</p>

<pre>import inspect
def wrapfunc(obj, name, processor, avoid_doublewrap=True):
    """ patch obj.&lt;name&gt; so that calling it actually calls, instead,
            processor(original_callable, *args, **kwargs)
    """
    # get the callable at obj.&lt;name&gt;
    call = getattr(obj, name)
    # optionally avoid multiple identical wrappings
    if avoid_doublewrap and getattr(call, 'processor', None) is processor:
        return
    # get underlying function (if any), and anyway def the wrapper closure
    original_callable = getattr(call, 'im_func', call)
    def wrappedfunc(*args, **kwargs):
        return processor(original_callable, *args, **kwargs)
    # set attributes, for future unwrapping and to avoid double-wrapping
    wrappedfunc.original = call
    wrappedfunc.processor = processor
    # 2.4 only: wrappedfunc._ _name_ _ = getattr(call, '_ _name_ _', name)
    # rewrap staticmethod and classmethod specifically (iff obj is a class)
    if inspect.isclass(obj):
        if hasattr(call, 'im_self'):
            if call.im_self:
                wrappedfunc = classmethod(wrappedfunc)
        else:
            wrappedfunc = staticmethod(wrappedfunc)
    # finally, install the wrapper closure as requested
    setattr(obj, name, wrappedfunc)
def unwrapfunc(obj, name):
    ''' undo the effects of wrapfunc(obj, name, processor) '''
    setattr(obj, name, getattr(obj, name).original)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">This approach to wrapping is carefully coded to work just as well on
ordinary functions (when <i>obj</I> is a module) as on
methods of all kinds (e.g., bound methods, when <I>obj</i>
is an instance; unbound, class, and static methods, when
<I>obj</I> is a class). This method
doesn't work when <i>obj</i> is a built-in
type, though, because built-ins are immutable.</p>

<p class="docText">For example, suppose we want to have
"tracing" prints of all that
happens whenever a particular method is called. Using the
general-purpose <i>wrapfunc</I> function just shown, we
could code:</p>

<pre>def tracing_processor(original_callable, *args, **kwargs):
    r_name = getattr(original_callable, '_ _name_ _', '&lt;unknown&gt;')
    r_args = map(repr, args)
    r_args.extend(['%s=%r' % x for x in kwargs.iteritems( )])
    print "begin call to %s(%s)" % (r_name, ", ".join(r_args))
    try:
        result = call(*args, **kwargs)
    except:
        print "EXCEPTION in call to %s" %(r_name,)
        raise
    else:
        print "call to %s result: %r" %(r_name, result)
        return result
def add_tracing_prints_to_method(class_object, method_name):
    wrapfunc(class_object, method_name, tracing_processor)</pre><br>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">This recipe's task occurs fairly often when
you're trying to modify the behavior of a standard
or third-party Python module, since editing the source of the module
itself is undesirable. In particular, this recipe can be handy for
debugging, since the example function
<I>add_tracing_prints_to_method</i> presented in the
"Solution" lets you see on standard
output all details of calls to a method you want to watch, without
modifying the library module, and without requiring interactive
access to the Python session in which the calls occur.</P>

<p class="docText">You can also use this recipe's approach on a larger
scale. For example, say that a library that you imported has a long
series of methods that return numeric error codes. You could wrap
each of them inside an enhanced wrapper method, which raises an
exception when the error code from the original method indicates an
error condition. Again, a key issue is not having to modify the
library's own code. However, methodical application
of wrappers when building a subclass is also a way to avoid
repetitious code (i.e., boilerplate). For example, <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-12.html#pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-12">Recipe 5.12</a> and <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-24.html#pythoncook2-CHP-1-SECT-24">Recipe 1.24</a> might be recoded to take
advantage of the general <I>wrapfunc</i> presented in this
recipe.</p>

<p class="docText">Particularly when "wrapping on a large
scale", it is important to be able to
"unwrap" methods back to their
normal state, which is why this recipe's Solution
also includes an <i>unwrapfunc</i> function. It may also be
handy to avoid accidentally wrapping the same method in the same way
twice, which is why <i>wrapfunc</i> supports the optional
parameter <i>avoid_doublewrap</i>, defaulting to
<tt>true</tt>, to avoid such double wrapping.
(Unfortunately, <tt>classmethod</tt> and
<tt>staticmethod</tt> do not support per-instance
attributes, so the avoidance of double wrapping, as well as the
ability to "unwrap", cannot be
guaranteed in all cases.)</p>

<p class="docText">You can wrap the same method multiple times with different
processors. However, unwrapping must proceed last-in, first-out; as
coded, this recipe does not support the ability to remove a wrapper
from "somewhere in the middle" of a
chain of several wrappers. A related limitation of this recipe as
coded is that double wrapping is not detected when another unrelated
wrapping occurred in the meantime. (We don't even
try to detect what we might call "deep double
wrapping.")</p>

<p class="docText">If you need "generalized
unwrapping", you can extend
<i>unwrap_func</i> to return the processor it has removed;
then you can obtain generalized unwrapping by unwrapping all the way,
recording a list of the processors that you removed, and then pruning
that list of processors and rewrapping. Similarly, generalized
detection of "deep" double wrapping
could be implemented based on this same idea.</P>

<p class="docText">Another generalization, to fully support
<tt>staticmethod</tt> and <tt>classmethod</tt>,
is to use a global <tt>dict</tt>, rather than per-instance
attributes, for the <I>original</i> and
<i>processor</I> values; functions, bound and unbound
methods, as well as class methods and static methods, can all be used
as keys into such a dictionary. Doing so obviates the issue with the
inability to set per-instance attributes on class methods and static
methods. However, each of these generalizations can be somewhat
complicated, so we are not pursuing them further here.</p>

<p class="docText">Once you have coded some processors with the signature and semantics
required by this recipe's <i>wrapfunc</i>,
you can also use such processors more directly (in cases where
modifying the source is OK) with a Python 2.4 decorator, as follows:</p>

<pre>def processedby(processor):
    """ decorator to wrap the processor around a function. """
    def processedfunc(func):
        def wrappedfunc(*args, **kwargs):
            return processor(func, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrappedfunc
    return processedfunc</pre><br>


<p class="docText">For example, to wrap this recipe's
<i>tracing_processor</I> around a certain method at the
time the <tt>class</tt> statement executes, in Python 2.4,
you can code:</p>

<pre>class SomeClass(object):
    @processedby(tracing_processor)
    def amethod(self, s):
        return 'Hello, ' + s</pre><BR>
