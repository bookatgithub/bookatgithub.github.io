<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">This recipe implements the same functionality as in the previous
<a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-3-SECT-10.html#pythoncook2-CHP-3-SECT-10">Recipe 3.10</a>, but instead of
that recipe's simpler roll-our-own approach, this
one uses the standard library module <tt>sched</tt>.</P>

<p class="docText"><tt>sched</tt> is a reasonably simple, yet flexible and
powerful, module for scheduling tasks that must take place at given
times in the future. To use <tt>sched</tt>, you first
instantiate a <tt>scheduler</tt> object, such as
<i>schedule</I> (shown in this recipe's
Solution), with two arguments. The first argument is the function to
call in order to find out what time it isnormally
<tt>time.time</tt>, which returns the current time as a
number of seconds from an arbitrary reference point known as the
<I>epoch</i>. The second argument is the function to
call to wait for some timenormally
<tt>time.sleep</tt>. You can also pass functions that
measure time in arbitrary artificial ways. For example, you can use
<tt>sched</tt> for such tasks as simulation programs.
However, measuring time in artificial ways is an advanced use of
<tt>sched</tt> not covered in this recipe.</p>

<p class="docText">Once you have a <tt>sched.scheduler</tt> instance
<tt><i>s</i></tt>, you schedule events by calling either
<tt>s.enter</tt>, to schedule something at a relative time
<tt><I>n</i></tt> seconds from now (you can pass
<tt><i>n</I></tt> as 0 to schedule something for
<span class="docEmphasis">right now</span>), or
<tt><i>s</I></tt><tt>.enterabs</tt>, to schedule
something at a given absolute time. In either case, you pass the time
(relative or absolute), a priority (if multiple events are scheduled
for the same time, they execute in priority order, lowest-priority
first), a function to call, and a tuple of arguments to call that
function with. Each of these two methods return an <i>event
identifier</I>, an arbitrary token that you may store
somewhere and later use to cancel a scheduled event by passing the
event's token as the argument in a call to
<tt><I>s</i></tt><tt>.cancel</tt>another
advanced use which this recipe does not cover.</p>

<p class="docText">After scheduling some events, you call
<tt><i>s</i></tt><tt>.run</tt>, which keeps
running until the queue of scheduled events is empty. In this recipe,
we show how to schedule a periodic, recurring event: function
<i>perform_command</i> reschedules itself for
<i>inc</i> seconds later in the future as the first thing
it does, before running the specified system command. In this way,
the queue of scheduled events never empties, and function
<i>perform_command</i> keeps getting called with regular
periodicity. This self-rescheduling is an important idiom, not just
in using <tt>sched</tt>, but any time you have a
"one-shot" way to ask for something
to happen in the future, and you need instead to have something
happen in the future
"periodically".
(Tkinter's <tt>after</tt> method, e.g.,
also works in exactly this way, and thus is also often used with just
this kind of self-rescheduling idiom.)</p>

<p class="docText">Even for a task as simple as the one handled by this recipe,
<tt>sched</tt> still has a small advantage over the simpler
roll-your-own approach used previously in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-3-SECT-10.html#pythoncook2-CHP-3-SECT-10">Recipe 3.10</a>. In <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-3-SECT-10.html#pythoncook2-CHP-3-SECT-10">Recipe 3.10</a>, the specified delay occurs between the
<span class="docEmphasis">end</span> of one execution of <i>cmd</i> and
the <span class="docEmphasis">beginning</span> of the next execution. If the
execution of <I>cmd</I> takes a highly variable amount of
time (as is often the case, e.g., for commands that must wait for the
network, or some busy server, etc.), then the command is not really
being run periodically. In this recipe, the delay occurs between
<span class="docEmphasis">beginning</span> successive runs of
<i>cmd</i>, so that periodicity is indeed guaranteed. If a
certain run of <I>cmd</i> takes longer than
<i>inc</i> seconds, the schedule temporarily falls behind,
but it will eventually catch up again, as long as the
<span class="docEmphasis">average</span> running time of <i>cmd</i> is
less than <i>inc</I> seconds: <tt>sched</tt>
never "skips" events. (If you
<span class="docEmphasis">do</span> want an event to be skipped because
it's not relevant any more, you have to keep track
of the event identifier token and use the <tt>cancel</tt>
method.)</p>
