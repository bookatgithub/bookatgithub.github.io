<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1794"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1795"></a>You
want to copy an object. However, when you assign an object, pass it
as an argument, or return it as a result, Python uses a reference to
the original object, without making a copy.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-1.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1796"></a>Module
<tt>copy</tt> in the standard Python library offers two
functions to create copies. The one you should generally use is the
function named <tt>copy</tt>, which returns a new object
containing exactly the same items and attributes as the object
you're copying:</p>

<pre>import copy
new_list = copy.copy(existing_list)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">On the rare occasions when you also want every item and attribute in
the object to be separately copied, recursively, use
<tt>deepcopy</tt>:</p>

<pre>import copy
new_list_of_dicts = copy.deepcopy(existing_list_of_dicts)</pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-1.3"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">When you assign an object (or pass it as an argument, or return it as
a result), Python (like Java) uses a reference to the original
object, not a copy. Some other programming languages make copies
every time you assign something. Python never makes copies
"implicitly" just because
you're assigning: to get a copy, you must
specifically <span class="docEmphasis">request</span> a copy.</P>

<p class="docText">Python's behavior is simple, fast, and uniform.
However, if you do need a copy and do not ask for one, you may have
problems. For example:</P>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.append(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a, b
<b>[1, 2, 3, 5] [1, 2, 3, 5]</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">Here, the names <tt><i>a</i></tt> and
<tt><I>b</i></tt> both refer to the same object (a list),
so once we alter the object through one of these names, we later see
the altered object no matter which name we use for it. No original,
unaltered copy is left lying about anywhere.</p>
<P><table border="0" bgcolor="black" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="90%" align="center"><tr><TD><table bgcolor="white" width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"><tr><TD width="60" valign="top"><img src="images/warning_yellow.gif" width="51" height="36" alt=""></TD><td valign="top">


<p class="docText">To become an effective Python programmer, it is crucial that you
learn to draw the distinction between <span class="docEmphasis">altering an
object</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">assigning to a name</span>, which
previously happened to refer to the object. These two kinds of
operations have nothing to do with each other. A statement such as
<tt>a=[ ]</tt> rebinds name <tt><i>a</i></tt>
but performs no alteration at all on the object that was previously
bound to name <tt><i>a</i></tt>. Therefore, the issue of
references versus copies just doesn't arise in this
case: the issue is meaningful only when you
<span class="docEmphasis">alter</span> some object.</p>
</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></p><br>

<p class="docText">If you are about to alter an object, but you want to keep the
original object unaltered, you must make a copy. As this
recipe's solution explains, the module
<tt>copy</tt> from the Python Standard Library offers two
functions to make copies. Normally, you use
<tt>copy.copy</tt>, which makes a <i>shallow
copy</I>it copies an object, but for each attribute or
item of the object, it continues to share references, which is faster
and saves memory.</P>

<p class="docText">Shallow copying, alas, isn't sufficient to entirely
"decouple" a copied object from the
original one, if you propose to alter the items or attributes of
either object, not just the object itself:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; list_of_lists = [ ['a'], [1, 2], ['z', 23] ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; copy_lol = copy.copy(lists_of_lists)
&gt;&gt;&gt; copy_lol[1].append('boo')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print list_of_lists, copy_lol
<b>[['a'], [1, 2, 'boo'], ['z', 23]] [['a'], [1, 2, 'boo'], ['z', 23]]</b></pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Here, the names <tt>list_of_lists</tt> and
<tt>copy_lol</tt> refer to distinct objects (two lists), so
we could alter either of them without affecting the other. However,
each <span class="docEmphasis">item</span> of <tt>list_of_lists</tt> is
the same object as the corresponding item of
<tt>copy_lol</tt>, so once we alter an item reached by
indexing either of these names, we later see the altered item no
matter which object we're indexing to reach it.</p>

<p class="docText">If you do need to copy some container object <span class="docEmphasis">and</span>
also recursively copy all objects it refers to (meaning all items,
all attributes, and also items of items, items of attributes, etc.),
use <tt>copy.deepcopy</tt>such deep copying may cost
you substantial amounts of time and memory, but if you gotta, you
gotta. For deep copies, <tt>copy.deepcopy</tt> is the only
way to go.</p>

<p class="docText">For normal shallow copies, you may have good alternatives to
<tt>copy.copy</tt>, if you know the type of the object you
want to copy. To copy a list <tt><i>L</i></tt>, call
<tt>list(</tt><tt><i>L</i></tt><tt>)</tt>;
to copy a dict <tt>d</tt>, call <tt>dict(d)</tt>;
to copy a set <tt><I>s</i></tt> (in Python 2.4, which
introduces the built-in type <tt>set</tt>), call
<tt>set(s)</tt>. (Since <tt>list</tt>,
<tt>dict</tt>, and, in 2.4, <tt>set</tt>, are
built-in names, you do not need to perform any
"preparation" before you use any of
them.) You get the general pattern: to copy a copyable object
<tt><I>o,</i></tt> which belongs to some built-in Python
type <tt><I>t</i></tt>, you may generally just call
<tt>t(o)</tt>. <tt>dict</tt>s also offer a
dedicated method to perform a shallow copy: <tt>d.copy(
)</tt> and <tt>dict(d)</tt> do the same thing. Of the
two, I suggest you use <tt>dict(d)</tt>:
it's more uniform with respect to other types, and
it's even shorter by one character!</P>

<p class="docText">To copy instances of arbitrary types or classes, whether you coded
them or got them from a library, just use
<tt>copy.copy</tt>. If you code your own classes,
it's generally not worth the bother to define your
own <I>copy</i> or <I>clone</I> method. If you
want to customize the way instances of your class get (shallowly)
copied, your class can supply a special method <tt>_ _copy_
_</tt> (see <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-6-SECT-9.html#pythoncook2-CHP-6-SECT-9">Recipe 6.9</a> for a special technique
relating to the implementation of such a method), or special methods
<tt>_ _getstate_ _</tt> and <tt>_ _setstate_
_</tt>. (See <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-7-SECT-4.html#pythoncook2-CHP-7-SECT-4">Recipe 7.4</a> for notes on these special
methods, which also help with deep copying and
serializationi.e., <i>pickling</i>of
instances of your class.) If you want to customize the way instances
of your class get <span class="docEmphasis">deeply</span> copied, your class can
supply a special method <tt>_ _deepcopy_ _</tt> (see <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-6-SECT-9.html#pythoncook2-CHP-6-SECT-9">Recipe 6.9</a>.)</p>

<p class="docText">Note that you do not need to copy immutable objects (strings,
numbers, tuples, etc.) because you don't have to
worry about altering them. If you do try to perform such a copy,
you'll just get the original right back; no harm
done, but it's a waste of time and code. For
example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'cat'
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = copy.copy(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s is t
<B>True</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">The <tt>is</tt> operator checks whether two objects are not
merely equal, but in fact the <span class="docEmphasis">same</span> object
(<tt>is</tt> checks for <span class="docEmphasis">identity</span>; for
checking mere <span class="docEmphasis">equality</span>, you use the
<tt>==</tt> operator). Checking object identity is not
particularly useful for immutable objects (we're
using it here just to show that the call to
<tt>copy.copy</tt> was useless, although innocuous).
However, checking object identity can sometimes be quite important
for mutable objects. For example, if you're not sure
whether two names <tt><i>a</I></tt> and
<tt><i>b</I></tt> refer to separate objects, or whether
both refer to the same object, a simple and very fast check
<tt>a is b</tt> lets you know how things stand. That way
you know whether you need to copy the object before altering it, in
case you want to keep the original object unaltered.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1797"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1798"></a></p>

<p class="docText">You can use other, inferior ways exist to create copies, namely
building your own. Given a list <tt><i>L</i></tt>, both a
"whole-object slice"
<tt>L[:]</tt> and a list comprehension <tt>[x for x in
L]</tt> do happen to make a (shallow) copy of
<tt><i>L</i></tt>, as do adding an empty list,
<tt>L+[ ]</tt>, and multiplying the list by 1, <tt>L*1</tt>
. . . but each of these constructs is just wasted effort
and obfuscationcalling <tt>list(L)</tt> is clearer
and faster. You should, however, be familiar with the
<tt>L[:]</tt> construct because for historical reasons
it's widely used. So, even though
you're best advised not to use it yourself,
you'll see it in Python code written by others.</p>
