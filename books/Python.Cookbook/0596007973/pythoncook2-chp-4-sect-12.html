<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You want to build a dict from a list of alternating keys and values.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-12.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">The built-in type <tt>dict</tt> offers many ways to build
dictionaries, but not this one, so we need to code a function for the
purpose. One way is to use the built-in function
<tt>zip</tt> on extended slices:</p>

<pre>def dictFromList(keysAndValues):
    return dict(zip(keysAndValues[::2], keysAndValues[1::2]))</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">A more general approach, which works for any sequence or other
iterable argument and not just for lists, is to
"factor out" the task of getting a
sequence of pairs from a flat sequence into a separate generator.
This approach is not quite as concise as
<i>dictFromList</I>, but it's faster as
well as more general:</P>

<pre>def pairwise(iterable):
    itnext = iter(iterable).next
    while True:
        yield itnext( ), itnext( )
def dictFromSequence(seq):
    return dict(pairwise(seq))</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Defining <I>pairwise</I> also allows
<span class="docEmphasis">updating</span> an existing dictionary with any
sequence of alternating keys and valuesjust code, for example,
<tt>mydict.update(pairwise(seq))</tt>.</p>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-12.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">Both of the "factory functions" in
this recipe use the same underlying way to construct a dictionary:
each calls <tt>dict</tt> with an argument that is a
sequence of <tt>(key, value)</tt> pairs. All the difference
is in how the functions build the sequence of pairs to pass to
<tt>dict</tt>.</p>

<p class="docText"><I>dictFromList</i> builds a list of such pairs by calling
built-in function <tt>zip</tt> with two extended-form
slices of the function's
<i>keysAndValues</I> argumentone that gathers all
items with even indices (meaning the items at index 0, 2, 4, . . .),
the other that gathers all items with odd indices (starting at 1 and
counting by 2 . . .). This approach is fine, but it works only when
the argument named <i>keysAndValues</I> is an instance of a
type or class that supports extended slicing, such as
<tt>list</tt>, <tt>tuple</tt> or
<tt>str</tt>. Also, this approach results in constructing
several temporary lists in memory: if <i>keysAndValues</I>
is a long sequence, all of this list construction activity can cost
some performance.</P>

<p class="docText"><i>dictFromSequence</i>, on the other hand, delegates the
task of building the sequence of pairs to the generator named
<i>pairwise</i>. In turn, <i>pairwise</i> is
coded to ensure that it can use any iterable at allnot just
lists (or other sequences, such as tuples or strings), but also, for
example, results of other generators, files, dictionaries, and so on.
Moreover, <i>pairwise</i> yields pairs one at a time. It
never constructs any long list in memory, an aspect that may improve
performance if the input sequence is very long.</p>

<p class="docText">The implementation of <i>pairwise</i> is interesting. As
its very first statement, <i>pairwise</i> binds local name
<tt>itnext</tt> to the bound-method <tt>next</tt>
of the iterator that it obtains by calling the built-in function
<tt>iter</tt> on the <I>iterable</I> argument.
This may seem a bit strange, but it's a good general
technique in Python: if you start with an object, and all you need to
do with that object is call one of its methods in a loop, you can
extract the bound-method, assign it to a local name, and afterwards
just call the local name as if it were a function.
<i>pairwise</i> would work just as well if the
<tt>next</tt> method was instead called in a way that may
look more normal to programmers who are used to other languages:</P>

<pre>def pairwise_slow(iterable):
    it = iter(iterable)
    while True:
        yield it.next( ), it.next( )</pre><br>


<p class="docText">However, this <i>pairwise_slow</i> variant
isn't really any simpler than the
<i>pairwise</i> generator shown in the Solution
("more familiar to people who don't
know Python" is <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> a synonym
of "simpler"!), and it
<span class="docEmphasis">is</span> about 60% slower. Focusing on simplicity and
clarity is one thing, and a very good oneindeed, a core
principle of Python. Throwing performance to the winds,
<span class="docEmphasis">without</span> getting any real advantage to
compensate, is a completely different proposition and definitely not
a practice that can be recommended in any language. So, while it is
an excellent idea to focus on writing correct, clear, and simple
code, it's also very advisable to learn and use
Python's idioms that are most appropriate to your
needs.</p>
