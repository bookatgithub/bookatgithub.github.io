<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1862"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1863"></a>Given two dictionaries, you
need to find the set of keys that are in <span class="docEmphasis">both</span>
dictionaries (the intersection) or the set of keys that are in
<span class="docEmphasis">either</span> dictionary (the union).</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-17.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">Sometimes, particularly in Python 2.3, you find yourself using
dictionaries as concrete representations of sets. In such cases, you
only care about the keys, not the corresponding values, and often you
build the dictionaries by calls to <tt>dict.fromkeys</tt>,
such as<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1864"></a></p>

<pre>a = dict.fromkeys(xrange(1000))
b = dict.fromkeys(xrange(500, 1500))</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">The fastest way to compute the <tt>dict</tt> that is the
set-union is:</p>

<pre>union = dict(a, **b)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">The fastest concise way to compute the <tt>dict</tt> that
is the set-intersection is:</P>

<pre>inter = dict.fromkeys([x for x in a if x in b])</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1865"></a>If the number of items in
dictionaries <tt><I>a</I></tt> and
<tt><i>b</i></tt> can be very different, then it can be
important for speed considerations to have the shorter one in the
<tt>for</tt> clause, and the longer one in the
<tt>if</tt> clause, of this list comprehension. In such
cases, it may be worth sacrificing some conciseness in favor of
speed, by coding the intersection computation as follows:</p>

<pre>if len(a) &lt; len(b):
    inter = dict.fromkeys([x for x in a if x not in b])
else:
    inter = dict.fromkeys([x for x in b if x not in a])</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1866"></a>Python also gives
you types to represent sets directly (in standard library module
<tt>sets</tt>, and, in Python 2.4, also as built-ins). Here
is a snippet that you can use at the start of a module: the snippet
ensures that name <tt>set</tt> is bound to the best
available set type, so that throughout the module, you can then use
the same code whether you're using Python 2.3 or
2.4:</P>

<pre>try:
    set
except NameError:
    from sets import Set as set</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Having done this, you can now use type <tt>set</tt> to best
effect, gaining clarity and conciseness, and (in Python 2.4) gaining
a little speed, too:</p>

<pre>a = set(xrange(1000))
b = set(xrange(500, 1500))
union = a | b
inter = a &amp; b</pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-17.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1867"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1868"></a>In Python 2.3,
even though the Python Standard Library module
<tt>sets</tt> offers an elegant data type
<tt>Set</tt> that directly represents a set (with hashable
elements), it is still common to use a <tt>dict</tt> to
represent a set, partly for historical reasons. Just in case you want
to keep doing it, this recipe shows you how to compute unions and
intersections of such sets in the fastest ways, which are not
obvious. The code in this recipe, on my machine, takes about 260
microseconds for the union, about 690 for the intersection (with
Python 2.3; with Python 2.4, 260 and 600,respectively), while
alternatives based on loops or generator expressions are
substantially slower.</p>

<p class="docText">However, it's best to use type
<tt>set</tt> instead of representing sets by dictionaries.
As the recipe shows, using <tt>set</tt> makes your code
more direct and readable. If you dislike the or-operator
(<tt>|)</tt> and the
"and-operator"
(<tt>&amp;)</tt>, you can equivalently use
<tt>a.union(b)</tt> and
<tt>a.intersection(b)</tt>, respectively. Besides clarity,
you also gain speed, particularly in Python 2.4: computing the union
still takes about 260 microseconds, but computing the intersection
takes only about 210. Even in Python 2.3, this approach is acceptably
fast: computing the union takes about 270 microseconds, computing the
intersection takes about 650not quite as fast as Python 2.4
but still quite comparable to what you can get if you represent sets
by dictionaries. Last but not least, once you use type
<tt>set</tt> (whether it is the Python 2.4 built-in, or
class <tt>Set</tt> from the Python Standard Library module
<tt>sets</tt>, the interface is the same), you gain a
wealth of useful set operations. For example, the set of elements
that are in either <tt><I>a</I></tt> or
<tt><i>b</i></tt> but not both is <tt>a^b</tt>
or, equivalently, <tt>a.symmetric_difference(b)</tt>.</p>

<p class="docText">Even if you start with <tt>dict</tt>s for other reasons,
consider using <tt>set</tt>s anyway if you need to perform
set operations. Say, for example, that you have in
<tt><i>phones</i></tt> a dictionary that maps names to
phone numbers and in <tt><i>addresses</i></tt> one that
maps names to addresses. The clearest and simplest way to print all
names for which you know both address and phone number, and their
associated data, is:</p>

<pre>for name in set(phones) &amp; set(addresses):
    print name, phones[name], addresses[name]</pre><br>


<p class="docText">This is much terser, and arguably clearer, than something like:</p>

<pre>for name in phones:
    if name in addresses:
        print name, phones[name], addresses[name]</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Another excellent alternative is:</p>

<pre>for name in set(phones).intersection(addresses):
    print name, phones[name], addresses[name]</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1869"></a>If you
use the named <tt>intersection</tt> method, rather than the
<tt>&amp;</tt> intersection operator, you
don't need to turn both <tt>dict</tt>s
into <tt>set</tt>s: just one of them. Then call
<tt>intersection</tt> on the resulting
<tt>set</tt>, and pass the other <tt>dict</tt> as
the argument to the <tt>intersection</tt> method.</P>
