<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You want to pick an item at random from a list, just about as
<tt>random.choice</tt> does, but you need to pick the
various items with different probabilities given in another list,
rather than picking any item with equal probability as
<tt>random.choice</tt> does.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-21.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1878"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1879"></a>Module <tt>random</tt> in the
standard Python library offers a wealth of possibilities for
generating and using pseudo-random numbers, but it does not offer
this specific functionality, so we must code it as a function of our
own:</p>

<pre>import random
def random_pick(some_list, probabilities):
    x = random.uniform(0, 1)
    cumulative_probability = 0.0
    for item, item_probability in zip(some_list, probabilities):
        cumulative_probability += item_probability
        if x &lt; cumulative_probability: break
    return item</pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-21.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">Module <tt>random</tt> in the standard Python library does
not have the <span class="docEmphasis">weighted choice</span> functionality that
is sometimes needed in games, simulations, and random tests, so I
wrote this recipe to supply this functionality. The recipe uses
module <tt>random</tt>'s function
<tt>uniform</tt> to get a uniformly distributed
pseudo-random number between 0.0 and 1.0, then loops in parallel on
items and their probabilities, computing the increasing cumulative
probability, until the latter becomes greater than the pseudo-random
number.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1880"></a></P>

<p class="docText">The recipe assumes, but does not check, that
<i>probabilities</I> is a sequence with just as many items
as <I>some_list</i>, which are probabilitiesthat is,
numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, summing up to 1.0; if these assumptions
are violated, you may still get some random picks, but they will not
follow the (inconsistent) specifications encoded in the
function's arguments. You may want to add some
<tt>assert</tt> statements at the start of the function to
check that the arguments make sense, such as:</p>

<pre>    assert len(some_list) == len(probabilities)
    assert 0 &lt;= min(probabilities) and max(probabilities) &lt;= 1
    assert abs(sum(probabilities)-1.0) &lt; 1.0e-5</pre><br>


<p class="docText">However, these checks can be quite time consuming, so I
don't normally use them and have not included them
in the official Solution.</p>

<p class="docText">As I already mentioned, the problem solved in this recipe requires
items to be associated with
<span class="docEmphasis">probabilities</span>numbers between 0 and 1,
summing up to 1. A related but slightly different task is to get
random picks with weighted relative probabilities given by small
non-negative integers<span class="docEmphasis">odds</span>, rather than
probabilities. For this related problem, the best solution is a
generator, with an internal structure that is rather different from
the function <I>random_pick</i> given in this
recipe's Solution:</p>

<pre>import random
def random_picks(sequence, relative_odds):
    table = [ z for x, y in zip(sequence, relative_odds) for z in [x]*y ]
    while True:
        yield random.choice(table)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">This generator works by first preparing a table whose total number of
items is <tt>sum(relative_odds)</tt>, each item of
<i>seq</I> appearing in the table as many times as the
small non-negative integer that is its corresponding item in
<i>relative_odds</I>. Once the table is prepared, the
generator's body is tiny and fast, as it simply
delegates to <tt>random.choice</tt> the picking of each
random item it yields. Typical uses of this
<I>random_picks</i> generator might be:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = random_picks('ciao', [1, 1, 3, 2])
&gt;&gt;&gt; for two_chars in zip('boo', x): print ''.join(two_chars),
<b>bc oa oa</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import itertools
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ''.join(itertools.islice(x, 8))
<b>icacaoco</b></pre><br>
