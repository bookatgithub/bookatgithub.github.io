<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1808"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1809"></a>You
want to create a multidimensional list but want to avoid implicit
reference sharing.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-5.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">To build a list and avoid implicit reference sharing, use a list
comprehension. For example, to build a 5 x 10 array of zeros:</p>

<pre>multilist = [[0 for col in range(5)] for row in range(10)]</pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-5.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">When a newcomer to Python is first shown that multiplying a list by
an integer repeats that list that many times, the newcomer often gets
quite excited about it, since it is such an elegant notation. For
example:</P>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; alist = [0] * 5</pre><br>


<p class="docText">is clearly an excellent way to get an array of 5 zeros.</P>

<p class="docText">The problem is that one-dimensional tasks often grow a second
dimension, so there is a natural progression to:</P>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; multi = [[0] * 5] * 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; print multi
<b>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">This appears to work, but the same newcomer is then often puzzled by
bugs, which typically can be boiled down to a snippet such as:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; multi[0][0] = 'oops!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print multi
<b>[['oops!', 0, 0, 0, 0], ['oops!', 0, 0, 0, 0], ['oops!', 0, 0, 0, 0]]</b></pre><BR>


<p class="docText">This issue confuses most programmers at least once, if not a few
times (see the FAQ entry at <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/doc/FAQ.html#4.50">http://www.python.org/doc/FAQ.html#4.50</a>). To
understand the issue, it helps to decompose the creation of the
multidimensional list into two steps:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; row = [0] * 5          # a list with five references to 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; multi = [row] * 3      # a list with three references to the row object</pre><br>


<p class="docText">This decomposed snippet produces a <tt>multi</tt>
that's identical to that given by the more concise
snippet <tt>[[0]*5]*3</tt> shown earlier, and it has
exactly the same problem: if you now assign a value to
<tt>multi[0][0]</tt>, you have also changed the value of
<tt>multi[1][0]</tt> and that of <tt>multi[2][0]</tt>
. . . , and, indeed, you have changed the value of
<tt>row[0]</tt>, too!</P>

<p class="docText">The comments are key to understanding the source of the confusion.
Multiplying a sequence by a number creates a new sequence with the
specified number of new references to the original contents. In the
case of the creation of <tt>row</tt>, it
doesn't matter whether or not references are being
duplicated, since the referent (the object being referred to) is a
number, and therefore immutable. In other words, there is no
practical difference between an object and a reference to an object
if that object is immutable. In the second line, however, we create a
new list containing three references to the contents of the
<tt><i>[row]</I></tt> list, which holds a single reference
to a list. Thus, <tt><i>multi</I></tt> contains three
references to a single list object. So, when the first element of the
first element of <tt><I>multi</i></tt> is changed, you are
actually modifying the first element of the shared list. Hence the
surprise.</p>

<p class="docText">List comprehensions, as shown in the
"Solution", avoid the problem. With
list comprehensions, no sharing of references occursyou have a
truly nested computation. If you have followed the discussion
thoroughly, it may have occurred to you that we
don't really need the <span class="docEmphasis">inner</span>
list comprehension, only the <span class="docEmphasis">outer</span> one. In other
words, couldn't we get just the same effect with:</p>

<pre>multilist = [[0]*5 for row in range(10)]</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The answer is that, yes, we could, and in fact using list
multiplication for the innermost axis and list comprehension for all
outer ones is fasterover twice as fast in this example. So why
don't I recommend this latest solution? Answer: the
speed improvement for this example is from 57 down to 24 microseconds
in Python 2.3, from 49 to 21 in Python 2.4, on a typical PC of
several years ago (AMD Athlon 1.2 GHz CPU, running Linux). Shaving a
few tens of microseconds from a list-creation operation makes no real
difference to your application's performance: and
you should optimize your code, if at all, only where it matters,
where it makes a substantial and important difference to the
performance of your application as a whole. Therefore, I prefer the
code shown in the recipe's Solution, simply because
using the same construct for both the inner and the outer list
creations makes it more conceptually symmetrical and easier to read!</p>
