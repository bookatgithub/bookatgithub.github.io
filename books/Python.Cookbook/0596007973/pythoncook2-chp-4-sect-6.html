<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1811"></a>Some of the items in a sequence may
in turn be sub-sequences, and so on, to arbitrary depth of
"nesting". You need to loop over a
"flattened" sequence,
"expanding" each sub-sequence into
a single, flat sequence of scalar items. (A
<I>scalar</i>, or <I>atom</i>, is
anything that is not a sequencei.e., a
<I>leaf</i>, if you think of the nested sequence as a
tree.)<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1812"></a></P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-SECT-6.2"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1813"></a>We need to be able to tell which of the
elements we're handling are
"subsequences" to be
"expanded" and which are
"scalars" to be yielded as is. For
generality, we can take an argument that's a
<I>predicate</I> to tell us <span class="docEmphasis">what</span>
items we are to expand. (A <span class="docEmphasis">predicate</span> is a
function that we can call on any element and that returns a truth
value: in this case, <tt>true</tt> if the element is a
subsequence we are to expand, <tt>False</tt> otherwise.) By
default, we can arbitrarily say that every <tt>list</tt> or
<tt>tuple</tt> is to be
"expanded", and nothing else. Then,
a recursive generator offers the simplest solution:</p>

<pre>def list_or_tuple(x):
    return isinstance(x, (list, tuple))
def flatten(sequence, to_expand=list_or_tuple):
    for item in sequence:
        if to_expand(item):
            for subitem in flatten(item, to_expand):
                yield subitem
        else:
            yield item</pre><br>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">Flattening a nested sequence, or, equivalently,
"walking" sequentially over all the
leaves of a "tree", is a common
task in many kinds of applications. You start with a nested
structure, with items grouped into sequences and subsequences, and,
for some purposes, you don't care about the
structure at all. You just want to deal with the items, one after the
other. For example,</p>

<pre>for x in flatten([1, 2, [3, [  ], 4, [5, 6], 7, [8,], ], 9]):
    print x,</pre><br>


<p class="docText">emits <tt><B>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</b></tt>.</p>

<p class="docText">The only problem with this common task is that, in the general case,
determining what is to be
"expanded", and what is to be
yielded as a scalar, is not as obvious as it might seem. So, I ducked
that decision, delegating it to a callable predicate argument that
the caller can pass to <I>flatten</i>, unless the caller
accepts <I>flatten</I>'s somewhat
simplistic default behavior of expanding just tuples and lists.</p>

<p class="docText">In the same module as <i>flatten</i>, we should also supply
another predicate that a caller might well want to usea
predicate that will expand just about any iterable
<span class="docEmphasis">except</span> strings (plain and Unicode). Strings are
iterable, but almost invariably applications want to treat them as
scalars, not as subsequences.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1814"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1815"></a>To identify whether an object is
iterable, we just need to try calling the built-in
<tt>iter</tt> on that object: the call raises
<tt>TypeError</tt> if the object is not iterable. To
identify whether an object is string-like, we simply check whether
the object is an instance of <tt>basestring</tt>, since
<tt>isinstance(obj, basestring)</tt> is
<tt>true</tt> when <tt><i>obj</i></tt> is an
instance of any <span class="docEmphasis">subclass</span> of
<tt>basestring</tt>that is, any string-like type.
So, the alternative predicate is not hard to code:</p>

<pre>def nonstring_iterable(obj):
    try: iter(obj)
    except TypeError: return False
    else: return not isinstance(obj, basestring)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Now the caller may choose to call <tt>flatten(seq,
nonstring_iterable)</tt> when the need is to expand any iterable
that is not a string. It is surely better <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> to
make the <i>nonstring_iterable</i> predicate the default
for <i>flatten</i>, though: in a simple case, such as the
example snippet we showed previously, <I>flatten</I> can be
up to three times slower when the predicate is
<i>nonstring_iterable</i> rather than
<I>list_or_tuple</i>.</p>

<p class="docText">We can also write a nonrecursive version of generator
<i>flatten</i>. Such a version lets you flatten nested
sequences with nesting levels higher than Python's
recursion limit, which normally allows no more than a few thousand
levels of recursion depth. The main technique for recursion removal
is to keep an explicit last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack, which, in
this case, we can implement with a list of iterators:</p>

<pre>def flatten(sequence, to_expand=list_or_tuple):
    iterators = [ iter(sequence) ]
    while iterators:
        # loop on the currently most-nested (last) iterator
        for item in iterators[-1]:
            if to_expand(item):
                # subsequence found, go loop on iterator on subsequence
                iterators.append(iter(item))
                break
            else:
                yield item
        else:
            # most-nested iterator exhausted, go back, loop on its parent
            iterators.pop( )</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The <tt>if</tt> clause of the <tt>if</tt>
statement executes for any item we are to expandthat is, any
subsequence on which we must loop; so in that clause, we push an
iterator for the subsequence to the end of the stack, then execute a
<tt>break</tt> to terminate the <tt>for</tt>, and
go back to the outer <tt>while</tt>, which will in turn
execute a new <tt>for</tt> statement on the iterator we
just appended to the stack. The <tt>else</tt> clause of the
<tt>if</tt> statement executes for any item we
don't expand, and it just <tt>yield</tt>s
the item.</P>

<p class="docText">The <tt>else</tt> clause of the <tt>for</tt>
statement executes if no <tt>break</tt> statement
interrupts the <tt>for</tt> loopin other words, when
the <tt>for</tt> loop runs to completion, exhausting the
currently most-nested iterator. So, in that <tt>else</tt>
clause, we remove the now-exhausted most-nested (last) iterator, and
the outer <tt>while</tt> loop proceeds, either terminating
if no iterators are left on the stack, or executing a new
<tt>for</tt> statement that continues the loop on the
iterator that's back at the top of the
stackfrom wherever that iterator had last left off,
intrinsically, because an iterator's job is exactly
to remember iteration state.</p>

<p class="docText">The results of this nonrecursive implementation of
<I>flatten</i> are identical to those of the simpler
recursive version given in this recipe's Solution.
If you think non-recursive implementations are faster than recursive
ones, though, you may be disappointed: according to my measurements,
the nonrecursive version is about 10% <span class="docEmphasis">slower</span>
than the recursive one, across a range of cases.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-4-ITERM-1816"></a></P>
