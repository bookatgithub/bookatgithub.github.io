<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1970"></a>You want to
use a dictionary to store the mapping between some keys and a current
score value for each key. You frequently need to access the keys and
scores in natural order (meaning, in order of ascending scores) and
to check on a
"key"'s current
ranking in that order, so that using just a <tt>dict</tt>
isn't quite enough.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-14.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">We can subclass <tt>dict</tt> and add or override methods
as needed. By using multiple inheritance, placing base
<tt>UserDict.DictMixin</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">before</span>
base <tt>dict</tt> and carefully arranging our various
delegations and "over"rides, we can
achieve a good balance between getting good performance and avoiding
the need to write "boilerplate"
code.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1971"></a>By enriching
our class with many examples in its docstring, we can use the
standard library's module <tt>doctest</tt>
to give us unit-testing functionality, as well as ensuring the
accuracy of all the examples we write in the docstring:</P>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env python
''' An enriched dictionary that holds a mapping from keys to scores '''
from bisect import bisect_left, insort_left
import UserDict
class Ratings(UserDict.DictMixin, dict):
    """ class Ratings is mostly like a dictionary, with extra features: the
        value corresponding to each key is the 'score' for that key, and all
        keys are ranked in terms their scores.  Values must be comparable; keys,
        as well as being hashable, must be comparable if any two keys may ever
        have the same corresponding value (i.e., may be "tied" on score).
        All mapping-like behavior is just as you would expect, such as:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r = Ratings({"bob": 30, "john": 30})
        &gt;&gt;&gt; len(r)
        <b>2</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.has_key("paul"), "paul" in r
 <B>       (False, False)</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r["john"] = 20
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.update({"paul": 20, "tom": 10})
        &gt;&gt;&gt; len(r)
        <B>4</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.has_key("paul"), "paul" in r
 <b>       (True, True)</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; [r[key] for key in ["bob", "paul", "john", "tom"]]
 <B>       [30, 20, 20, 10]</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.get("nobody"), r.get("nobody", 0)
 <B>       (None, 0)</b>
        In addition to the mapping interface, we offer rating-specific
        methods.  r.rating(key) returns the ranking of a "key" in the
        ratings, with a ranking of 0 meaning the lowest score (when two
        keys have equal scores, the keys themselves are compared, to
        "break the tie", and the lesser key gets a lower ranking):
        &gt;&gt;&gt; [r.rating(key) for key in ["bob", "paul", "john", "tom"]]
<b>        [3, 2, 1, 0]</b>
        getValueByRating(ranking) and getKeyByRating(ranking) return the
        score and key, respectively, for a given ranking index:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; [r.getValueByRating(rating) for rating in range(4)]
<b>        [10, 20, 20, 30]</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; [r.getKeyByRating(rating) for rating in range(4)]
<b>        ['tom', 'john', 'paul', 'bob']</b>
        An important feature is that the keys( ) method returns keys in
        ascending order of ranking, and all other related methods return
        lists or iterators fully consistent with this ordering:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.keys( )
  <b>      ['tom', 'john', 'paul', 'bob']</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; [key for key in r]
<B>        ['tom', 'john', 'paul', 'bob']</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; [key for key in r.iterkeys( )]
<b>        ['tom', 'john', 'paul', 'bob']</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.values( )
<b>        [10, 20, 20, 30]</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; [value for value in r.itervalues( )]
<B>        [10, 20, 20, 30]</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.items( )
<b>        [('tom', 10), ('john', 20), ('paul', 20), ('bob', 30)]</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; [item for item in r.iteritems( )]
<B>        [('tom', 10), ('john', 20), ('paul', 20), ('bob', 30)]</b>
        An instance can be modified (adding, changing and deleting
        key-score correspondences), and every method of that instance
        reflects the instance's current state at all times:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r["tom"] = 100
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.items( )
<b>        [('john', 20), ('paul', 20), ('bob', 30), ('tom', 100)]</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; del r["paul"]
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.items( )
<B>        [('john', 20), ('bob', 30), ('tom', 100)]</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r["paul"] = 25
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.items( )
<B>        [('john', 20), ('paul', 25), ('bob', 30), ('tom', 100)]</b>
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.clear( )
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r.items( )
<b>        [  ]</b>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">In many ways, a dictionary is the natural data structure for storing
a correspondence between keys (e.g., names of contestants in a
competition) and the current
"score" of each key (e.g., the
number of points a contestant has scored so far, or the highest bid
made by each contestant at an auction, etc.). If we use a dictionary
for such purposes, we will probably want to access it often in
<span class="docEmphasis">natural order</span>the order in which the
keys' scores are ascendingand
we'll also want fast access to the rankings
(ratings) implied by the current
"score"s (e.g., the contestant
currently in third place, the score of the contestant who is in
second place, etc.).</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1972"></a>To achieve these
purposes, this recipe subclasses <tt>dict</tt> to add the
needed functionality that is completely missing from
<tt>dict</tt> (methods <i>rating</i>,
<i>getValueByRating</i>, <i>getKeyByRating</i>),
and, more subtly and crucially, to modify method
<tt>keys</tt> and all other related methods so that they
return lists or iterators with the required order (i.e., the order in
which scores are ascending; if we have to break ties when two keys
have the same score, we implicitly compare the keys themselves). Most
of the detailed documentation is in the docstring of the class
itselfa crucial issue because by keeping the documentation and
examples there, we can use module <tt>doctest</tt> from the
Python Standard Library to provide unit-testing functionality, as
well as ensuring that our examples are correct.</p>

<p class="docText">The most interesting aspect of the implementation is that it takes
good care to minimize boilerplate (meaning repetitious and boring
code, and therefore code where bugs are most likely to hide) without
seriously impairing performance. <tt>class Ratings</tt>
multiply inherits from <tt>dict</tt>
<span class="docEmphasis">and</span> <tt>DictMixin</tt>, with the
latter placed <span class="docEmphasis">first</span> in the list of bases, so
that all methods come from the mixin, if it provides them, unless
explicitly overridden in the class.</p>

<p class="docText">Raymond Hettinger's <tt>DictMixin</tt>
class was originally posted as a recipe to the online version of the
<span class="docEmphasis">Python</span> <span class="docEmphasis">Cookbook</span> and later
became part of Python 2.3's standard library.
<tt>DictMixin</tt> provides all the methods of a mapping
except <tt>_ _init_ _</tt>, <tt>copy</tt>, and
the four fundamental methods: <tt>_ _getitem_ _</tt>,
<tt>_ _setitem_ _</tt>, <tt>_ _delitem_ _</tt>,
and, last but not least, <tt>keys</tt>. If you are coding a
mapping class and want to ensure that your class supports all of the
many methods that a full mapping provides to application code, you
should subclass <tt>DictMixin</tt> and supply at least the
fundamental methods (depending on your class'
semanticse.g., if your class has immutable instances, you need
not supply the mutator methods <tt>_ _setitem_ _</tt> and
<tt>_ _delitem_ _</tt>). You may optionally implement other
methods for performance purposes, overriding the implementation that
<tt>DictMixin</tt> provides. The whole
<tt>DictMixin</tt> architecture can be seen as an excellent
example of the classic Template Method Design Pattern, applied
pervasively in a useful mix-in variant.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1973"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1974"></a></P>

<p class="docText">In this recipe's class, we inherit <tt>_
_getitem_ _</tt> from our other base (namely, the built-in type
<tt>dict</tt>), and we also delegate explicitly to
<tt>dict</tt> everything we can for performance reasons. We
have to code the elementary mutator methods (<tt>_ _setitem_
_</tt> and <tt>_ _delitem_ _</tt>) because, in
addition to delegating to our base class <tt>dict</tt>, we
need to maintain our auxiliary data structure
<I>self._rating</i>a list of <tt>(score,
key)</tt> pairs that we keep in sorted order with the help of
standard library module <tt>bisect</tt>. We implement
<tt>keys</tt> ourselves (and while we're
at it, we implement <tt>_ _iter_ _</tt> i.e.,
<tt>iterkeys</tt> as well, since clearly
<tt>keys</tt> is easiest to implement by using <tt>_
_iter_ _</tt>) to exploit <i>self._rating</I> and
return the keys in the order we need. Finally, we add the obvious
implementations for <tt>_ _init_ _</tt> and
<tt>copy</tt>, in addition to the three, ratings-specific
methods that we supply.</p>

<p class="docText">The result is quite an interesting example of balancing concision,
clarity, and well-advised reuse of the enormous amount of
functionality that the standard Python library places at our
disposal. If you use this module in your applications, profiling may
reveal that a method that this recipe's class
inherits from <tt>DictMixin</tt> has somewhat
unsatisfactory performanceafter all, the implementations in
<tt>DictMixin</tt> are, of necessity, somewhat generic. If
this is the case, by all means add a direct implementation of
whatever further methods you need to achieve maximum performance! For
example, if your application performs a lot of looping on the result
of calling <tt>r.iteritems( )</tt> for some instance
<tt><i>r</i></tt> of class <i>Ratings</i>, you
may get slightly better performance by adding to the body of the
class the direct implementation of the method:</p>

        for v, k in self._rating:
            yield k, v</pre><BR>
