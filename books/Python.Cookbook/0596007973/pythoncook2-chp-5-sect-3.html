<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1914"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1915"></a>You need to sort a
list of objects according to one attribute of each object.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-3.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">The DSU idiom shines, as usual:</p>

<pre>def sort_by_attr(seq, attr):
    intermed = [ (getattr(x, attr), i, x) for i, x in enumerate(seq) ]
    intermed.sort( )
    return [ x[-1] for x in intermed ]
def sort_by_attr_inplace(lst, attr):
    lst[:] = sort_by_attr(lst, attr)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">In Python 2.4, DSU is natively supported, so your code can be even
shorter and faster:</p>

<pre>import operator
def sort_by_attr(seq, attr):
    return sorted(seq, key=operator.attrgetter(attr))
def sort_by_attr_inplace(lst, attr):
    lst.sort(key=operator.attrgetter(attr))</pre><BR>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">Sorting a list of objects by an attribute of each object is best done
using the DSU idiom introduced previously in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-2.html#pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-2">Recipe 5.2</a>. In Python 2.3 and 2.4, DSU
is no longer needed, as it used to be, to ensure that a sort is
stable (sorting is always stable in Python 2.3 and later), but
DSU's speed advantages still shine.</P>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1916"></a>Sorting, in the
general case and with the best algorithms, is
<tt>O(</tt><tt><I>n</i></tt> <tt>log</tt>
<tt><i>n</i></tt><tt>)</tt> (as is
often the case in mathematical formulas, the juxtaposition of terms,
here <tt><i>n</I></tt> and <tt>log</tt>
<tt><i>n</i></tt>, indicates that the terms are
multiplied). DSU's speed comes from maximally
accelerating the
<tt>O(</tt><tt><I>n</i></tt> <tt>log</tt>
<tt><I>n</i></tt><tt>)</tt> part,
which dominates sorting time for sequences of substantial length
<tt><I>n</I></tt>, by using only Python's
native (and maximally fast) comparison. The preliminary
<i>decoration</i> step, which prepares an
intermediate auxiliary list of tuples, and the successive
<i>undecoration</i> step, which extracts the
important item from each tuple after the intermediate list is sorted,
are only
<tt>O(</tt><tt><i>n</i></tt><tt>)</tt>.
Therefore any minor inefficiencies in these steps contribute
negligible overhead if <tt><i>n</i></tt> is large enough,
and reasonably little even for many practical values of
<tt><i>n</i></tt>.</p>

<H2 class="docSidebarTitle">The O( )-Notation</h2>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1917"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1918"></a>The most useful way to reason
about many performance issues is in terms of what is popularly known
as <span class="docEmphasis">big-O</span> analysis and notation (the
<tt>O</tt> stands for
"order"). You can find detailed
explanations, for example, at <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation</a>,
but here's a summary.</p>

<p class="docText">If we consider an algorithm applied to input data of some size
<tt><I>N</i></tt>, running time can be described, for
large enough values of <tt><i>N</i></tt> (and big inputs
are often those for which performance is most critical), as being
proportional to some function of <tt><i>N</i></tt>. This
is indicated with notations such as
<tt>O(</tt><tt><i>N</I></tt><tt>)</tt>
(running time proportional to <tt><i>N</I></tt>:
processing twice as much data takes about twice as much time, 10
times as much data, 10 times as much time, and so on; also known as
<i>linear time</I>),
<tt>O(</tt><tt><i>N</I></tt>
<tt>squared)</tt> (running time proportional to the square of
<tt><I>N</i></tt>: processing twice as much data takes
about four times as much time, 10 times as much data, 100 times as
much time; also known as <I>quadratic time</I>), and
so on. Another case you will see often is
<tt>O(</tt><tt><i>N</i></tt> <tt>log</tt>
<tt><i>N</i></tt><tt>)</tt>, which is
faster than
<tt>O(</tt><tt><I>N</i></tt>
<tt>squared)</tt> but not as fast as
<tt>O(</tt><tt><i>N</I></tt><tt>)</tt>.</p>

<p class="docText">The constant of proportionality is often ignored (at least in
theoretical analysis) because it depends on such issues as the clock
rate of your computer, not just on the algorithm. If you buy a
machine that's twice as fast as your old one,
everything will run in half the time, but that will not change any of
the comparisons between alternative algorithms.</P>

<p class="docText">This recipe puts index <tt><i>i</i></tt>, in each tuple
that is an item of list <tt><i>intermed</i></tt>,
<span class="docEmphasis">ahead</span> of the corresponding
<tt><i>x</i></tt> (where <tt><i>x</i></tt> is
the <tt><i>i</i></tt>-th item in
<tt><i>seq</i></tt>). This placement ensures that two
items of <tt><I>seq</I></tt> will never be compared
directly, even if they have the same value for the attribute named
<tt><i>attr</i></tt>. Even in that case, their indices
will still differ, and thus Python's lexicographic
comparison of the tuples will never get all the way to comparing the
tuples' last items (the original items from
<tt><I>seq</i></tt>). Avoiding object comparisons may save
us from performing extremely slow operations, or even from attempting
forbidden ones. For example, we could sort a list of complex numbers
by their <tt>real</tt> attribute: we would get an exception
if we ever tried to compare two complex numbers directly, because no
ordering is defined on complex numbers. But thanks to the precaution
described in this paragraph, such an event can never occur, and the
sorting will therefore proceed correctly.</p>

<p class="docText">As mentioned earlier in <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-2.html#pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-2">Recipe 5.2</a>, Python 2.4 supports DSU
directly. You can pass an optional keyword-argument
<tt>key</tt>, to <tt>sort</tt>, which is the
callable to use on each item to get the sort key. Standard library
module <tt>operator</tt> has two new functions,
<tt>attrgetter</tt> and <tt>itemgetter</tt>, that
exist specifically to return callables suitable for this purpose. In
Python 2.4, the ideal solution to this problem therefore becomes:</p>

<pre>import operator
seq.sort(key=operator.attrgetter(attr))</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1919"></a>This snippet performs the sort
in-place, which helps make it blazingly faston my machine,
three times faster than the Python 2.3 function shown first in this
recipe. If you need a sorted copy, without disturbing
<tt><i>seq</i></tt>, you can get it using Python
2.4's new built-in function
<tt>sorted</tt>:</P>

<pre>sorted_copy = sorted(seq, key=operator.attrgetter(attr))</pre><br>


<p class="docText">While not quite as fast as an in-place sort, this latest snippet is
still over 2.5 times faster than the function shown first in this
recipe. Python 2.4 also guarantees that, when you pass the optional
<tt>key</tt> named argument, list items will never be
accidentally compared directly, so you need not take any special
safeguards. Moreover, stability is also guaranteed.</P>
