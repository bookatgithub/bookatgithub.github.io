<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1929"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1930"></a>You need to process, in random
order, all of the items of a long list.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-6.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">As usual in Python, the best approach is the simplest one. If we are
allowed to change the order of items in the input list, then the
following function is simplest and fastest:</p>

<pre>def process_all_in_random_order(data, process):
    # first, put the whole list into random order
    random.shuffle(data)
    # next, just walk over the list linearly
    for elem in data: process(elem)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">If we must preserve the input list intact, or if the input data may
be some iterable that is not a list, just insert as the first
statement of the function the assignment <tt>data</tt>
<tt>= list(data)</tt>.</p>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-6.3"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1931"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1932"></a>While it's a common
mistake to be overly concerned with speed, don't
make the opposite mistake of ignoring the different performances of
various algorithms. Suppose we must process all of the items in a
long list in random order, without repetition (assume that
we're allowed to mangle or destroy the input list).
The first idea to suggest itself might be to repeatedly pick an item
at random (with function <tt>random.choice</tt>), removing
each picked item from the list to avoid future repetitions:</p>

<pre>import random
def process_random_removing(data, process):
    while data:
        elem = random.choice(data) 
        data.remove(elem) 
        process(elem)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">However, this function is painfully slow, even for input lists of
just a few hundred elements. Each call to
<tt>data.remove</tt> must linearly search through the list
to find the element to delete. Since the cost of each of
<tt><I>n</i></tt> steps is <tt>O(n)</tt>, the
whole process is
<tt>O(</tt><tt><i>n</i></tt><tt>2)</tt>time
proportional to the <span class="docEmphasis">square</span> of the length of the
list (and with a large multiplicative constant, too).</p>

<p class="docText">Minor improvements to this first idea could focus on obtaining random
indices, using the <tt>pop</tt> method of the list to get
and remove an item at the same time, low-level fiddling with indices
to avoid the costly removal in favor of swapping the picked item with
the last yet-unpicked one towards the end, or using dictionaries or
sets instead of lists. This latest idea might be based on a hope of
using a <tt>dict</tt>'s
<tt>popitem</tt> method (or the equivalent method
<tt>pop</tt> of class <tt>sets.Set</tt> and
Python 2.4's built-in type <tt>set</tt>),
which may look like it's designed exactly to pick
and remove a random item, but, <span class="docEmphasis">beware</span>!
<tt>dict.popitem</tt> is documented to return and remove an
<span class="docEmphasis">arbitrary</span> item of the dictionary, and
that's a far cry from a <span class="docEmphasis">random</span>
item. Check it out:</P>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; d=dict(enumerate('ciao'))
&gt;&gt;&gt; while d: print d.popitem( )</pre><br>


<p class="docText">It may surprise you, but in most Python implementations this snippet
will print <tt><i>d</I></tt>'s items in a
far from random order, typically <tt>(0,'c')</tt> then
<tt>(1,'i')</tt> and so forth. In short, if you need
pseudo-random behavior in Python, you need standard library module
<tt>random</tt><tt>popitem</tt> is not an
alternative.</p>

<p class="docText">If you thought about using a dictionary rather than a list, you are
definitely on your way to "thinking
Pythonically", even though it turns out that
dictionaries wouldn't provide a substantial
performance boost for this specific problem. However, an approach
that is even more Pythonic than choosing the right data structure is
best summarized as: let the standard library do it!. The Python
Standard Library is large, rich, and chock full of useful, robust,
fast functions and classes for a wide variety of tasks. In this case,
the key intuition is realizing that, to walk over a sequence in a
random order, the simplest approach is to first
<span class="docEmphasis">put</span> that sequence into random order (known as
<span class="docEmphasis">shuffling the sequence</span>, an analogy with
shuffling a deck of cards) and then walk over the shuffled sequence
linearly. Function <tt>random.shuffle</tt> performs the
shuffling, and the function shown in this recipe's
Solution just uses it.</P>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1933"></a>Performance should always be
measured, never guessed at, and that's what standard
library module <tt>timeit</tt> is for. Using a null
<tt>process</tt> function and a list of length 1,000 as
<tt>data</tt>, <i>process_all_in_random_order</I>
is almost 10 times faster than
<I>process_random_removing</i>; with a list of length
2,000, the performance ratio grows to almost 20. While an improvement
of, say, 25%, or even a constant factor of 2, usually can be
neglected without really affecting the performance of your program as
a whole, the same does not apply to an algorithm that is 10 or 20
times as slow as it could be. Such terrible performance is likely to
make that program fragment a bottleneck, all by itself. Moreover,
this risk increases when we're talking about
<tt>O(</tt><tt><i>n</i></tt><tt>2)</tt>
versus
<tt>O(</tt><tt><i>n</i></tt><tt>)</tt>
behavior: with such differences in big-O behavior, the performance
ratio between bad and good algorithms keeps increasing without bounds
as the size of the input data grows.</p>
