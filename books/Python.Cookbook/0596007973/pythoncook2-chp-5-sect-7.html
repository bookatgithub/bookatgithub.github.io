<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-7.1"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1934"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1935"></a>You want to
maintain a sequence, to which items are added, in a sorted state, so
that at any time, you can easily examine or remove the smallest item
currently present in the sequence.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-7.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">Say you start with an unordered list, such as:</p>

<pre>the_list = [903, 10, 35, 69, 933, 485, 519, 379, 102, 402, 883, 1]</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">You could call <tt>the_list.sort( )</tt> to make the list
sorted and then <tt>result=the_list.pop(0)</tt> to get and
remove the smallest item. But then, every time you add an item (say
with <tt>the_list.append(0)</tt>), you need to call
<tt>the_list.sort( )</tt> again to keep the list sorted.</p>

<p class="docText">Alternatively, you can use the <tt>heapq</tt> module of the
Python Standard Library:</P>

<pre>import heapq
heapq.heapify(the_list)</pre><BR>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1936"></a>Now the list
is not necessarily fully sorted, but it does satisfy the
<i>heap property</I> (meaning if all indices involved
are valid, <tt>the_list[i]&lt;=the_list[2*i+1]</tt> and
<tt>the_list[i]&lt;=the_list[2*i+2]</tt>)so, in
particular, <tt>the_list[0]</tt> is the smallest item. To
keep the heap property valid, use
<tt>result=heapq.heappop(the_list)</tt> to get and remove
the smallest item and <tt>heapq.heappush(the_list,
newitem)</tt> to add a new item. When you need to do
bothadd a new item while getting and removing the previously
smallest itemyou can use
<tt>result=heapq.heapreplace(the_list</tt>,
<tt>newitem)</tt>.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-7.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">When you need to retrieve data in an ordered way (at each retrieval
getting the smallest item among those you currently have at hand),
you can pay the runtime cost for the sorting when you retrieve the
data, or you can pay for it when you add the data. One approach is to
collect your data into a list and sort the list. Now
it's easy to get your data in order, smallest to
largest. However, you have to keep calling <tt>sort</tt>
each time you add new data during the retrieval, to make sure you can
later keep retrieving from the smallest current item after each
addition. The method <tt>sort</tt> of Python lists is
implemented with a little-known algorithm called <span class="docEmphasis">Natural
Mergesort</span>, which minimizes the runtime cost of this
approach. Yet the approach can still be burdensome: each addition
(and sorting) and each retrieval (and removal, via
<tt>pop</tt>) takes time proportional to the number of
current items in the list (<tt>O(N)</tt>, in common
parlance).</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1937"></a>An alternative
approach is to use a data organization known as a
<i>heap</I>, a type of binary tree implemented
compactly, yet ensuring that each
"parent" is always less than its
"children". The best way to
maintain a heap in Python is to use a <tt>list</tt> and
have it managed by the <tt>heapq</tt> library module, as
shown in this recipe's Solution. The list does not
get fully sorted, yet you can be sure that, whenever you
<tt>heappop</tt> an item from the list, you always get the
lowest item currently present, and all others will be adjusted to
ensure the heap property is still valid. Each addition with
<tt>heappush</tt>, and each removal with
<tt>heappop</tt>, takes a short time proportional to the
logarithm of the current length of the list (<tt>O(log
N)</tt>, in common parlance). You pay as you go, a little at a
time (and not too much in total, either.)</p>

<p class="docText">A good occasion to use this heap approach, for example, is when you
have a long-running queue with new data periodically arriving, and
you always want to be able to get the most important item off the
queue without having to constantly re-sort your data or perform full
searches. This concept is known as a <span class="docEmphasis">priority
queue</span>, and a heap is an excellent way to implement it.
Note that, intrinsically, the <tt>heapq</tt> module
supplies you with the <span class="docEmphasis">smallest</span> item at each
<tt>heappop</tt>, so make sure to arrange the way you
encode your items' priority values to reflect this.
For example, say that you receive incoming items each accompanied by
a cost, and the most important item at any time is the one with the
highest cost that is currently on the queue; moreover, among items of
equal cost, the most important one is the one that arrived earliest.
Here's a way to build a "priority
queue" class respecting these specs and based on
functions of module
<tt>heapq</tt>:<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1938"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-5-ITERM-1939"></a></p>

<pre>class prioq(object):
    def _ _init_ _(self):
        self.q = [  ]
        self.i = 0
    def push(self, item, cost):
        heapq.heappush(self.q, (-cost, self.i, item))
        self.i += 1
    def pop(self):
        return heapq.heappop(self.q)[-1]</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">The main idea in this snippet is to push on the heap tuples whose
first item is the cost <span class="docEmphasis">with changed sign</span>, so
that <span class="docEmphasis">higher</span> costs result in
<span class="docEmphasis">smaller</span> tuples (by Python's
natural comparison); right after the cost, we put a progressive
index, so that, among items with equal cost, the one arriving
earliest will be in a smaller tuple.</p>

and optimized; see <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-8.html#pythoncook2-CHP-5-SECT-8">Recipe 5.8</a> for more information about
