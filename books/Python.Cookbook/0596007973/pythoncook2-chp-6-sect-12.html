solution is a <i>mixin class</I>a class you

<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">I often need change-checking functionality in my applications. For
example, when a user closes the last GUI window over a certain
document, I need to check whether the document was changed since the
last "save" operation; if it was,
then I need to pop up a small window to give the user a choice
between saving the document, losing the latest changes, or canceling
the window-closing operation.</P>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-ITERM-2166"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-ITERM-2167"></a>The class
<I>ChangeCheckerMixin</i>, which this recipe describes,
satisfies this need. The idea is to multiply derive all of your data
classes, meaning all classes that hold data the user views and may
change, from <i>ChangeCheckerMixin</i> (as well as from any
other bases they need). When the data has just been loaded from or
saved to persistent storage, call method <i>snapshot</I> on
the top-level, document data class instance. This call takes a
"snapshot" of the current state,
basically a shallow copy of the object but with recursion over
containers, and calls the <i>snapshot</i> methods on any
contained instance that has such a method. Any time afterward, you
can call method <I>isChanged</i> on any data class instance
to check whether the instance state was changed since the time of its
last snapshot.</P>

<p class="docText">As container types, <i>ChangeCheckerMixin</I>, as
presented, considers only <tt>list</tt> and
<tt>dict</tt>. If you also use other types as containers,
you just need to add them appropriately to the
<I>containerItems</i> dictionary. That dictionary must map
each container type to a function callable on an instance of that
type to get an iterator on indices and values (with indices usable to
index the container). Container type instances must also support
being shallowly copied with standard library Python function
<tt>copy.copy</tt>. For example, to add Python
2.4's <tt>collections.deque</tt> as a
container to a subclass of <i>ChangeCheckerMixin</i>, you
can code:</p>

<pre>import collections
class CCM_with_deque(ChangeCheckerMixin):
    containerItems = dict(ChangeCheckerMixin.containerItems)
    containerItems[collections.deque] = enumerate</pre><br>


<p class="docText">since <tt>collections.deque</tt> can be
"walked over" with
<tt>enumerate</tt>, just like <tt>list</tt> can.</p>

<p class="docText">Here is a toy example of use for <i>ChangeChecherMixin</i>:</p>

<pre>if _ _name_ _ == '_ _main_ _':
    class eg(ChangeCheckerMixin):
        def _ _init_ _(self, *a, **k):
            self.L = list(*a, **k)
        def _ _str_ _(self):
            return 'eg(%s)' % str(self.L)
        def _ _getattr_ _(self, a):
            return getattr(self.L, a)
    x = eg('ciao')
    print 'x =', x, 'is changed =', x.isChanged( )
    # emits:<b> x = eg(['c', 'i', 'a', 'o']) is changed = True</b>
    # now, assume x gets saved, then...:
    x.snapshot( )
    print 'x =', x, 'is changed =', x.isChanged( )
    # emits: <b>x = eg(['c', 'i', 'a', 'o']) is changed = False</b>
    # now we change x...:
    x.append('x')
    print 'x =', x, 'is changed =', x.isChanged( )
    # emits: <b>x = eg(['c', 'i', 'a', 'o', 'x']) is changed = True</b></pre><br>


<p class="docText">In class <tt>eg</tt> we only subclass
<I>ChanceCheckerMixin</I> because we need no other bases.
In particular, we cannot usefully subclass <tt>list</tt>
because the change-checking functionality works only on state that is
kept in an instance's dictionary; so, we must hold a
list object in our instance's dictionary, and
delegate to it as needed (in this toy example, we delegate all
nonspecial methods, automatically, via <tt>_ _getattr_
_</tt>). With this precaution, we see that the
<i>isChanged</i> method correctly reflects the crucial
tidbitwhether the instance's state has been
changed since the last call to <I>snapshot</i> on the
instance.</p>

<p class="docText">An implicit assumption of this recipe is that your
application's data class instances are organized in
a hierarchical fashion. The tired old (but still valid) example is an
invoice containing header data and detail lines. Each instance of the
details data class could contain other instances, such as product
details, which may not be modifiable in the current activity but are
probably modifiable elsewhere. This is the reason for the
<i>immutable</i> attribute and the
<i>makeImmutable</i> method: when the attribute is set by
calling the method, any outstanding snapshot for the instance is
dropped to save memory, and further calls to either
<I>snapshot</i> or <I>isChanged</i> can return
very rapidly.</P>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-ITERM-2168"></a>If your data does not lend itself to such
hierarchical structuring, you may have to take full deep copies, or
even "snapshot" a document instance
by taking a full pickle of it, and check for changes by comparing the
new pickle with the last one previously taken. That may be all right
on very fast machines, or when the amount of data
you're handling is rather modest. In my tests,
however, it shows up as being unacceptably slow for substantial
amounts of data on more ordinary machines. This recipe, when your
data organization is suitable for its application, can offer better
performance. If some of your data classes also contain data that is
automatically computed or, for other reasons, does not need to be
saved, store such data in instances of subordinate classes (which do
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> inherit from
<i>ChangeCheckerMixin</I>), rather than either holding the
data as attributes or storing it in ordinary containers such as lists
and dictionaries.</P>
