<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText">You want to ensure that <tt>_ _init_ _</tt> is called for
all superclasses that define it, and Python does not do this
automatically.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-SECT-19.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">As long as your class is new-style, the built-in
<tt>super</tt> makes this task easy (if all
superclasses' <tt>_ _init_ _</tt> methods
also use <tt>super</tt> similarly):</p>

<pre>class NewStyleOnly(A, B, C):
    def _ _init_ _(self):
        <span class="docEmphBold">super(NewStyleOnly, self)._ _init_ _( )</span>
        <I>initialization specific to subclass NewStyleOnly</i></pre><BR>



<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-SECT-19.3"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-ITERM-2222"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-ITERM-2223"></a>Classic classes are
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> recommended for new code development: they
exist only to guarantee backwards compatibility with old versions of
Python. Use new-style classes (deriving directly or indirectly from
<tt>object</tt>) for all new code. The only thing you
cannot do with a new-style class is to <tt>raise</tt> its
instances as exception objects; exception classes must therefore be
old style, but then, you do not need the functionality of this recipe
for such classes. Since the rest of this recipe's
Discussion is therefore both advanced and of limited applicability,
you may want to skip it.</P>

<p class="docText">Still, it may happen that you need to retrofit this functionality
into a classic class, or, more likely, into a new-style class with
some superclasses that do <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> follow the proper
style of cooperative superclass method-calling with the built-in
<tt>super</tt>. In such cases, you should first try to fix
the problematic premisesmake all classes new style and make
them use <tt>super</tt> properly. If you absolutely cannot
fix things, the best you can do is to have your class loop over its
base classesfor each base, check whether it has an <tt>_
_init_ _</tt>, and if so, then call it:</P>

<pre>class LookBeforeYouLeap(X, Y, Z):
    def _ _init_ _(self):
        for base in self_ _class_ _._ _bases_ _:
            if hasattr(base, '_ _init_ _'):
                base._ _init_ _(self)
        <i>initialization specific to subclass LookBeforeYouLeap</i></pre><br>


<p class="docText">More generally, and not just for method <tt>_ _init_
_</tt>, we often want to call a method on an instance, or class,
if and only if that method exists; if the method does not exist on
that class or instance, we do nothing, or we default to another
action. The technique shown in the
"Solution", based on built-in
<tt>super</tt>, is not applicable in general: it only works
on superclasses of the current object, only if those superclasses
also use <tt>super</tt> appropriately, and only if the
method in question does exist in some superclass. Note that all
new-style classes do have an <tt>_ _init_ _</tt> method:
they all subclass <tt>object</tt>, and
<tt>object</tt> defines <tt>_ _init_ _</tt> (as a
do-nothing function that accepts and ignores any arguments).
Therefore, all new-style classes have an <tt>_ _init_
_</tt> method, either by inheritance or by override.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-ITERM-2224"></a>The
LBYL technique shown in class <I>LookBeforeYouLeap</i> may
be of help in more general cases, including ones that involve methods
other than <tt>_ _init_ _</tt>. Indeed, LBYL may even be
used <span class="docEmphasis">together</span> with <tt>super</tt>, for
example, as in the following toy example:</p>

<pre>class Base1(object):
    def met(self):
        print 'met in Base1'
class Der1(Base1):
    def met(self):
        s = super(Der1, self)
        if hasattr(s, 'met'):
            s.met( )
        print 'met in Der1'
class Base2(object):
    pass
class Der2(Base2):
    def met(self):
        s = super(Der2, self)
        if hasattr(s, 'met'):
            s.met( )
        print 'met in Der2'
Der1( ).met( )
Der2( ).met( )</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">This snippet emits:</p>

<pre>met in Base1
met in Der1
met in Der2</pre><BR>


<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-ITERM-2225"></a>The
implementation of <i>met</I> has the same structure in both
derived classes, <I>Der1</i> (whose superclass
<i>Base1</i> <span class="docEmphasis">does</span> have a method named
<i>met</i>) and <i>Der2</i> (whose superclass
<i>Base1</i> <span class="docEmphasis">doesn't</span>
have such a method). By binding a local name
<tt><i>s</i></tt> to the result of
<tt>super</tt>, and checking with
<tt>hasattr</tt> that the superclass does have such a
method before calling it, this LBYL structure lets you code in the
same way in both cases. Of course, when coding a subclass, you
<span class="docEmphasis">do</span> normally know which methods the superclasses
have, and whether and how you need to call them. Still, this
technique can provide a little extra flexibility for those occasions
in which you need to slightly decouple the subclass from the
superclass.</p>

<p class="docText">The LBYL technique is far from perfect, though: a superclass might
define an attribute named <i>met</I>, which is not callable
or needs a different number of arguments. If your need for
flexibility is so extreme that you must ward against such
occurrences, you can extract the superclass' method
object (if any) and check it with the <tt>getargspec</tt>
function of standard library module <tt>inspect</tt>.</P>

<p class="docText">While pushing this idea towards full generality can lead into rather
deep complications, here is one example of how you might code a class
with a method that calls the superclass' version of
the same method only if the latter is callable without arguments:</p>

<pre>import inspect
class Der(A, B, C, D):
    def met(self):
        s = super(Der, self)
        # get the superclass's bound-method object, or else None
        m = getattr(s, 'met', None)
        try:
            args, varargs, varkw, defaults = inspect.getargspec(m)
        except TypeError:
            # m is not a method, just ignore it
            pass
        else:
            # m is a method, do all its arguments have default values?
            if len(defaults) == len(args):
                # yes! so, call it:
                m( )
        print 'met in Der'</pre><br>


<p class="docText"><tt>inspect.getargspec</tt><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-6-ITERM-2226"></a> raises
a <tt>TypeError</tt> if its argument is not a method or
function, so we catch that case with a <tt>TRy/except</tt>
statement, and if the exception occurs, we just ignore it with a
do-nothing <tt>pass</tt> statement in the
<tt>except</tt> clause. To simplify our code a bit, we do
not first check separately with <tt>hasattr</tt>. Rather,
we get the '<tt>met</tt>' attribute of the superclass by
calling <tt>getattr</tt> with a third argument of
<tt>None</tt>. Thus, if the superclass does not have any
attribute named '<tt>met</tt>', <i>m</i> is set
to <tt>None</tt>, later causing exactly the same
<tt>TypeError</tt> that we have to catch (and ignore)
anywaytwo birds with one stone. If the call to
<tt>inspect.getargspec</tt> in the <tt>try</tt>
clause does not raise a <tt>TypeError</tt>, execution
continues with the <tt>else</tt> clause.</p>

<p class="docText">If <tt>inspect.getargspec</tt> doesn't
raise a <tt>TypeError</tt>, it returns a tuple of four
items, and we bind each item to a local name. In this case, the ones
we care about are <i>args</i>, a list of
<tt>m</tt>'s argument names, and
<I>defaults</i>, a tuple of default values that
<tt>m</tt> provides for its arguments. Clearly, we can call
<tt>m</tt> without arguments if and only if
<tt>m</tt> provides default values for all of its
arguments. So, we check that there are just as many default values as
arguments, by comparing the <tt>len</tt>gths of list
<I>args</i> and tuple <I>defaults</i>, and call
<tt>m</tt> only if the lengths are equal.</P>

<p class="docText">No doubt you don't need such advanced introspection
and such careful checking in most of the code you write, but, just in
case you do, Python does supply all the tools you need to achieve it.</P>
