<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-7-ITERM-2337"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-7-ITERM-2338"></a>You are using the standard
module <tt>shelve</tt>. Some of the values you have shelved
are mutable objects, and you need to mutate these objects.</P>


<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-7-SECT-7.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">The <tt>shelve</tt> module offers a kind of persistent
dictionaryan important niche between the power of
relational-database engines and the simplicity of
<tt>marshal</tt>, <tt>pickle</tt>,
<tt>dbm</tt>, and similar file formats. However, you should
be aware of a typical trap you need to avoid when using
<tt>shelve</tt>. Consider the following interactive Python
session:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import shelve
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Build a simple sample shelf
&gt;&gt;&gt; she = shelve.open('try.she', 'c')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for c in 'spam': she[c] = {c:23}
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; for c in she.keys( ): print c, she[c]
...
<B>p {'p': 23}</b>
<b>s {'s': 23}</b>
<B>a {'a': 23}</b>
<B>m {'m': 23}</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; she.close( )</pre><br>


<p class="docText">We've created the <tt>shelve</tt> file,
added some data to it, and closed it. Goodnow we can reopen it
and work with it:</P>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; she=shelve.open('try.she', 'c')
&gt;&gt;&gt; she['p']
<span class="docEmphBold">{'p': 23}</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; she['p']['p'] = 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; she['p']
<span class="docEmphBold">{'p': 23}</span></pre><BR>


<p class="docText">What's going on here? We just set the value to 42,
but our setting didn't <span class="docEmphasis">take</span> in
the <tt>shelve</tt> object! The problem is that we were
working with a temporary object that <tt>shelve</tt> gave
us, not with the "real thing".
<tt>shelve</tt>, when we open it with default options, like
here, doesn't track changes to such temporary
objects. One reasonable solution is to bind a name to this temporary
object, do our mutation, and then assign the mutated object back to
the appropriate item of <tt>shelve</tt>:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = she['p']
&gt;&gt;&gt; a['p'] = 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; she['p'] = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; she['p']
<span class="docEmphBold">{'p': 42}</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; she.close( )</pre><br>


<p class="docText">We can verify that the change was properly persisted:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; she=shelve.open('try.she','c')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for c in she.keys( ): print c,she[c]
...
<span class="docEmphBold">p {'p': 42}</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">s {'s': 23}</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">a {'a': 23}</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">m {'m': 23}</span></pre><br>


<p class="docText">A simpler solution is to open the <tt>shelve</tt> object
with the <tt>writeback</tt> option set to
<tt>TRue</tt>:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; she = shelve.open('try.she', 'c', writeback=True)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The <tt>writeback</tt> option instructs
<tt>shelve</tt> to keep track of all the objects it gets
from the file and write them all back to the file before closing it,
just in case they have been modified in the meantime. While simple,
this approach can be quite expensive, particularly in terms of memory
consumption. Specifically, if we read many objects from a
<tt>shelve</tt> object opened with
<tt>writeback=True</tt>, even if we only modify a few of
them, <tt>shelve</tt> is going to keep them
<span class="docEmphasis">all</span> in memory, since it can't
tell in advance which one we may be about to modify. The previous
approach, where we explicitly take responsibility to notify
<tt>shelve</tt> of any changes (by assigning the changed
objects back to the place they came from), requires more care on our
part, but repays that care by giving us much better performance.</P>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">The standard Python module <tt>shelve</tt> can be quite
convenient in many cases, but it hides a potentially nasty trap,
admittedly well documented in Python's online docs
but still easy to miss. Suppose you're shelving
mutable objects, such as dictionaries or lists. Naturally, you are
quite likely to want to mutate some of those objectsfor
example, by calling mutating methods (<tt>append</tt> on a
list, <tt>update</tt> on a dictionary, etc.) or by
assigning a new value to an item or attribute of the object. However,
when you do this, the change doesn't occur in the
<tt>shelve</tt> object. This is because we actually mutate
a temporary object that the <tt>shelve</tt> object has
given us as the result of
<tt>shelve</tt>'s own <tt>_ _getitem_
_</tt> method, but the <tt>shelve</tt> object, by
default, does not keep track of that temporary object, nor does it
care about it once it returns it to us.</p>

<p class="docText">As shown in the recipe, one solution is to bind a name to the
temporary object obtained by keying into the shelf, doing whatever
mutations are needed to the object via the name, then assigning the
newly mutated object back to the appropriate item of the
<tt>shelve</tt> object. When you assign to a
<tt>shelve</tt> object's item, the
<tt>shelve</tt> object's <tt>_
_setitem_ _</tt> method gets invoked, and it appropriately
updates the <tt>shelve</tt> object itself, so that the
change does occur.</P>

<p class="docText">Alternatively, you can add the flag <tt>writeback=True</tt>
at the time you open the <tt>shelve</tt> object, and then
<tt>shelve</tt> keeps track of every object it hands you,
saving them all back to disk at the end. This approach may save you
quite a bit of fussy and laborious coding, but take care: if you read
many items of the <tt>shelve</tt> object and only modify a
few of them, the <tt>writeback</tt> approach can be
exceedingly costly, particularly in terms of memory consumption. When
opened with <tt>writeback=True</tt>,
<tt>shelve</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">will</span> keep in memory
any item it has ever handed you, and save them all to disk at the
end, since it doesn't have a reliable way to tell
which items you may be about to modify, nor, in general, even which
items you <span class="docEmphasis">have</span> actually modified by the time you
<tt>close</tt> the <tt>shelve</tt> object. The
recommended approach, unless you're going to modify
just about every item you read (or unless the
<tt>shelve</tt> object in question is small enough compared
with your available memory that you don't really
care), is the previous one: bind a name to the items that you get
from a <tt>shelve</tt> object with intent to modify them,
and assign each item back into the <tt>shelve</tt> object
once you're done mutating that item.</P>
