<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText">Most Win32 applications must process messages, but you often want to
wait on kernel waitables and coordinate a lot of things going on at
the same time. A good message pump structure is the key to this, and
this recipe exemplifies a reasonably simple but pretty effective one.</P>

<p class="docText">With the message pump shown in this recipe, messages and other events
get dispatched as soon as they are posted, and a timeout allows you
to poll other components. You may need to poll if the proper calls or
event objects are not exposed in your Win32 event loop, as many
components insist on running only on the
application's main thread and cannot run on spawned
(secondary) threads.</P>

<p class="docText">You can add many other refinements, just as you can to any other
Win32 message-pump approach. Python lets you do this with as much
precision as C does, thanks to Mark Hammond's
<tt>PyWin32</tt> package (which used to be known as
<tt>win32all</tt>). However, the relatively simple message
pump presented in this recipe is already a big step up from the
typical naive application that can either serve its message loop or
wait on kernel waitables, but not both.</p>

<p class="docText">The key to this recipe is the Windows API call
<tt>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</tt>, which takes several
parameters. The first is a tuple of kernel objects you want to wait
for. The second parameter is a flag that is normally 0. The value 1
indicates that you should wait until <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> the
kernel objects in the first parameter are signaled, but my experience
suggests that you almost invariably want to stop waiting when any
<span class="docEmphasis">one</span> of these objects is signaled, so this
parameter will almost always be 0. The third is a flag that specifies
which Windows messages you want to interrupt the wait; always pass
<tt>win32event.QS_ALLEVENTS</tt> here, to make sure any
Windows message interrupts the wait. The fourth parameter is a
timeout period (in milliseconds), or
<tt>win32event.INFINITE</tt> if you are sure you do not
need to do any periodic polling.</p>

<p class="docText">This function is a polling loop and, sure enough, it loops (with a
<tt>while True</tt>, which is terminated only by a
<tt>break</tt> within it). At each leg of the loop, it
calls the API that waits for multiple objects. When that API stops
waiting, it returns a code that explains why it stopped waiting. A
value between <tt>win32event.WAIT_OBJECT_0</tt> and
<tt>win32event.WAIT_OBJECT_0+N-1</tt> (where
<tt><i>N</i></tt> is the number of waitable kernel objects
in the tuple you passed as the first parameter), inclusive, means
that the wait finished because an object was signaled (being signaled
means different things for each kind of waitable kernel object). The
return code's difference from
<tt>win32event.WAIT_OBJECT_0</tt> is the index of the
relevant object in the tuple.</P>

<p class="docText">A return value of <tt>win32event.WAIT_OBJECT_0+N</tt> means
that the wait finished because a message was pending, and in this
case, our recipe processes all pending Windows messages via a call to
<tt>pythoncom.PumpWaitingMessages</tt>. (That function, in
turn, returns a true result if a <tt>WM_QUIT</tt> message
was received, so in this case, we <tt>break</tt> out of the
whole <tt>while</tt> loop.) A code of
<tt>win32event.WAIT_TIMEOUT</tt> means the wait finished
because of a timeout, so we can do our polling there. In this case,
no message is waiting, and none of our kernel objects of interest
were signaled.</p>

<p class="docText">Basically, the way to tune this recipe for yourself is by using the
right kernel objects as <span class="docEmphasis">waitables</span> (with an
appropriate response to each) and by doing whatever you need to do
periodically in the polling case. While this means you must have some
detailed understanding of Win32, of course, it's
still quite a bit easier than designing your own special-purpose,
message-loop function from scratch.</p>

<p class="docText">I suspect that a purist would find some way or other to wrap all of
this message pumping into a neat module, letting each application
customize its use of the module by passing in a list of waitables,
some dictionary to map different waitables to chunks of code to
execute, and a partridge in a pear tree. Go ahead, turn it all into a
custom metaclass if you wish, see if I care. For once, though, I
think the right approach to reusing this code is to copy it into your
application's source directories, and use your
trusty <span class="docEmphasis">text editor</span> (gasp!) to tailor the message
pump to your application's exact needs.</P>
