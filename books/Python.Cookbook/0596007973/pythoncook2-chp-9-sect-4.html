<tt>Queue.Queue</tt> type is the simplest and most
effective way to coordinate a pool of worker threads. We could group
all the needed data structures and functions into a class, but
there's no real need to. So, here they are, shown as
globals instead:</p>

        in the Queue Q, without any waiting

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">It is generally a mistake to architect a multithreading program on
the premise of having it spawn arbitrarily high numbers of threads as
needed. Most often, the best architecture for such a program is based
on farming out work to a fixed and relatively small number of
<I>worker threads</i>an arrangement known as a
<I>thread pool</I>. This recipe shows a very simple
example of a thread pool, focusing on the use of
<tt>Queue.Queue</tt> instances as the most useful and
simplest way for inter-thread communication and synchronization.</p>

<p class="docText">In this recipe, worker threads run function
<i>do_work_from_queue</i>, which has the right structure
for a typical worker thread but does really minimal
"processing" (just as an example).
In this case, the worker thread computes a
"result" by prepending the string
'<tt>new</tt>' to each arriving item (note that this
implicitly assumes that arriving items are strings). In your
applications, of course, you will have, in the equivalent of this
<i>do_work_from_queue</I> function, more substantial
processing, and quite possibly different kinds of processing
depending on the value of the <i>command</i> parameter.</P>

<p class="docText">In addition to the worker threads in the pool, a multithreading
program often has other specialized threads for various purposes,
such as interfacing to various entities external to the program (a
GUI, a database, a library that is not guaranteed to be thread-safe).
In this recipe, such specialized threads are not shown. However, it
does include at least a "main
thread", which starts and stops the thread pool,
determines the units of work to be farmed out, and eventually gathers
all results and any errors that may have been reported.</p>

<p class="docText">In your applications, you may or may not want to start and stop the
thread pool repeatedly. Most typically, you may start the pool as a
part of your program's initialization, leave it
running throughout, and stop it, if at all, only as a part of your
program's final cleanup. If you set your worker
threads as "daemons", as this
recipe's function
<I>make_and_start_thread_pool</i> sets them by default, it
means that your program will not continue running when only worker
threads are left. Rather, your program will terminate as soon as the
main thread terminates. Again, this arrangement is a typically
advisable architecture. At any rate, the recipe also provides a
function <I>stop_and_free_thread_pool</I>, just in case you
<span class="docEmphasis">do</span> want to terminate and clean up your thread
pool at some point (and possibly later make and restart another one
with another call to <i>make_and_start_thread_pool</i>).</p>

<p class="docText">An example use of the functionality in this recipe might be:</p>

<pre>for i in ('_ba', '_be', '_bo'): request_work(i)
make_and_start_thread_pool( )
stop_and_free_thread_pool( )
show_all_results( )
show_all_errors( )</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The output from this snippet should normally be:</p>

<pre>Result: new_ba
Result: new_be
Result: new_bo</pre><br>


<p class="docText">although it's <span class="docEmphasis">possible</span> (but
quite unlikely) that two of the results might end up exchanged. (If
ordering of results is important to you, be sure to add a progressive
number to the work requests you post from the main thread, and report
it back to the main thread as part of each result or error.)</p>

<p class="docText">Here is a case where an error occurs and gets reported:</p>

<pre>for i in ('_ba', 7, '_bo'): request_work(i)
make_and_start_thread_pool( )
stop_and_free_thread_pool( )
show_all_results( )
show_all_errors( )</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The output from this snippet should normally be (net of an extremely
unlikely, but not impossible, exchange between the two
"Result" lines):</p>

<pre>Result: new_ba
Result: new_bo
Error: exceptions.TypeError cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The worker thread that gets the item <tt>7</tt> reports a
<tt>TypeError</tt> because it tries to concatenate the
string '<tt>new</tt>' with this item, which is an
<tt>int</tt>an invalid operation. Not to worry: we
have the <tt>try</tt>/<tt>except</tt> statement
in function <I>do_work_from_queue</I> exactly to catch any
kind of error, and <tt>Queue</tt> <i>Qerr</i> and
functions <I>report_error</i> and
<i>show_all_errors</i> exactly to ensure that errors do not
pass silently, unless explicitly silenced, which is a key point of
Python's general approach to programming.</p>
