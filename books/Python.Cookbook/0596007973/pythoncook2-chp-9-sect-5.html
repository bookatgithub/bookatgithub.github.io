<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2540"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2541"></a>You want to execute a function
simultaneously over multiple sets of arguments. (Presumably the
function is "I/O bound", meaning it
spends substantial time doing input/output operations; otherwise,
simultaneous execution would be useless.)</P>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">Use one thread for each set of arguments. For good performance,
it's best to limit our use of threads to a bounded
pool:</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</H4>

<p class="docText">This recipe's <I>MultiThread</i> class
offers a simple way to execute a function in parallel, on many sets
of arguments, using a bounded pool of threads. Optionally, you can
ask for results of the calls to the function to be queued, so you can
retrieve them, but by default the results are just thrown away.</P>

<p class="docText">The <I>MultiThread</i> class takes as its arguments a
function, a sequence of argument tuples for said function, and
optionally a boundary on the number of threads to use in its pool and
an indicator that results should be queued. Beyond the constructor,
it exposes three methods: <i>start</i>, to start all the
threads in the pool and begin the parallel evaluation of the function
over all argument tuples; <i>join</I>, to perform a join on
all threads in the pool (meaning to wait for all the threads in the
pool to have terminated); and <i>get</i>, to get queued
results (if it was instantiated with the optional flag
<I>queue_results</i> set to <tt>TRue</tt>, to ask
for results to be queued). Internally, class
<i>MultiThread</I> uses its private method
<I>doSome</i> as the target callable for all threads in the
pool. Each thread works on the next available tuple of arguments
(supplied by the <tt>next</tt> method of an iterator on the
iterable whose items are such tuples, with the call to
<tt>next</tt> being guarded by the usual locking idiom),
until all work has been completed.</p>

<p class="docText">As is usual in Python, the module can also be run as a free-standing
main script, in which case it runs a simple demonstration and
self-test. In this case, the demonstration simulates a class of
schoolchildren reciting multiplication tables as fast as they can.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2542"></a>Real use cases for this recipe mostly
involve functions that are I/O bound, meaning functions that spend
substantial time performing I/O. If a function is
"CPU bound", meaning the function
spends its time using the CPU, you get better overall performance by
performing the computations one after the other, rather than in
parallel. In Python, this observation tends to hold even on machines
that dedicate multiple CPUs to your program, because Python uses a
GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), so that pure Python code from a single
process does not run simultaneously on more than one CPU at a time.</p>

<p class="docText">Input/output operations release the GIL, and so can (and should) any
C-coded Python extension that performs substantial computations
without callbacks into Python. So, it <span class="docEmphasis">is</span>
possible that parallel execution may speed up your program, but only
if either I/O or a suitable C-coded extension is involved, rather
than pure computationally intensive Python code. (Implementations of
Python on different virtual machines, such as Jython, which runs on a
JVM [Java Virtual Machine], or IronPython, which runs on the
Microsoft .NET runtime, are of course not bound by these
observations: these observations apply only to the widespread
"classical Python", meaning
CPython, implementation.)<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2543"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2544"></a></p>
