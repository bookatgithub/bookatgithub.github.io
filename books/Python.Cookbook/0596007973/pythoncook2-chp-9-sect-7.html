<h4 class="docSection2Title">Problem</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2553"></a>You need to allocate to

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Solution</H4>

<p class="docText">Thread-specific storage is a useful design pattern, and Python 2.3
did not yet support it directly. However, even in 2.3, we could code
it up in terms of a dictionary protected by a lock. For once,
it's slightly more general, and not significantly
harder, to program to the lower-level <tt>thread</tt>
module, rather than to the more commonly useful, higher-level
<tt>tHReading</tt> module that Python offers on top of it:</p>

<pre>_tss = {  }
try:
    import thread
except ImportError:
    # We're running on a single-threaded platform (or, at least, the Python
    # interpreter has not been compiled to support threads), so we just return
    # the same dict for every call -- there's only one thread around anyway!
    def get_thread_storage( ):
        return _tss
else:
    # We do have threads; so, to work:
    _tss_lock = thread.allocate_lock( )
    def get_thread_storage( ):
        """ Return a thread-specific storage dictionary. """
        thread_id = thread.get_ident( )
        _tss_lock.acquire( )
        try:
            return _tss.set_default(thread_id, {  })
        finally:
            _tss_lock.release( )</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Python 2.4 offers a much simpler and faster implementation, of
course, thanks to the new <tt>tHReading.local</tt>
function:</p>

<pre>try:
    import threading
except ImportError:
    import dummy_threading as threading
_tss = threading.local( )
def get_thread_storage( ):
    return _tss._ _dict_ _</pre><BR>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">Discussion</h4>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2554"></a>The main benefit of multithreaded programs
is that all of the threads can share global objects when they need to
do so. Often, however, each thread also needs some storage of its
ownfor example, to store a network or database connection
unique to itself. Indeed, each such externally oriented object is
generally best kept under the control of a single thread, to avoid
multiple possibilities of highly peculiar behavior, race conditions,
and so on. The <i>get_thread_storage</i> function in this
recipe solves this problem by implementing the
"thread-specific storage" design
pattern, and specifically by returning a thread-specific storage
dictionary. The calling thread can then use the returned dictionary
to store any kind of data that is private to the thread. This recipe
is, in a sense, a generalization of the
<tt>get_transaction</tt> function from ZODB, the
object-oriented database underlying Zope.</P>

<p class="docText">One possible extension to this recipe is to add a
<i>delete_thread_storage</i> function. Such a function
would be useful, particularly if a way could be found to automate its
being called upon thread termination. Python's
threading architecture does not make this task particularly easy. You
could spawn a watcher thread to do the deletion after a join with the
calling thread, but that's a rather heavyweight
approach. The recipe as presented, without deletion, is quite
appropriate for the common and recommended architecture in which you
have a pool of (typically daemonic) worker threads (perhaps some of
them general workers, with others dedicated to interfacing to
specific external resources) that are spawned at the start of the
program and do not go away until the end of the whole process.</P>

<p class="docText"><a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2555"></a> <a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2556"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2557"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2558"></a>
<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2559"></a>When
multithreading is involved, implementation must always be
particularly careful to detect and prevent race conditions,
deadlocks, and other such conflicts. In this recipe, I have decided
not to assume that a dictionary's
<tt>set_default</tt> method is
<i>atomic</I> (meaning that no thread switch can
occur while <tt>set_default</tt> executes)adding a
key can potentially change the dictionary's whole
structure, after all. If I was willing to make such an assumption, I
could do away with the lock and vastly increase performance, but I
suspect that such an assumption might make the code too fragile and
dependent on specific versions of Python. (It seems to me that the
assumption holds for Python 2.3, but, even if that is the case, I
want my applications to survive subtle future changes to
Python's internals.) Another risk is that, if a
thread terminates and a new one starts, the new thread might end up
with the same thread ID as the just-terminated one, and therefore
accidentally share the "thread-specific
storage" dictionary left behind by the
just-terminated thread. This risk might be mitigated (though not
eliminated) by providing the <i>delete_thread_storage</I>
function mentioned in the previous paragraph. Again, this specific
problem does not apply to me, given the kind of multithreading
architecture that I use in my applications. If your architecture
differs, you may want to modify this recipe's
solution accordingly.</P>

<p class="docText">If the performance of this recipe's version is
insufficient for your application's needs, due to
excessive overhead in acquiring and releasing the lock, then, rather
than just removing the lock at the risk of making your application
fragile, you might consider an alternative:</p>

<pre>_creating_threads = True
_tss_lock = thread.allocate_lock( )
_tss = {  }
class TssSequencingError(RuntimeError): pass
def done_creating_threads( ):
    """ switch from thread-creation to no-more-threads-created state """
    global _creating_threads
    if not _creating_threads:
        raise TssSequencingError('done_creating_threads called twice')
    _creating_threads = False
def get_thread_storage( ):
    """ Return a thread-specific storage dictionary. """
    thread_id = thread.get_ident( )
    # fast approach if thread-creation phase is finished
    if not _creating_threads: return _tss[thread_id]
    # careful approach if we're still creating threads
    try:
        _tss_lock.acquire( )
        return _tss.setdefault(thread_id, {  })
    finally:
        _tss_lock.release( )</pre><br>


<p class="docText">This variant adds a boolean switch
<i>_creating_threads</i>, initially
<tt>true</tt>. As long as the switch is
<tt>true</tt>, the variant uses a careful locking-based
approach, quite similar to the one presented in this
recipe's Solution. At some point in time, when all
threads that will ever exist (or at least all that will ever require
access to <i>get_thread_storage</i>) have been started, and
each of them has obtained its thread-local storage dictionary, your
application calls <i>done_creating_threads</i>. This sets
<i>_creating_threads</i> to <tt>False</tt>, and
every future call to <i>get_thread_storage</I> then takes a
fast path where it simply indexes into global dictionary
<I>_tss</i>no more acquiring and releasing the lock,
no more creating a thread's thread-local storage
dictionary if it didn't yet exist.</p>

<p class="docText">As long as your application can determine a moment in which it can
truthfully call <I>done_creating_threads</i>, the variant
in this subsection should definitely afford a substantial increase in
speed compared to this recipe's Solution. Note that
it is particularly likely that you can use this variant if your
application follows the popular and recommended architecture
mentioned previously: a bounded set of daemonic, long-lived worker
threads, all created early in your program. This is fortunate,
because, if your application is performance-sensitive enough to worry
about the locking overhead of this recipe's
solution, then no doubt you will want to structure your application
that way. The alternative approach of having many short-lived threads
is generally quite damaging to performance.</p>

<p class="docText">If your application needs to run only under Python 2.4, you can get a
much simpler, faster, and solid implementation by relying on the new
<tt>threading.local</tt> function.
<tt>threading.local</tt> returns a new object on which any
thread can get and set arbitrary attributes, independently from
whatever getting and setting other threads may be doing on the same
object. This recipe, in the 2.4 variant, returns the per-thread
<tt>_ _dict_ _</tt> of such an object, for uniformity with
the 2.3 variant. This way, your applications can be made to run on
both Python 2.3 and 2.4, using the best version in each case:</p>

<pre>import sys
if sys.version &gt;= '2.4':
<i> # insert 2.4 definition of get_local_storage here</I>
else:
<i> # insert 2.3 definition of get_local_storage here</I></pre><br>


<p class="docText">The 2.4 variant of this recipe also shows off the intended use of
module <tt>dummy_threading</tt>, which, like its sibling
<tt>dummy_thread</tt>, is also available in Python 2.3. By
conditionally using these dummy modules, which are available on all
platforms, whether or not Python was compiled with thread support,
you may sometimes, with due care, be able to write applications that
can run on any platform, taking advantage of threading where
it's available but running anyway even where
threading is not available. In the 2.3 variant, we did not use the
similar approach based on <tt>dummy_thread</tt>, because
the overhead would be too high to pay on nonthreaded platforms; in
the 2.4 variant, overhead is pretty low anyway, so we went for the
simplicity that <tt>dummy_threading</tt> affords.<a name="pythoncook2-CHP-9-ITERM-2560"></a></P>
