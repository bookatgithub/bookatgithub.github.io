<h3 class="docSection1Title">Audience</h3>

<p class="docText">We expect that you know at least some Python. This book does not
attempt to teach Python as a whole; rather, it presents some specific
techniques and concepts (and occasionally tricks) for dealing with
particular tasks. If you are looking for an introduction to Python,
consider some of the books described in the <a class="docLink" href="pythoncook2-PREFACE-2-SECT-6.html#pythoncook2-PREFACE-2-SECT-6">Further Reading</a> section of this Preface.
However, you don't need to know a lot of Python to
find this book helpful. Chapters include recipes demonstrating the
best techniques for accomplishing some elementary and general tasks,
as well as more complex or specialized ones. We have also added
sidebars, here and there, to clarify certain concepts which are used
in the book and which you may have heard of, but which might still be
unclear to you. However, this is definitely not a book
<span class="docEmphasis">just</span> for beginners. The main target audience is
the whole Python community, mostly made up of pretty good
programmers, neither newbies nor wizards. And if you
<span class="docEmphasis">do</span> already know a lot about Python, you may be
in for a pleasant surprise! We've included recipes
that explore some the newest and least well-known areas of Python.
You might very well learn a few thingswe did! Regardless of
where you fall along the spectrum of Python expertise, and more
generally of programming skill, we believe you will get something
valuable from this book.</p>

<p class="docText">If you already own the first edition, you may be wondering whether
you need this second edition, too. We think the answer is
"yes." The first edition had 245
recipes; we kept 146 of those (with lots of editing in almost all
cases), and added 192 new ones, for a total of 338 recipes in this
second edition. So, over half of the recipes in this edition are
completely new, and all the recipes are updated to apply to
today's Pythonreleases 2.3 and 2.4. Indeed,
this update is the main factor which lets us have almost 100 more
recipes in a book of about the same size. The first edition covered
all versions from 1.5.2 (and sometimes earlier) to 2.2; this one
focuses firmly on 2.3 and 2.4. Thanks to the greater power of
today's Python, and, even more, thanks to the fact
that this edition avoids the
"historical" treatises about how
you had to do things in Python versions released 5 or more years ago,
we were able to provide substantially more currently relevant recipes
and information in roughly the same amount of space.</p>
