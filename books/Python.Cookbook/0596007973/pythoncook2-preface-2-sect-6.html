<p class="docText">There are many texts available to help you learn Python or refine
your Python knowledge, from introductory texts all the way to quite
formal language descriptions.</p>

<p class="docText">We recommend the following books for general information about Python
(all these books cover at least Python 2.2, unless otherwise noted):</p>

<ul><LI><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner</span>, by
Michael Dawson (Thomson Course Technology), is a hands-on, highly
accessible introduction to Python for people who have never
programmed.</p></LI><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Learning Python</span>, by Mark Lutz and David Ascher
(O'Reilly), is a thorough introduction to the
fundamentals of Python.</P></li><LI><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Practical Python</span>, by Magnus Lie Hetland
(APress), is an introduction to Python which also develops, in
detail, ten fully worked out, substantial programs in many different
areas.</P></li><LI><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Dive into Python</span>, by Mark Pilgrim (APress), is a
fast-paced introduction to Python for experienced programmers, and it
is also freely available for online reading and downloading
(<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://diveintopython.org/">http://diveintopython.org/</a>).</P></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Python Standard Library</span>, by Fredrik Lundh
(O'Reilly), provides a use case for each module in
the rich library that comes with every standard Python distribution
(in the current first edition, the book only covers Python up to
2.0).</p></li><LI><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Programming Python</span>, by Mark Lutz
(O'Reilly), is a thorough rundown of Python
programming techniques (in the current second edition, the book only
covers Python up to 2.0).</p></li><LI><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Python Essential Reference</span>, by David Beazley
(New Riders), is a quick reference that focuses on the Python
language and the core Python libraries (in the current second
edition, the book only covers Python up to 2.1).</p></LI><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Python in a Nutshell</span>, by Alex Martelli
(O'Reilly), is a comprehensive quick reference to
the Python language and the key libraries used by most Python
programmers.</P></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">In addition, several more special-purpose books can help you explore
particular aspects of Python programming. Which books you will like
best depends a lot on your areas of interest. From personal
experience, the editors can recommend at least the following:</p>

<ul><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Python and XML</span>, by Christopher A. Jones and Fred
L. Drake, Jr. (O'Reilly), offers thorough coverage
of using Python to read, process, and transform XML.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Jython Essentials</span>, by Samuele Pedroni and Noel
Rappin (O'Reilly), is the authoritative book on
Jython, the port of Python to the JVM. Particularly useful if you
already know some (or a lot of) Java.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Game Programming with Python</span>, by Sean Riley
(Charles River Media), covers programming computer games with Python,
all the way from advanced graphics to moderate amounts of
"artificial intelligence."</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Python Web Programming</span>, by Steve Holden (New
Riders), covers building networked systems using Python, with
introductions to many other related technologies (databases, HTTP,
HTML, etc.). Very suitable for readers with none to medium experience
with these fields, but has something to teach everyone.</P></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">In addition to these books, other important sources of information
can help explain some of the code in the recipes in this book.
We've pointed out the information that seemed
particularly relevant in the "See
Also" sections of each recipe. In these sections, we
often refer to the standard Python documentation: most often the
<span class="docEmphasis">Library Reference</span>, sometimes the
<span class="docEmphasis">Reference Manual</span>, and occasionally the
<span class="docEmphasis">Tutorial</span>. This documentation is freely available
in a variety of forms:</p>

<UL><li><p class="docList">On the <span class="docEmphasis">python.org</span> web site (at <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/doc/">http://www.python.org/doc/</a>), which always
contains the most up-to-date documentation about Python.</p></li><li><p class="docList">On the <span class="docEmphasis">pydoc.org</span> web site (at <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://pydoc.org/">http://pydoc.org/</a>), accompanied by
module-by-module documentation of the standard library automatically
generated by the very useful <i>pydoc</i> tool.</P></li><LI><p class="docList">In Python itself. Recent versions of Python boast a nice online help
system, which is worth exploring if you've never
used it. Just type <tt>help( )</tt> at the interactive
Python interpreter prompt to start exploring.</p></LI><li><p class="docList">As part of the online help in your Python installation.
ActivePython's installer, for example, includes a
searchable Windows help file. The standard Python distribution
currently includes HTML pages, but there are plans to include a
similar Windows Help file in future releases.</P></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">We have not included specific section numbers in our references to
the standard Python documentation, since the organization of these
manuals can change from release to release. You should be able to use
the table of contents and indexes to find the relevant material. For
the <span class="docEmphasis">Library Reference</span>, in particular, the Module
Index (an alphabetical list of all standard library modules, each
module name being a hyperlink to the <span class="docEmphasis">Library
Reference</span> documentation for that module) is invaluable.
Similarly, we have not given specific pointers in our references to
<span class="docEmphasis">Python in a Nutshell</span>: that book is still in its
first edition (covering Python up to 2.2) at the time of this
writing, but by the time you're reading, a second
edition (covering Python 2.3 and 2.4) is likely to be forthcoming, if
not already published.</P>
