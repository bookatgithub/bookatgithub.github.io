<h3 class="docSection1Title">Conventions Used in This Book</h3>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Pronouns</span>: the first person singular is meant to
convey that the recipe's or chapter
introduction's author is speaking (when multiple
credits are given for a recipe, the author is the first person
credited); however, even such remarks have at times had to be edited
enough that they may not reflect the original
author's intended meaning (we, the editors, tried
hard to avoid that, but we know we must have failed in some cases,
since there were so many remarks, and authorial intent was often not
entirely clear). The second person is meant to refer to you, the
reader. The first person plural collectively indicates you, the
reader, plus the recipe's author and co-authors, the
editors, and my friend Joe (hi Joe!)in other words,
it's a very inclusive
"we" or
"us."</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Code</span>: each block of code may indicate a complete
module or script (or, often, a Python source file that is usable both
as a script and as a module), an isolated snippet from some
hypothetical module or script, or part of a Python interactive
interpreter session (indicated by the prompt 
<tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt>).</p>

<p class="docText">The following typographical conventions are used throughout this book:</p>

<p class="docText"><I>Italic</i> for commands, filenames, for emphasis,
and for first use of a term.</P>

<p class="docText"><tt>Constant width</tt> for general code fragments and
keywords (mostly Python ones, but also other languages, such as C or
HTML, where they occur). <tt>Constant width is also used for</tt>
all names defined in Python's library and
third-party modules.</p>

<p class="docText"><tt><B>Constant width bold</b></tt> is used to emphasize
particular lines within code listings and show output that is
produced.</p>
