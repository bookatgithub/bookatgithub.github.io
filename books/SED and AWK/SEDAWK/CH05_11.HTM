>The read (<KBD

commands allow you to work directly with files.  Both take a single
argument, the name of a file.  The syntax follows:</P

>The read command reads the contents of <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>file</EM
> into
the pattern space after the addressed line.  It cannot operate on a
range of lines.  The write command writes the contents of the pattern
space to the <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>file</EM
>.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>You must have a single space between the command and the filename.
(Everything after that space and up to the newline is taken to be the
filename.  Thus, leading or embedded spaces will become part of
the filename.)  The read command will not complain if the file does
not exist.  The write command will create a file if it does not exist;
if the file already exists, the write command will overwrite it each
time the script is invoked.  If there are multiple instructions
writing to the same file in one script, then each write command
appends to the file.  Also, be aware that you can only open up to 10
files per script.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The read command can be useful for inserting the contents of one file
at a particular place in another file.  For instance, let's say that
there is a set of files and each file should close with the same one-
or two-paragraph statement.  A sed script would allow you to maintain
the closing separately while inserting it as needed, for instance,
when sending the file to the printer.</P
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="screen"
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>sed '$r closing' $* | pr | lp</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
CLASS="para"
>The $ is an addressing symbol specifying the last line of the file.
The contents of the file named <I
CLASS="filename"
>closing</I
> are placed
after the contents of pattern space and output with it.  This example
does not specify a pathname, assuming the file to be in the same
directory as the command.  A more general-purpose command should use
the full pathname.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>You may want to test out a few quirks of the read command.  Let's look
at the following command:</P
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="screen"
><PRE

>/^&lt;Company-list&gt;/r company.list</PRE

><P
CLASS="para"

&quot;&lt;Company-list&gt;&quot;, it is going to append the contents of the file
<EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>company.list</EM
> to the end of the matched line.  No
subsequent command will affect the lines read from the file.  For
instance, you can't make any changes to the list of companies that
you've read into the file.  However, commands that address the
original line will work.  The previous command could be
followed by a second command:</P

>Now let's look at examples of the write command.  One use is to
extract information from one file and place it in its own file.
For instance, imagine that we had a file listing the names of
salespeople alphabetically.   For each person, the listing designates
which of four regions the person is assigned to.  Here's a sample:</P
><BLOCKQUOTE

Jeffries, Jane          West
Madison, Sylvia         Midwest

></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
CLASS="para"
>Writing a script for a seven-line file, of course, is ridiculous.
Yet such a script can potentially handle as many names as you
can put together, and is reusable.  </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>If all we wanted was to extract the names for a particular region,
we could easily use <KBD
CLASS="command"
>grep</KBD
> to do it.  The advantage with
sed is that we can break up the file into four separate files
in a single step.  The following four-line script does it:</P
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="screen"
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>/Northeast$/w region.northeast
/South$/w region.south
/Midwest$/w region.midwest
/West$/w region.west</PRE

CLASS="para"
>All of the names of salespeople that are assigned to the Northeast region will
be placed in a file named <I
CLASS="filename"
>region.northeast</I
>.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The write command writes out the contents of the pattern space when
the command is invoked, not when end of the script is reached.  In the
previous example, we might want to remove the name of the region
before writing it to file.  For each case, we could handle it as we
show for the Northeast region:</P

>Like many programs, a sed script often starts out small, and is simple
to write and simple to read.  In testing the script, you may discover
specific cases for which the general rules do not apply.  To account
for these, you add lines to your script, making it longer, more
complex, and more complete.  While the amount of time you spend
refining your script may cancel out the time saved by not doing the editing
manually, at least during that time your mind has been engaged by your
own seeming sleight-of-hand: &quot;See!  The computer did it.&quot;</P

>We encountered one such problem in preparing a formatted copy of
command pages that the writer had typed as a text file without any
formatting information.  Although the files had no formatting codes,
headings were used consistently to identify the format of the command

>******************************************************************

NAME:	DBclose - closes a database

SYNTAX:
	void	DBclose(fdesc)
		DBFILE *fdesc;

USAGE:
	fdesc	- pointer to database file descriptor

DESC: 
DBclose() closes a file when given its database file descriptor.  
Your pending writes to that file will be completed before the
file is closed.  All of your update locks are removed. 
*fdesc becomes invalid.

Other users are not affected when you call DBclose().  Their update
locks and pending writes are not changed.

Note that there is no default file as there is in BASIC.  
*fdesc must specify an open file.

DBclose() is analogous to the CLOSE statement in BASIC.

RETURNS:
	There is no return value

reference header macros we had developed.  Because there were perhaps
forty of these command pages, it would have been utter drudgery to go
through and add codes by hand.  However, because there were that many,
and even though the writer was generally consistent in entering them,
there would be enough differences from command to command to have
required several passes.</P

this is a process of looking carefully at each line of a sample input
file and determining whether or not an edit must be made on that line.

to find specific patterns that mark the lines or range of lines that
need editing.</P

>This command deletes entire lines of asterisks anywhere they occur in
the file.  We saw that blank lines were used to separate paragraphs,
but replacing every blank line with a paragraph macro would cause
other problems.  In many cases, the blank lines can be removed because
spacing has been provided in the macro.  This is a case where we put
off deleting or replacing blank lines on a global basis until we have
dealt with specific cases.  For instance, some blank lines separate
labeled sections, and we can use them to define the end of a range of
lines.  The script, then, is designed to delete unwanted blank lines
as the last operation.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Tabs were a similar problem.  Tabs were used to indent syntax lines
and in some cases after the colon following a label, such as &quot;NAME&quot;.
Our first thought was to remove all tabs by replacing them with eight
spaces, but there were tabs we wanted to keep, such as those
inside the syntax line.  So we removed only specific cases, tabs at
the beginning of lines and tabs following a colon.</P

were other problems when we used a larger sample.  The writer was
inconsistent in his use of the &quot;DESC&quot; label.  Mostly, it occurred on a
line by itself; sometimes, though, it was included at the start of the
second paragraph.  So we had to add another pattern to deal with this
case.  It searches for the label followed by a space and one or more

It is best to redirect the output of sed to another file or let it go

the original file than to write a new script to correct the problems
