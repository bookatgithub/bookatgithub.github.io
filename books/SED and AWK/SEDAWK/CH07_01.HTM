>The original awk was a nice little language. It first saw the light
of day with Version 7 UNIX, around 1978.  It caught on, and people
used it for significant programming.</P

CLASS="para"
>In 1985, the original authors, seeing that awk was being used for
more serious programming than they had ever intended, decided to
beef up the language.  (See <A
CLASS="xref"
HREF="ch11_01.htm"
TITLE="A Flock of awks"
>Chapter 11, A Flock of awks</A
>, for
a description of the original awk, and all the things it did not
have when compared to the new one.)
The new version was finally released to the world at large in 1987,
and it is this version that is still found on SunOS 4.1.x systems.</P

CLASS="para"
>In 1989, for System V Release 4, awk was updated in some minor
ways.[1]
This version became the basis for the awk feature list in the POSIX
standard.  POSIX clarified a number of things about awk, and added the

CLASS="command"
>CONVFMT</KBD

>To write an awk script, you must become familiar with the rules of the
game.  The rules can be stated plainly and you will find them
described in <A
CLASS="xref"
HREF="appb_01.htm"
TITLE="Quick Reference for awk"
>Appendix B, Quick Reference for awk</A
>, rather than in this
chapter.  The goal of this chapter is not to describe the rules but to
show you how to play the game.  In this way, you will become
acquainted with many of the features of the language and see examples
that illustrate how scripts actually work.  Some people prefer to
begin by reading the rules, which is roughly equivalent to learning to
use a program from its manual page or learning to speak a language by
scanning its rules of grammar&nbsp;- not an easy task.  Having a good
grasp of the rules, however, is essential once you begin to use awk
regularly.  But the more you use awk, the faster the rules of the game
become second nature.  You learn them through trial and
error&nbsp;- spending a long time trying to fix a silly syntax error
such as a missing space or brace has a magical effect upon long-term
memory.  Thus, the best way to learn to write scripts is to begin
writing them.  As you make progress writing scripts, you will no doubt
benefit from reading the rules (and rereading them) in 
<A

HREF="appb_01.htm"
TITLE="Quick Reference for awk"

later&nbsp;- let's get started now.</P
