>With user-defined functions, awk
allows the novice programmer to take another step toward
C programming[3]
by writing programs that make use
of self-contained functions.  
When you write a function properly, you have
defined a program component that can be
reused in other programs.
The real benefit of modularity becomes apparent
as programs grow in size or in age, and as the number 
of programs you write increases significantly.  </P

>It is important to understand the notion of local and global
variables.  A local variable is a variable that is local
to a function and cannot be accessed outside of it.  A global
variable, on the other hand, can be accessed or changed anywhere
in the script.  There can be potentially damaging side effects
of global variables if a function changes a variable that 
is used elsewhere in the script.  Therefore, it is usually a good
idea to eliminate global variables in a function.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>When we call the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>insert()</KBD
> function, and specify $1 as
the first argument, then a copy of that variable is passed to
the function, where it is manipulated as a local variable
named <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>STRING</B
>.
All the variables in the function definition's parameter list 
are local variables
and their values are not accessible outside the function.
Similarly, the arguments in the function call
are not changed by the function itself.
When the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>insert()</KBD
> function returns, the value of $1 is not changed.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>However, the variables defined in the body of the function
are global variables, by default.  Given the above definition
of the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>insert()</KBD
> function, the temporary variables <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>before_tmp</B
>
and <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>after_tmp</B
> are visible outside the function.  Awk provides
what its developers call an &quot;inelegant&quot; means of declaring variables
local to a function, and that is by specifying those variables in
the parameter list.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
><A
CLASS="indexterm"
NAME="AUTOID-8006"

>The local temporary
variables are put at the end of the parameter list. This is
<EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>essential</EM
>; parameters in the parameter list receive their
values, in order, from the values passed in the function call.
Any extra parameters, like normal awk variables, are initialized to the
empty string.
By convention, the local variables are separated from the &quot;real&quot; parameters by 
several spaces.
For instance, the following example shows how to define
the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>insert()</KBD
> function with two local variables.</P

In the main routine, we call the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>insert()</KBD
> function
and print its result.  Then we print different variables
to see what their value is, if any. 
Now let's run the above script and look at the output:</P
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="screen"
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>$ <CODE
CLASS="userinput"
><B
>echo &quot;Hello&quot; | awk -f insert.awk -</B
></CODE

Function returns HellXXo
The value of $1 after is: Hello
The value of STRING is:
The value of before_tmp:
The value of after_tmp: o</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
CLASS="para"
>The <KBD
CLASS="command"
>insert()</KBD
> function returns &quot;HellXXo,&quot; as expected.  
The value of $1 is the same after the function was called
as it was before.  The variable <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>STRING</B
> is local to the
function and it does not have a value when called from
the main routine.  The same is true for <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>before_tmp</B
>
because its name was placed in the parameter list for
the function definition.
The variable <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>after_tmp</B
> which was not specified in 
the parameter list does have a value, the letter &quot;o.&quot;</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>As this example shows, $1 is passed &quot;by value&quot; into the function.
This means that a copy is made of the value when the function
is called and the function manipulates the copy, not the original.  
Arrays, however, are passed &quot;by reference.&quot; That is, the function
does not work with a copy of the array but is passed the 
array itself.  Thus, any changes that the function
makes to the array are visible outside of the function. 
(This distinction between &quot;scalar&quot; variables and arrays  
also holds true for functions written in the C language.)
The next section presents an example of a function that
operates on an array. </P

The last section of each Xlib manpage is called &quot;Related Commands&quot;
(that is the argument of a .SH) and it's followed by a list of commands
(often 10 or 20) that are now in random order.  It'd be more
useful and professional if they were alphabetized.  Currently, commands
are separated by a comma after each one except the last, which has a
period.

The question is: could awk alphabetize these lists?  We're talking
about a couple of hundred manpages.  Again, don't bother if this is a
bigger job than it seems to someone who doesn't know what's involved.

Before
splitting up the commands into fields, we remove any number
of spaces following a comma.
Next we remove the final period and any trailing spaces.
Finally, we create the array <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>comArray</B
> using the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>split()</KBD
>
function.
We pass this array as an argument to the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>sort()</KBD
> function,
and then we print the sorted values.</P

>Once again, the virtue of calling a function to do the sort
versus writing or copying the code to do the same task is that  
the function is a module that's been tested previously and
has a standard interface.  That is, you know that it works and
you know how it works.  When you come upon the same sort code
in the awk version, which uses different variable names, you
have to scan it to verify that it works the same way as other
versions.  Even if you were to copy the lines into another program,
you would have to make changes to accommodate the new circumstances.
With a function, all you need to know is
what kind of arguments it expects and their calling sequence.
Using a function reduces the chance for error by
reducing the complexity of the problem that you are solving. </P
