whose job it is to standardize the index entries before they are

tab-separated fields: the index entry and its page number.  A colon is
used as part of the syntax for indicating the parts of an index entry.</P

CLASS="para"
>Because the program uses a colon as a special character, we must
provide a way to pass a literal colon through the program.  To do
this, we allow the indexer to specify two consecutive colons in the
input.  However, we can't simply convert the sequence to a literal
colon because the rest of the program modules called by
<KBD

solution is to convert the colon to its octal value using the

module, we use <KBD

CLASS="para"
>The first thing you notice is that we make this substitution
for each of the three fields separately, instead of having
one substitution command that operates on $0.  The reason for
this is that the input fields are colon-separated.  When
awk scans an input line, it breaks the line into fields.  If you 
change the contents of $0 at any point in the script, awk will 
reevaluate the value of $0 and parse the line into fields again.
Thus, if you have three fields prior to making the substitution,
and the substitution makes one change, adding a colon to $0,
then awk will recognize four fields.  By doing the substitution
for each field, we avoid having the line parsed again into
fields.</P

CLASS="para"
>Above we talked about the colon syntax for separating the primary and
secondary keys.  With some kinds of entries, it makes sense to
classify the item under its secondary key as well.  For instance, we
might have a group of program statements or user commands, such as
&quot;sed command.&quot;  The indexer might create two entries: one for &quot;sed
command&quot; and one for &quot;command: sed.&quot;  To make coding this kind of
entry easier, we implemented a coding convention that uses a tilde (~)
character to mark the two parts of this entry so that the first and
second part can be swapped to create the second entry automatically.[5]

Thus, coding the following index entry</P

automatically rotated where a blank is found; the tilde is used to
prevent a rotation by &quot;filling in&quot; the space.  Rather than have
rotation be the default action, we use a different coding convention,
where the tilde indicates where the rotation should occur.</P

second colon, not the first one.  It is pretty easy to solve in sed
because of the ability to select and recall a portion of what is
matched in the replacement section (using \(...\) to
surround the portion to match and \1 to recall the first portion).
Lacking the same ability in awk, you have to be more clever.  Here's
one possible solution:</P

CLASS="para"
>The first substitution matches the entire span between two colons.  It
makes a replacement with what is matched (&amp;) followed by a
semicolon.  This substitution occurs within a conditional expression
that evaluates the return value of the
<KBD
CLASS="command"
>sub()</KBD
> function.  Remember, this function
returns 1 if a substitution is made&nbsp;- it does not return the
resulting string. In other words, if we make the first substitution,
then we make the second one.  The second substitution replaces &quot;:;&quot;
with &quot;;&quot;.  Because we can't make the replacement directly, we do it
indirectly by making the context in which the second colon appears
distinct.</P

field and prepend it to the record as the sort key.  Now that there is
a duplicate of the first field, remove the escape sequences from the
