>I am often preparing technical documents, especially
for courses and training.  In these documents, I often
need to print source files of different kinds (C programs,
<KBD
CLASS="command"
>awk</KBD
> programs, shell scripts, makefiles).  The problem is that the 
sources often change with time and I want
the most recent version when I print. 
I also want to avoid typos in print.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>As I'm using <KBD
CLASS="command"
>troff</KBD
> for text processing, 
it should be easy to include
the original sources into the text.  But
there are some characters (especially &quot;&quot; and &quot;.&quot;
and &quot;,&quot; at the beginning of a line) that I must escape 
to prevent interpretation by <KBD
CLASS="command"
>troff</KBD
>.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>I often want excerpts from sources 
rather than a complete file.  I also need a mechanism for
setting page breaks. 
Well, perhaps I'm being a perfectionist, but
I don't want to see a C function printed nearly complete
on one page, but only the two last lines appear on the
next.  As I frequently change the documents, I cannot
hunt for &quot;nice&quot; page breaks&nbsp;- this must be done
automatically.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>To solve these set of problems, I wrote a filter that
preprocesses any source for inclusion
as text in <KBD
CLASS="command"
>troff</KBD
>.  This
is the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>awk</KBD
> program I send with this letter.  [He didn't offer
a name for it so it is here named <KBD
CLASS="command"
>readsource</KBD
>.] </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The
whole process can be further automated through 
<EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>makefiles</EM
>.  I include a preprocessed version of
the sources into my <KBD
CLASS="command"
>troff</KBD
> documents, and I make the formatting
dependent on these preprocessed files.  These files
again are dependent on their originals, so if I &quot;make&quot;
the document to print it, the
preprocessed sources will be checked to see if 
they are still current; otherwise
they will be generated new from their originals.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>My program contains a complete description in the form of
comments.  But as the description is more for me than
for others, I'll give you some more hints.  Basically,
the program simply guards some characters, e.g., &quot;\&quot; is
turned into &quot;\e&quot; and &quot;\&amp;&quot; is written before every line.
Tabs may be expanded to spaces (there's a switch for
it), and you may even generate line numbers in front
of every line (switch selectable).  The format of these
line numbers can be set through an environmental variable.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>If you want only <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>parts</EM
> of a file to be processed, you
can select these parts with two regular expressions (with
another switch).  You must specify the first line to 
be included and the first line not to be.  I've
found that this is often practical:  If you want to show
only a certain function of a C program, you can give the
first line of the function definition and the first line
of the next function definition.  If the source is
changed such that new functions are inserted between the two
or the order is changed, the pattern matching will not 
work correctly.  But this will accommodate the
more frequently made, smaller changes in a program.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The final feature, getting the page breaks right, 
is a bit tricky.  Here a technique has evolved that
I call &quot;here-you-may-break.&quot;  Those points are marked by
a special kind of line (I use &quot;/*!&quot; in C programs and
&quot;#!&quot; in awk, shell, makefiles, etc.).  How the points are
marked doesn't matter too much, you may have your own
conventions, but it must be possible to give a regular
expression that matches exactly this kind of line and
no others (e.g., if your sources are written so that a page
break is acceptable wherever you have an empty line, you
can specify this very easily, as all you need is the regular
expression for empty lines). </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Before all the marked lines, a special sequence will be inserted
which again is given by an environmental variable.  With <KBD
CLASS="command"
>troff</KBD
>,
I use the technique of opening a &quot;display&quot; (.DS) before
I include such preprocessed text, and inserting a close (.DE) and
new open (.DS) display wherever I would accept a page break.
After this, <KBD
CLASS="command"
>troff</KBD
> does the work of gathering as many lines
as fit onto the current page.  I suppose that suitable techniques
for other text processors exist.</P

# ==================================================================
# PROJECT:	Printing Tools
# SH-SCRIPT:	Source to Troff Pre-Formatter
# ==================================================================

#!
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# This programm is a tool to preformat source files, so that they
# can be included (.so) within nroff/troff-input. Problems when
# including arbitrary files within nroff/troff-input occur on lines,
# starting with dot (.) or an apostrophe ('), or with the respective
# chars, if these are changed, furthermore from embedded backslashes.
# While changing the source so that none of the above will cause
# any problems, some other useful things can be done, including
# line numbering and selecting interesting parts.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
#!
  USAGE=&quot;$0 [-x d] [-n] [-b pat] [-e pat] [-p pat] [file ...]&quot;
#
# SYNOPSIS:
# The following options are supported:
#	-x d	expand tabs to &quot;d&quot; spaces
#	-n 	number source lines (see also: NFMT)
#	-b pat	start output on a line containing &quot;pat&quot;,
#		including this line (Default: from beginning)
#	-e pat	end output on a line containing &quot;pat&quot;
#		excluding this line (Default: upto end)
#	-p pat	before lines containing &quot;pat&quot;, page breaks
#		may occur (Default: no page breaks)
# &quot;pat&quot; may be an &quot;extended regular expression&quot; as supported by awk.
# The following variables from the environment are used:
#	NFMT	specify format for line numbers (Default: see below)
#	PBRK	string, to mark page breaks. (Default: see below)
#!
# PREREQUISITES:
# Common UNIX-Environment, including awk.
#
# CAVEATS:
# &quot;pat&quot;s are not checked before they are used (processing may have
# started, before problems are detected).
# &quot;NFMT&quot; must contain exactly one %d-format specifier, if -n
# option is used.
# In &quot;NFMT&quot; and &quot;PBRK&quot;, embedded double quotes must be guarded with
# a leading backslash.
# In &quot;pat&quot;s, &quot;NFMT&quot; and &quot;PBRK&quot; embedded TABs and NLs must be written
# as \t and \n. Backslashes that should &quot;go thru&quot; to the output as
# such, should be doubled. (The latter is only *required* in a few
# special cases, but it does no harm the other cases).
# 
#!
# BUGS:
# Slow - but may serve as prototype for a faster implementation.
# (Hint: Guarding backslashes the way it is done by now is very
# expensive and could also be done using sed 's/\\/\\e/g', but tab
# expansion would be much harder then, because I can't imagine how
# to do it with sed. If you have no need for tab expansion, you may
# change the program. Another option would be to use gsub(), which
# would limit the program to environments with nawk.)
# 
# Others bugs may be, please mail me.
