This program was brought to my attention by
Ozan Yigit.
Jon Bentley kindly sent me his current version of the program, as
well as an early draft of his article (I was having trouble getting a
copy of the published one). A PostScript version of this paper is included
with the example programs, available from O'Reilly's FTP server (see
the Preface).
I wrote these introductory notes, and the program notes below. [A.R.]</P

The second rule simply loops through all the defined macros, performing
a global substitution of each macro with its body in the input line, and
then printing the line.

# NAME
#
# m1
#
# USAGE
#
# awk -f m1.awk [file...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
# M1 copies its input file(s) to its output unchanged except as modified by
# certain &quot;macro expressions.&quot;  The following lines define macros for
# subsequent processing:
#
#     @comment Any text
#     @@                     same as @comment
#     @define name value
#     @default name value    set if name undefined
#     @include filename
#     @if varname            include subsequent text if varname != 0
#     @unless varname        include subsequent text if varname == 0
#     @fi                    terminate @if or @unless
#     @ignore DELIM          ignore input until line that begins with DELIM
#     @stderr stuff          send diagnostics to standard error
#
# A definition may extend across many lines by ending each line with
# a backslash, thus quoting the following newline.
#
# Any occurrence of @name@ in the input is replaced in the output by
# the corresponding value.
#
# @name at beginning of line is treated the same as @name@.
#
# BUGS
#
# M1 is three steps lower than m4.  You'll probably miss something
# you have learned to expect.

It simply processes either standard input, if there are no arguments,

The variable <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>fname</B
> indicates the current file to read data from.
When an &quot;@include&quot; directive is seen, <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>dofile()</B

recursively on the new file, as in <KBD

Interestingly, the included filename is first processed for macros.
Read this function carefully&nbsp;- there are some nice tricks here.</P

a macro, macro processors examine the newly created text for any additional
macro names.  Only after all expanded text has been processed and

><P
CLASS="para"
>The <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>dosubs()</B
> function actually performs the macro substitution.
It processes the line left-to-right, replacing macro names with their
bodies. The rescanning of the new line is left to the higher-level
logic that is jointly managed by <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>readline()</B
> and <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>dofile()</B
>.
This version is considerably more efficient than the brute-force
approach used in the <KBD
CLASS="command"
>m0</KBD
> programs.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Finally, the <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>dodef()</B
> function handles the defining of macros.
It saves the macro name from $2, and then uses <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>sub()</B
> to remove
the first two fields.
The new value of $0 now contains just (the first line of) the macro body.
The <CITE
CLASS="citetitle"
>Computer Language</CITE
> article explains that <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>sub()</B
> is used
on purpose, in order to preserve whitespace in the macro body.
Simply assigning the empty string to $1 and $2 would rebuild the record,
but with all occurrences of whitespace collapsed into single occurrences
of the value of <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>OFS</B
> (a single blank).
The function then proceeds to gather the rest of the macro body, indicated
by lines that end with a &quot;\&quot;.
This is an additional improvement over <KBD
CLASS="command"
>m0</KBD
>: macro bodies can be
more than one line long.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The rest of the program is concerned with conditional inclusion or
exclusion of text; this part is straightforward. What's nice is that
these conditionals can be nested inside each other.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
><KBD
CLASS="command"
>m1</KBD
> is a very nice start at a macro processor.  You might want to
think about how you could expand upon it; for instance, by allowing
conditionals to have an &quot;@else&quot; clause; processing the command line
for macro definitions; &quot;undefining&quot; macros, and the other sorts of
things that macro processors usually do.</P
