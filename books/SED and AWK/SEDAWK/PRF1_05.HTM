>Since this book was first published in 1990, it has become one of the
most fundamental of the O'Reilly &amp; Associates Nutshell Handbooks.
Three important events occurred after it was written.  The first was
the publication of the POSIX standard for sed, and more importantly
for awk.  The second (perhaps due to the first) was the widespread
availability of some version or other of new awk on all modern UNIX
systems, both commercial ones and the freely available UNIX-like
systems such as NetBSD, FreeBSD, and Linux.  The third was the source
code availability of GNU sed, and three versions of awk, instead of
just gawk.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>For these and other reasons, O'Reilly &amp; Associates decided that
this handbook needed to be updated.  The goals of the revision were to
keep the flavor of the book intact (&quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix
it&quot;), reorient the awk part of the book around POSIX awk, correct
mistakes, and bring the book up to date.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>I would like to thank Gigi Estabrook, Chris Reilley, and Lenny Muellner
of O'Reilly &amp; Associates for their help, Marc Vauclair, the French
translator of the first edition, for many helpful comments, and John
Dzubera for his comments on the first edition.  Michael Brennan, Henry
Spencer, and Ozan Yigit acted as technical reviewers for this edition,
and I would like to thank them for their input.  Ozan Yigit, in
particular, deserves extra thanks for forcing me to be very rigorous
in my testing.  Pat Thompson of Thompson Automation Software
graciously provided an evaluation copy of <KBD

>tawk</KBD
> for
review in this book.  Richard Montgomery of Videosoft provided me with
information about VSAwk.</P

Nicole Gipson Arigo was the production editor and project manager.
David Sewell was the copyeditor, and Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary
proofread the book. Jane Ellin and
Sheryl Avruch performed quality control checks. Seth Maislin wrote the
index. Erik Ray, Ellen Siever, and Lenny Muellner worked with the tools
to create the book. Chris Reilley fine-tuned the figures. Nancy Priest
and Mary Jane Walsh designed the interior book layout, and Edie Freedman
designed the front cover.</P

>My in-laws, Marshall and Elaine Hartholz of Seattle, deserve special
thanks for taking our children camping for a week, allowing me to make
significant progress during an important phase of the update. :-)</P
