<H2 class="docAppendixTitle">Appendix B. The Memory Cache</H2>


<P class="docText">Squid stores some of its recently retrieved objects fully in memory.
As you might expect, serving objects from memory
<A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2381"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2382"></A>is generally faster than reading the
data from the disk. In some places, Squid calls
<A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2383"></A>this the
<span class="docEmphasis">hot object cache</span>. The
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_mem</span> directive specifies how much memory
Squid should use for in-memory objects.</P>

<P class="docText">I usually recommend setting <span class="docEmphasis">cache_mem</span> to a small
size, such as something between 8 and 32 MB. If you happen to have
tons of extra memory, you can set it higher. In most cases, however,
your extra memory is better used by increasing your disk cache size
(see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.3.2">Section 7.1.3.2</A>).</P>

<P class="docText">Many people misunderstand <A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2384"></A>the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_mem</span>
directive. They expect it to limit the total amount of memory that
Squid uses. Unfortunately, for them, this assumption is incorrect.
Squid doesn't have a directive that limits total
memory consumption. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.3.2">Section 7.1.3.2</A> and
<A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.html#squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.8">Section 16.1.8</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">The current version of Squid (2.5) stores objects in memory only if
they come from the network (origin server or neighbor cache). If
Squid reads an object from disk, it doesn't also
store it in memory. Older versions of Squid had that functionality.
However, it was removed during a major rewrite to simplify the source
code.</P>

<P class="docText">Only objects smaller than a certain size are held in memory. The
<span class="docEmphasis">maximum_object_size_in_memory</span> directive controls
this setting. Its default value is 8 KB, which is typically large
enough to fit more than half of all responses Squid receives. This
directive also limits the amount of memory used for each cache miss
as the response is being received. If you have a high request rate
but are low on memory, you may want to lower this value to 4 KB.
Squid allocates memory for object data in 4-KB chunks. Thus, it makes
sense to assign this directive a multiple of 4 KB. Other values end
up wasting memory.</P>

<P class="docText">In-memory objects fall into one of two
<A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2385"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2386"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2387"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2388"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2389"></A>groups:
<span class="docEmphasis">in-transit</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">complete</span>.
Squid uses the memory cache for both types. Complete objects are held
in memory only if there is some free space. They have lower priority
than in-transit objects. If your cache is busy, the memory cache may
contain nothing but in-transit objects (or,
<span class="docEmphasis">maximum_object_size_in_memory</span> chunks of
in-transit objects, actually). Furthermore, Squid always allocates
memory for in-transit objects, even if it must exceed the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_mem</span> limit. When an in-transit object
becomes a complete object, it is kept in memory only if the memory
cache size is below the limit.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">memory_replacement_policy</span>
<A NAME="squid-APP-B-ITERM-2390"></A>directive is analogous to
<span class="docEmphasis">replacement_policy</span>. It controls the replacement
policy for objects cached in memory. Because the memory cache is
typically much smaller than the disk cache, your choice of
replacement policy may have a bigger impact. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-5.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-5">Section 7.5</A> for a description of available replacement
policies.</P>
