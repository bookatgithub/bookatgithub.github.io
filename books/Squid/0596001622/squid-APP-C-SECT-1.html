<P class="docText">The delay pools are, <A NAME="squid-APP-C-ITERM-2391"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-C-ITERM-2392"></A>essentially "bandwidth
buckets." A response is delayed until some amount of
bandwidth is available from an appropriate bucket. The buckets
don't actually store bandwidth (e.g., 100 Kbit/s),
but rather some amount of traffic (e.g., 384 KB). Squid adds some
amount of traffic to the buckets each second. Cache clients take some
amount of traffic out when they receive data from an upstream source
(origin server or neighbor).</P>

<P class="docText">The size of a bucket determines how much burst bandwidth is available
to a client. If a bucket starts out full, a client can take as much
traffic as it needs until the bucket becomes empty. The client then
receives traffic allotments at the fill rate.</P>

<P class="docText">The mapping between Squid clients and actual buckets is a bit
complicated. Squid uses three different constructs to do it: access
rules, delay pool classes, and types of buckets. First, Squid checks
a client request against the <span class="docEmphasis">delay_access</span> list.
If the request is a match, it points to a particular delay pool. Each
delay pool has a class: 1, 2, or 3. The classes determine which types
of buckets are in use. Squid has three types of buckets: aggregate,
individual, and network:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">A class 1 pool has a single aggregate bucket.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A class 2 pool has an aggregate bucket and 256 individual buckets.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A class 3 pool has an aggregate bucket, 256 network buckets, and
65,536 individual buckets.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">As you can probably guess, the individual and network buckets
correspond to IP address octets. In a class 2 pool, the individual
bucket is determined by the last octet of the
client's IPv4 address. In a class 3 pool, the
network bucket is determined by the third octet, and the individual
bucket by the third and fourth octets.</P>

<P class="docText">For the class 2 and 3 delay pools, you can disable buckets you
don't want to use. For example, you can define a
class 2 pool with only individual buckets by disabling the aggregate
bucket.</P>

<P class="docText">When a request goes through a pool with more than one bucket type, it
takes bandwidth from all buckets. For example, consider a class 3
pool with aggregate, network, and individual buckets. If the
individual bucket has 20 KB, the network bucket 30 KB, but the
aggregate bucket only 2 KB, the client receives only a 2-KB
allotment. Even though some buckets have plenty of traffic, the
client is limited by the bucket with the smallest amount.</P>
