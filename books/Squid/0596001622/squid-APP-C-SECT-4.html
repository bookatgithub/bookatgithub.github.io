<P class="docText">Squid's delay pools are often useful, but not
perfect. You need to be aware of a few drawbacks and limitations
before you use them.</P>

<A NAME="squid-APP-C-SECT-4.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">C.4.1 Fairness</H4>

<P class="docText">One of the most important things to realize about the current delay
pools implementation is that it does nothing to guarantee fairness
among all users of a single bucket. This is especially important for
aggregate buckets (where sharing is high), but less so for individual
buckets (where sharing is low).</P>

<P class="docText">Squid generally services requests in order of increasing file
descriptors. Thus, a request whose server-side TCP connection has a
lower file descriptor may receive more bandwidth from a shared bucket
than it should.</P>


<A NAME="squid-APP-C-SECT-4.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">C.4.2 Application Versus Transport Layer</H4>

<P class="docText">Bandwidth shaping and
<A NAME="squid-APP-C-ITERM-2401"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-C-ITERM-2402"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-C-ITERM-2403"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-C-ITERM-2404"></A>rate limiting usually
operate at the network transport layer. There, the flow of packets
can be controlled very precisely. Delay pools, however, are
implemented in the application layer. Because Squid
doesn't actually send and receive TCP packets (the
kernel does), it has less control over the flow of individual
packets. Rather than controlling the transmission and receipt of
packets on the wire, Squid controls only how many bytes to read from
the kernel.</P>

<P class="docText">This means, for example, that incoming response data is queued up in
the kernel. The TCP/IP stack can buffer some number of bytes that
haven't yet been read by Squid. On most systems, the
default TCP receive buffer size is usually between 32 KB and 64 KB.
In other words, this much data can arrive over the network very
quickly, regardless of anything Squid can do. On the one hand, it
seems silly to read this data slowly even though it is already on
your system. On the other hand, because the client
doesn't receive the whole response right away, it is
likely to postpone any future requests until the delayed responses
are complete.</P>

<P class="docText">If you are concerned that the kernel buffers too much server-side
data, you can decrease the TCP receive buffer size with the
<span class="docEmphasis">tcp_recv_bufsize</span> directive. Even better, your
operating system probably has a way to set this parameter for the
whole system. On NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD, you can use the sysctl
variable named <span class="docEmphasis">net.inet.tcp.recvspace</span>. For
Linux, read about <I>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</I> in
<I>Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt</I>.</P>


<A NAME="squid-APP-C-SECT-4.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">C.4.3 Fixed Subnetting Scheme</H4>

<P class="docText">The current delay pools <A NAME="squid-APP-C-ITERM-2405"></A><A NAME="squid-APP-C-ITERM-2406"></A>implementation assumes that your LAN uses
/24 (class C) subnets, and that all users are in the same /16 (class
B) subnet. This might not be so bad, depending on how your network is
configured. However, it would be nice if the delay pools subnetting
scheme were fully customizable.</P>

<P class="docText">If your address space is larger than a /24 and smaller than a 16/,
you can always create a class 3 pool and treat it as a class 2 pool
(that is one of the examples given earlier).</P>

<P class="docText">If you use just one class 2 pool with more than 256 users, some users
will share the individual buckets. That might not be so bad, unless
you happen to have a bunch of heavy users fighting over one measly
bucket.</P>

<P class="docText">You might also create multiple class 2 pools and use
<span class="docEmphasis">delay_access</span> rules to divide them up among all
users. The problem with this approach is that you
can't have all users share a single aggregate
bucket. Instead, each subgroup has their own aggregate bucket. You
can't make a single client go through more than one
delay pool.</P>
