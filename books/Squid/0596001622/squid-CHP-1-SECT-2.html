<H3 class="docSection1Title">1.2 A Brief History of Squid</H3>

<P class="docText">In the beginning
<A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1096"></A>was the CERN HTTP server. In addition to
functioning as an HTTP server, it was also the first caching proxy.
The caching module was written by Ari Luotonen in 1994.</P>

<P class="docText">That same year, the Internet Research Task Force Group on Resource
Discovery (IRTF-RD) started the Harvest project. It was
"an integrated set of tools to gather, extract,
organize, search, cache, and replicate" Internet
information. I joined the Harvest project near the end of 1994. While
most people used Harvest as a local (or distributed) search engine,
the Object Cache component was quite popular as well. The Harvest
cache boasted three major improvements over the CERN cache: faster
use of the filesystem, a single process design, and caching
hierarchies via the Internet Cache Protocol.</P>

<P class="docText">Towards the end of 1995, many Harvest team members made the move to
the exciting world of Internet-based startup companies. The original
authors of the Harvest cache code, Peter Danzig and Anawat
Chankhunthod, turned it into a commercial product. Their company was
<A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1097"></A>later acquired by Network Appliance.
In early 1996, I joined the National Laboratory for Applied Network
Research (NLANR) to work on the Information Resource Caching
(IRCache) <A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1098"></A>project, funded by the National Science
Foundation. Under this project, we took the Harvest cache code,
renamed it Squid, and released it under the GNU General Public
License.</P>

<P class="docText">Since that time Squid has grown in size and features. It now supports
a number of cool things such as URL redirection, traffic shaping,
sophisticated access controls, numerous authentication modules,
advanced disk storage options, HTTP interception, and surrogate mode
(a.k.a. HTTP server acceleration).</P>

<P class="docText">Funding for the IRCache project ended in July 2000. Today, a number
of volunteers continue to develop and support Squid. We occasionally
receive financial or other types of support from companies that
benefit from Squid.</P>

<P class="docText">Looking towards the future, we are rewriting Squid in C++ and, at the
same time, fixing a number of design issues in the older code that
are limiting to new features. We are adding support for protocols
<A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1099"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1100"></A>such as Edge Side
Includes (ESI) and Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP). We
also plan to make Squid support IPv6. A few developers are constantly
making Squid run better on Microsoft Windows platforms. Finally, we
will add more and more HTTP/1.1 features and work towards full
compliance with the latest protocol specification.</P>
