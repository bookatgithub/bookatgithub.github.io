<P class="docText">Squid runs on all <A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1101"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1102"></A>popular
Unix systems, as well as Microsoft Windows. Although
Squid's Windows support is improving all the time,
you may have an easier time with Unix. If you have a favorite
operating system, I'd suggest using that one.
Otherwise, if you're looking for a recommendation, I
really like FreeBSD.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid's hardware requirements are generally modest.
Memory is often the most important resource. A
<A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1103"></A>memory
shortage causes a drastic degradation in performance. Disk space is,
naturally, another important factor. More disk space means more
cached objects and higher hit ratios. Fast disks and interfaces are
also beneficial. SCSI performs better than ATA, if you can justify
the higher costs. While fast CPUs are nice, they
aren't critical to good performance.</P>

<P class="docText">Because Squid uses a small amount of memory for every cached
response, there is a relationship between disk space and memory
requirements. As a rule of thumb, you need 32 MB of memory for each
GB of disk space. Thus, a system with 512 MB of RAM can support a
16-GB disk cache. Your mileage may vary, of course. Memory
requirements depend on factors such as the mean object size, CPU
architecture (32- or 64-bit), the number of concurrent users, and
particular features that you use.</P>

<P class="docText">People often ask such questions as, "I have a
network with X users. What kind of hardware do I need for
Squid?" These <A NAME="squid-CHP-1-ITERM-1104"></A>questions are difficult to answer
for a number of reasons. In particular, it's hard to
say how much traffic X users will generate. I usually find it easier
to look at bandwidth usage, and go from there. I tell people to build
a system with enough disk space to hold 3-7 days worth of web
traffic. For example, if your users consume 1 Mbps (HTTP and FTP
traffic only) for 8 hours per day, that's about 3.5
GB per day. So, I'd say you want between 10 and 25
GB of disk space for each Mbps of web traffic.</P>
