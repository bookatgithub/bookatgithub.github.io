<P class="docText">As you probably realize by now, Squid has many different ways to
decide how and where requests are forwarded. In many cases, you can
employ more than one protocol or technique at a time. Just by looking
at the configuration file, however, you'd probably
have a hard time figuring out how Squid uses the different techniques
in combination. In this section I'll explain how
Squid actually makes the forwarding decision.</P>

<P class="docText">Obviously, it all starts with a cache miss. Any request that is
satisfied as an unvalidated cache hit doesn't go
through the following sequence of events.</P>

<P class="docText">The goal of the selection procedure is to create a list of
appropriate next-hop locations. A next-hop location may be a neighbor
cache or the origin server. Depending on your configuration, Squid
may select up to three possible next-hops. If the request
can't be satisfied by the first, Squid tries the
second, and so on.</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-SECT-10.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.10.1 Step 1: Determine Direct Options</H4>

<P class="docText">The first step is to determine if <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1679"></A>the request may, must, or must not be
sent directly to the origin server. Squid evaluates the
<span class="docEmphasis">never_direct</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">always_direct</span> access rule lists for the request.
The goal is to set a flag to one of three values: DIRECT_YES,
DIRECT_MAYBE, or DIRECT_NO. This flag later determines whether Squid
should, or should not, try to select a neighbor cache for the
request. Squid checks the following conditions in order. If any
condition is true, it sets the direct flag and proceeds to the next
step. If you're following along in the source code,
this step corresponds to the beginning of the
<I>peerSelectFoo( )</I> function:</P>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Squid looks at the <span class="docEmphasis">always_direct</span> list first. If

measured hop count or round-trip time is lower than the configured
values, Squid sets the direct flag to DIRECT_YES.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">If none of the previous conditions are true, Squid sets the direct
flag to DIRECT_MAYBE.</P></span></LI></OL></span>
<P class="docText">If the direct flag is set to DIRECT_YES, the selection process is
complete. Squid forwards the request directly to the origin server

<P class="docText">Here Squid uses one of the <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1680"></A>hierarchical protocols to select a
neighbor cache. As before, once Squid selects a neighbor in this
step, it exits the routine and proceeds to Step 3. This step roughly

with any of the parent caches for a particular request.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Squid checks <span class="docEmphasis">netdb</span> measurements (if enabled) for
a "closest parent." If Squid knows
that the round-trip time from one or more parents to the origin
server is less than its own RTT to the origin server, Squid selects
the parent with the least RTT. For this to happen, the following
conditions must be met:</P><UL><LI><P class="docList">Both your Squid and the parent cache(s) must have enabled

next-hop selection procedure is postponed until the replies arrive,
or a timeout occurs. Squid expects to receive replies from neighbors
that are alive, but not neighbors that are dead (see 
<A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10-SECT-3.html#squid-CHP-10-SECT-3.2">Section 10.3.2</A>).</P></span></LI></OL></span>

<P class="docText">If Squid sends out any ICP or HTCP queries, it
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1681"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1682"></A>waits for some number of replies.
Just after transmitting the queries, Squid knows how many replies to
expect and the maximum amount of time to wait for them. Squid expects
a reply from every alive neighbor queried. If you're
using multicast, Squid adds the current group size estimate to the
expected reply count. While waiting for replies, Squid schedules a
timeout, in case one or more of the replies don't
arrive.</P>

<P class="docText">When Squid receives an ICP/HTCP reply from a neighbor, it takes the
following actions:</P>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">If the reply is a hit, Squid forwards the request to that neighbor
immediately. Any replies arriving after this point are ignored.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">If the reply is a miss, and it is from a sibling, it is ignored.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Squid doesn't immediately act on ICP/HTCP misses
from parents. Instead, it remembers which parents meet the following

<DD>
<P class="docList">Squid remembers the parent that had the first reply. In other words,
the parent with least RTT to your cache. Two

<TT>closest-only</TT>.</P>

<P class="docList">The <TT>weight=</TT><TT><I>N</I></TT> option
makes a parent closer than it really is. When calculating RTTs, Squid
divides the actual RTT by this artificial weight. Thus you can give
higher preference to certain parents by increasing their weight
value.</P>

<P class="docList">The <TT>closest-only</TT> option disables the first-parent
miss feature for a neighbor cache. In other words, Squid selects a
parent (based on ICP/HTCP miss replies) only if that parent is the
closest to the origin server.</P>
</DD>
</DL></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">If Squid receives the expected number of replies (all misses), or if

<P class="docText">Squid may not receive any ICP/HTCP replies from parent caches, either
because they weren't queried or because the network
dropped some packets. In this case, Squid relies on the secondary
parent (or direct) selection algorithm described in the next section.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.10.4 Step 3: Secondary Parent Selection</H4>

<P class="docText">This step is a little tricky. Remember that if the direct flag is
DIRECT_YES, Squid never executes this step. If the flag is DIRECT_NO,
Squid calls the <I>getSomeParent( )</I> function
(described subsequently) to <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1683"></A>select a backup parent, in case Step
2 failed to select one. Following that, Squid adds to the list all
parents it believes are alive. Thus, it tries all possible parent
caches before returning an error message to the user.</P>

<P class="docText">In the case of DIRECT_MAYBE, Squid adds both a parent cache, and the
origin server. The order, however, depends on the
<span class="docEmphasis">prefer_direct</span> setting. If
<span class="docEmphasis">prefer_direct</span> is enabled, Squid inserts the
origin server into the list first. Next, Squid calls
<I>getSomeParent( )</I> if the request is hierarchical
or if the <span class="docEmphasis">nonhierarchical_direct</span> directive is
disabled. Finally, Squid adds the origin server last if
<span class="docEmphasis">prefer_direct</span> is disabled.</P>

<P class="docText">The <I>getSomeParent( )</I> function selects one of the

<P class="docText">Occasionally, Squid's attempt to
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1684"></A>forward a request to an origin server
or neighbor may fail for one reason or another. This is why Squid
creates a list of appropriate next-hop locations during the neighbor
selection procedure. When one of the following types of errors
occurs, Squid can retry the request at the next server in the list:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Network congestion or other errors can cause a
"connection timeout."</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">The origin server or neighbor cache may be temporarily unavailable,
causing a "connection refused"
error.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A sibling may return a 504 (Gateway Timeout) error if the request
would cause a cache miss.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A neighbor may return an "access
denied" error message if the two caches have a
mismatch in access control policies.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">A read error may occur on an established connection before Squid
reads the HTTP message body.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">There may be race conditions with persistent connections.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Squid's algorithm for retrying failed requests is
relatively aggressive. It is better for Squid to keep trying (causing
