<H3 class="docSection1Title">10.2 Why (Not) Use a Hierarchy?</H3>

<P class="docText">A neighbor cache improves <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1597"></A>performance by providing some extra
fraction of requests as cache hits. In other words, some of the
requests that are misses in your cache may be hits in the neighbor
cache. If your cache can download these neighbor hits faster than
from the origin server, the hierarchy should improve performance
overall. The downside is that neighbor caches usually provide only a
small percentage of requests as hits. About 5%, or maybe 10% if
you're lucky, of your requests that are cache misses
will be hits in a neighbor. In some cases, this small benefit
doesn't justify the hassle of joining a hierarchy.
In other cases, such as networks with poor or overutilized
connectivity, hierarchies definitely improve performance for end
users.</P>

<P class="docText">If you use Squid inside a firewalled network, you may need to
configure the firewall proxy as a parent. In this case, Squid
forwards every request to the firewall because it
can't connect directly to outside origin servers. If
you have some origin servers inside the firewall, you can instruct
Squid to connect to them directly.</P>

<P class="docText">You can also use a hierarchy to send web traffic in different
directions. This is sometimes called <I>application-layer
routing</I>, <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1598"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1599"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1600"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1601"></A>or
more recently, <I>content routing</I>. Consider, for
example, a large organization with two Internet connections. Perhaps
the second connection costs less, or has higher latency, than the
other. This organization may want to use the second connection for
low-priority traffic, such as downloading binaries, audio and video
files, or other kinds of large transfers. Or, perhaps they want to
send all HTTP traffic over one link, and non-HTTP traffic over the
other. Or, perhaps certain users' traffic should go
through the low-priority connection, while premium customers get to
use the more expensive link. You can accomplish any of these
scenarios with a hierarchy of caching proxies.</P>

<P class="docText">Trust is one of the most important issues for the members of a cache
hierarchy. You must trust your neighbors to serve correct, unmodified
responses. You must trust them with sensitive information, such as
the URIs requested by your users. You must trust that they maintain
secure and up-to-date systems to minimize the chances of unauthorized
access and denials of service.</P>

<P class="docText">Another problem with hierarchies is the way that they normally
propagate errors. When a neighbor cache experiences an error, such as
an unreachable server, it generates an HTML page that explains the
error and its origin. Your users may become confused if they get
errors from neighbor caches outside the immediate organization. If
the problem persists, they'll have a hard time
finding an administrator who can help them.</P>

<P class="docText">Sibling relationships are subject to special problem,
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1602"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1603"></A>known as <I>false
hits</I>. This occurs when Squid sends a request to a
sibling, believing it will be a cache hit, but the sibling is unable
to satisfy the request without contacting the origin server. False
hits happen in a number of circumstances, but usually with a low
probability. Furthermore, Squid and other HTTP proxies have features
for automatically retrying such requests so that the user
isn't even aware of the problem.</P>

<P class="docText">A <I>forwarding loop</I> is another
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1604"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1605"></A>problem sometimes seen in
cache hierarchies. It occurs when Squid forwards a request somewhere,
but that request comes back to Squid again, as shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-10-FIG-1">Figure 10-1</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">Forwarding loops typically happen when two caches consider each other
parents. If you have such an arrangement, make sure that
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1606"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1607"></A>you use the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_peer_access</span> directive to prevent loops.
For example, if the neighbor's IP address is
192.168.1.1, the following lines ensure Squid won't
cause a forwarding loop:</P>

<PRE>acl FromNeighbor src 192.168.1.1
cache_peer_access the.neighbor.name deny FromNeighbor</PRE>

<P class="docText">Forwarding loops can also occur with HTTP interception, especially if
the interception device is on the path between Squid and an origin
server.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid detects forwarding loops by looking for its own hostname in the
<TT>Via</TT> header. You may actually get false forwarding
loops if two cooperating caches have the same hostname. The
<span class="docEmphasis">unique_hostname</span> directive is useful in this
situation. Note that if the <TT>Via</TT> header is filtered
out (e.g., with <span class="docEmphasis">headers_access</span>), Squid
can't detect forwarding loops.</P>
