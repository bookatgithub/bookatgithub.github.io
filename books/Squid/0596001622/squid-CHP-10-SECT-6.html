<P class="docText">ICP is a lightweight object <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1639"></A>location protocol invented as a part
of the Harvest project.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-10-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> An
ICP client sends a query message to one or more ICP servers, asking
if they have a particular URI cached. Each server replies with an
<TT>ICP_HIT</TT>, <TT>ICP_MISS</TT>, or other
type of ICP message. The ICP client uses the information in the ICP
replies to make a forwarding decision.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> For more information, see the
following papers: "A Hierarchical Internet Object
Cache," by Danzig, Chankhunthod, et al,
<span class="docEmphasis">USENIX Annual Technical Conference, 1995</span>, and
"The Harvest information discovery and access
system," by C. Mic Bowman, Peter B. Danzig, Darren
R. Hardy, Udi Manber, and Michael F. Schwartz, Proceedings of the
Second International World Wide Web Conference.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">In addition to predicting cache hits, ICP is also useful for
providing hints about network conditions between Squid and the
neighbor. ICP messages are similar to ICMP pings in this regard. By
measuring the query/response round-trip time, Squid can estimate
network congestion. In the extreme case, ICP messages may be lost,
indicating that the path between the two is down or congested. From
this, Squid decides to avoid the neighbor for that particular
request.</P>

<P class="docText">Increased latency is perhaps the most significant drawback to using
ICP. The query/response exchange takes some time. Caching proxies are
supposed to decrease response time, not add more latency. If ICP
helps us discover cache hits in neighbors, then it may lead to an
overall reduction in response time. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10-SECT-10.html#squid-CHP-10-SECT-10">Section 10.10</A> for a description of the
query algorithm implemented in Squid.</P>

<P class="docText">ICP also suffers from a number of design deficiencies: security,
scalability, false hits, and the lack of a request method. The
protocol doesn't include any security features. In
general, Squid can't verify that an ICP message is
authentic; it relies on address-based access controls to filter out
unwanted ICP messages.</P>

<P class="docText">ICP has poor scaling <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1640"></A>properties. The number of ICP messages (and
bandwidth) grows in proportion to the number of neighbors. Unless you
use some kind of partitioning scheme, this places a practical limit
on the number of neighbors you can have. I don't
recommend having more than five or six neighbors.</P>

<P class="docText">ICP queries contain only URIs, with no additional request headers.
This makes it difficult to predict cache hits with perfect accuracy.
An HTTP request may include additional headers (such as
<TT>Cache-Control</TT>: <TT>max-stale=N</TT>)
that turn a cache hit into a cache miss. These false hits are
particularly awkward for sibling relationships.</P>

<P class="docText">Also missing from the ICP query <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1641"></A>message
is the request method. ICP assumes that all queries are for
<TT>GET</TT> requests. A caching proxy
can't use ICP to locate cached objects for
non-<TT>GET</TT> request methods.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.6.1 Being an ICP Server</H4>

<P class="docText">When you use the <span class="docEmphasis">icp_port</span> directive, Squid
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1642"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1643"></A>automatically becomes an ICP server.
That is, it listens for ICP messages on the port
you've specified, or port 3130 by default. Be sure
to tell your sibling and/or child caches if you decide to use a
nonstandard port.</P>

<P class="docText">By default, Squid denies all ICP queries. You must use the
<I>icp_access</I> rule list to allow queries from your
neighbors. It's usually easiest to do this with
<span class="docEmphasis">src</span> ACLs. For example:</P>

<PRE>acl N1 src 192.168.0.1
acl N2 src 172.16.0.2
acl All src 0/0
icp_access allow N1
icp_access allow N2
icp_access deny All</PRE>

<P class="docText">Note that only <TT>ICP_QUERY</TT> messages are subject to
the <I>icp_access</I> rules. ICP client functions, such
as sending queries and receiving replies, don't
require any special access controls. I also recommend that you take
advantage of your operating system's packet
filtering features (e.g., <TT>ipfw</TT>,
<TT>iptables</TT>, and <TT>pf</TT>) if possible.
Allow UDP messages on the ICP port from your trusted neighbors and
deny them from all other hosts.</P>

<P class="docText">When Squid denies an ICP query due to the
<I>icp_access</I> rules, it sends back an
<TT>ICP_DENIED</TT> message. However, if Squid detects that
more than 95% of the recent queries have been denied, it stops
responding for an hour. When this happens, Squid writes a message in
<I>cache.log</I>:</P>

<PRE>WARNING: Probable misconfigured neighbor at foo.web-cache.com
WARNING: 150 of the last 150 ICP replies are DENIED
WARNING: No replies will be sent for the next 3600 seconds</PRE>

<P class="docText">If you see this message, you should contact the administrator
responsible for the misconfigured cache.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid was designed to answer ICP queries immediately. That is, Squid
can tell whether or not it has a fresh, cached response by checking
the in-memory index. This is also why Squid is a bit of a memory hog.
When an ICP query comes in, Squid calculates the MD5 hash of the URI
and looks for it in the index. If not found, Squid sends back an
<TT>ICP_MISS</TT> message. If found, Squid checks the
expiration time. If the object isn't fresh, Squid
returns <TT>ICP_MISS</TT>. For fresh objects, Squid returns
<TT>ICP_HIT</TT>.</P>

<P class="docText">By default, Squid logs all ICP queries (but not responses) to
<I>access.log</I>. If you have a lot of busy neighbors,
your log file may become too large to manage. Use the
<span class="docEmphasis">log_icp_queries</span> directive to prevent logging of
these queries. Although you'll lose the detailed
logging for ICP, you can still get some aggregate stats via the cache
manager (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-14-SECT-2.html#squid-CHP-14-SECT-2.1.24">Section 14.2.1.24</A>).</P>

<P class="docText">If you have sibling neighbors, you'll probably
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1644"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1645"></A>want to use
the <span class="docEmphasis">miss_access</span> directive to enforce the
relationship. It specifies an access rule for cache misses. It is
similar to <span class="docEmphasis">http_access</span> but is checked only for
requests that must be forwarded. The default rule is to allow all
cache misses. Unless you add some <span class="docEmphasis">miss_access</span>
rules, any sibling cache can become a child cache and forward cache
misses through your network connection, thus stealing your bandwidth.</P>

<P class="docText">Your <span class="docEmphasis">miss_access</span> rules can be relatively simple.
Don't forget to include your local clients (i.e.,
web browsers) as well. Here's a simple example:</P>

<PRE>acl Browsers src 10.9.0.0/16
acl Child1 src 172.16.3.4
acl Child2 src 192.168.2.0/24
acl All src 0/0
miss_access allow Browsers
miss_access allow Child1
miss_access allow Child2
miss_access deny All</PRE>

<P class="docText">Note that I haven't listed any siblings here. The
child caches are allowed to request misses through us, but the
siblings are not. Their cache miss requests are denied by the
<TT>deny All</TT> rule.</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-SECT-6.1.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.6.1.1 The icp_hit_stale directive</H5>

<P class="docText">One of the problems with ICP is that
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1646"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1647"></A>it returns
<TT>ICP_MISS</TT> for cached but stale responses. This is
true even if the response is stale, but valid (such that a validation
request returns "not modified").
Consider a simple hierarchy with a child and two parent caches. An
object is cached by one parent but not the other. The cached response
is stale, but unchanged, and needs validation. The
child's ICP query results in two
<TT>ICP_MISS</TT> replies. Not knowing that the stale
response exists in the first parent, the child forwards its request
to the second parent. Now the object is stored in both parents,
wasting resources.</P>

<P class="docText">You might find the <span class="docEmphasis">icp_hit_stale</span> directive
useful in this situation. It tells Squid to return an
<TT>ICP_HIT</TT> for any cached object, even if it is
stale. This is perfectly safe for parent relationships but can create
problems for siblings.</P>

<P class="docText">Recall that in a sibling relationship, the client cache is only
allowed to make requests that are cache hits. Enabling the
<span class="docEmphasis">icp_hit_stale</span> directive increases the number of
false hits because Squid must validate the stale responses. Squid
normally handles false hits by adding the <TT>Cache-Control:
only-if-cached</TT> directive to HTTP requests sent to siblings.
If the sibling can't satisfy the HTTP request as a
cache hit, it returns an HTTP 504 (Gateway Timeout) message instead.
When Squid receives the 504 response, it forwards the request again,
but only to a parent or the origin server.</P>

<P class="docText">It makes little sense to enable <span class="docEmphasis">icp_hit_stale</span>
for sibling relationships if all the false hits must be reforwarded.
This is where the ICP client's
<TT>allow-miss</TT> option to
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_peer</span> becomes useful. When the
<TT>allow-miss</TT> option is set, Squid omits the
<TT>only-if-cached</TT> directive in HTTP requests it sends
to siblings.</P>

<P class="docText">If you enable <span class="docEmphasis">icp_hit_stale</span>, you also need to
make sure that <span class="docEmphasis">miss_access</span>
doesn't deny cache-miss requests from siblings.
Unfortunately, there is no way to make Squid allow only cache-misses
for cached, stale objects. Allowing cache misses for siblings also
leaves your cache open to potential abuse. The administrator of the
sibling cache may change it to a parent relationship without your
knowledge or permission.</P>

ICP clients that receive <TT>ICP_MISS_NOFETCH</TT>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">10.6.1.3 The test_reachability directive</H5>

<P class="docText">If you enable the <span class="docEmphasis">netdb</span> feature (see 
<A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10-SECT-5.html#squid-CHP-10-SECT-5">Section 10.5</A>), you might also
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1649"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1650"></A>be
interested in enabling the <span class="docEmphasis">test_reachability</span>
directive. The goal behind it is to accept only requests for origin
servers Squid can reach. Enabling
<span class="docEmphasis">test_reachability</span> causes Squid to return
<TT>ICP_MISS_NOFETCH</TT>, instead of
<TT>ICP_MISS</TT>, for origin server sites that
don't respond to ICMP pings. This can help reduce
the number of failed HTTP requests and increase the chance that the
end user receives the data promptly. However, a significant
percentage of origin server sites intentionally filter out ICMP
traffic. For these, Squid returns <TT>ICP_MISS_NOFETCH</TT>
even though an HTTP connection would succeed.</P>

<P class="docText">Enabling <span class="docEmphasis">test_reachability</span> also causes Squid to
make <span class="docEmphasis">netdb</span> measurements in response to ICP
queries. If Squid doesn't have any RTT measurements
for the origin server in question, it sends out an ICMP ping (subject
to the rate limiting mentioned previously).</P>

section <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10-SECT-3.html#squid-CHP-10-SECT-3">Section 10.3</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">Second, you must also use the <span class="docEmphasis">icp_port</span>
directive, even if your Squid is only an ICP client. This is because
Squid uses the same socket for sending and receiving ICP messages. It
is perhaps a bad design decision in retrospect. If you are a client
only, use <span class="docEmphasis">icp_access</span> to block queries. For
example:</P>

<PRE>acl All src 0/0
icp_access deny All</PRE>

<P class="docText">Squid sends ICP queries to its neighbors for most requests by
default. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10-SECT-10.html#squid-CHP-10-SECT-10">Section 10.10</A> for a complete description
of the way that Squid decides when, and when not, to query its
neighbors.</P>

<P class="docText">After sending one or more queries, Squid waits some amount of time
for ICP replies to arrive. If Squid receives an
<TT>ICP_HIT</TT> from one of its neighbors, it forwards the
request there immediately. Otherwise, Squid waits until all replies
arrive or until a timeout occurs. The timeout is calculated
dynamically, based on the following algorithm.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid knows the average round-trip time between itself and each
neighbor, taken from recent ICP transactions. When querying a group
of neighbors, Squid calculates the mean of all the neighbor ICP RTTs,
and then doubles it. In other words, the query timeout is twice the
mean of RTTs for each neighbor queried. Squid ignores neighbors that
appear to be down when calculating the timeout.</P>

<P class="docText">In some cases, the algorithm doesn't work well,
especially if you have neighbors with widely varying RTTs. You can
change the upper limit on the timeout using the
<span class="docEmphasis">maximum_icp_query_timeout</span> directive.
Alternatively, you can make Squid always use a constant timeout value
with the <span class="docEmphasis">icp_query_timeout</span> directive.</P>

<P class="docText">As you already know, ICP has <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1656"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1657"></A>poor scaling properties. The number of
messages is proportional to the number of neighbors. Because Squid
sends identical <TT>ICP_QUERY</TT> messages to each
neighbor, you can use multicast to reduce the number of messages
transmitted on the network. Rather than send <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>
messages to <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> neighbors, Squid sends one message
to a multicast address. The multicast routing infrastructure makes
sure each neighbor receives a copy of the message. See the book
<span class="docEmphasis">Interdomain Multicast Routing: Practical Juniper Networks
and Cisco Systems Solutions</span> by Brian M. Edwards, Leonard
A. Giuliano, and Brian R. Wright (Addison Wesley) for more
information on the inner workings of multicast.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that ICP replies are always sent via unicast. This is because
ICP replies may be different (e.g., hit versus miss) and because the
unicast and multicast routing topologies may differ. Because ICP is
also used to indicate network conditions, an ICP reply should follow
the same path an HTTP reply takes. The bottom line is that multicast
only reduces message counts for queries.</P>

<P class="docText">Historically, I've found multicast infrastructure
unstable and unreliable. It seems to be a low priority for many ISPs.
Even though it works one day, something may break a few days or weeks
later. You're probably safe using multicast entirely
within your own network, but I don't recommend using
it for ICP on the public Internet.</P>

that you need to be a little bit careful when selecting a multicast
group to use for ICP. You don't want to select an

that, unless you're careful, others may be able to

has two ways to prevent packets from traveling too far: TTLs and

administratively scoped address and properly configured routers. See

possibly be intercepted by outsiders. Use a lower number to keep the
queries close to the source and within your network.</P>

<P class="docText">Multicast ICP clients must also tell Squid about the neighbors that
will be responding to queries. Squid doesn't blindly
trust any cache that happens to send an ICP reply. You must tell
Squid about legitimate, trusted neighbors. The
<TT>multicast-responder</TT> option to
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_peer</span> identifies such neighbors. For
example, if you know that 172.16.2.3 is a trusted neighbor on the
multicast group, you should add this line to
<I>squid.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE>cache_peer 172.16.3.2 parent 3128 3130 multicast-responder</PRE>

<P class="docText">You can, of course, use a hostname instead of an IP address. ICP
replies from foreign (unlisted) neighbors are ignored, but logged in
<I>cache.log</I>.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid normally expects to receive an ICP reply for each query that it
sends. This changes, however, with multicast because one query may
result in multiple replies. To account for this, Squid periodically
sends out "probes" on the multicast
group address. These probes tell Squid how many servers are out there
listening. Squid counts the number of replies that arrive within a
certain amount of time. That amount of time is given by the
<span class="docEmphasis">mcast_icp_query_timeout</span> directive. Then, when
Squid sends a real ICP query to the group, it adds this count to the
number of ICP replies to expect.</P>

<P class="docText">Since multicast ICP is tricky, here's
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1665"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1666"></A>another
example. Let's say your ISP has three parent caches
that listen on a multicast address for ICP queries. The ISP needs
only one line in its configuration file:</P>

<PRE>mcast_groups 224.0.14.255</PRE>

<P class="docText">The configuration for you (the child cache) is a little more
complicated. First, you must list the multicast neighbor to which
Squid should send queries. You must also list the three parent caches
with their unicast addresses so that Squid accepts their replies:</P>

<PRE>cache_peer 224.0.14.225 multicast 3128 3130 ttl=16
cache_peer parent1.yourisp.net parent 3128 3130 multicast-responder
cache_peer parent2.yourisp.net parent 3128 3130 multicast-responder
cache_peer parent3.yourisp.net parent 3128 3130 multicast-responder
mcast_icp_query_timeout 2 sec</PRE>

<P class="docText">Keep in mind that Squid never makes HTTP requests to
<TT>multicast</TT> neighbors, and it never sends ICP
queries to <TT>multicast-responder</TT> neighbors.</P>
