<P class="docText">One of the most common <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1667"></A>complaints about ICP is the additional
delay added for each request. In many cases, Squid waits for all ICP
replies to arrive before making a forwarding decision.
Squid's Cache Digest feature offers similar
functionality but without per-request network delays.</P>

<P class="docText">Cache Digests are based on a technique first published by Pei Cao,
called Summary Cache. The fundamental idea is to
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1668"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1669"></A>use a
Bloom filter to represent the cache contents. Neighboring caches
download each other's Bloom filters, or digests in
this terminology. Then, they can query the digest to determine
whether or not a particular URI is in the neighbor's
cache.</P>

<P class="docText">Compared to ICP, Cache Digests trade time for space. Whereas ICP
queries incur time penalties (latency), digests incur space (memory,
disk) penalties. In Squid, a neighbor's digest is
stored entirely in memory. A typical digest requires about 625 KB of
memory for every million objects.</P>

<P class="docText">The Bloom filter is an interesting data structure that provides lossy
encoding of a collection of items. The filter itself is simply a
large array of bits. Given a Bloom filter (and the parameters used to
generate it), you can find, with some uncertainty, if a particular
item is in the collection. In Squid, items are URIs, and the digest
is sized at 5 bits per cached object. For example, you can represent
the collection of 1,000,000 cached objects with a filter of 5,000,000
bits, or 625,000 bytes.</P>

<P class="docText">Due to their nature, Bloom filters aren't a perfect
representation of the collection. They sometimes incorrectly indicate
that a particular item is present in the collection because two or
more items may turn on the same bit. In other words, the filter can
indicate that object <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> is in the cache, even
though <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> was never cached or requested. These
false positives occur with a certain probability you can control by
adjusting the parameters of the filter. For example, increasing the
number of bits per object decreases the false positive probability.
See my O'Reilly book, <span class="docEmphasis">Web
Caching</span>, for many more details about Cache Digests.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.7.1 Configuring Squid for Cache Digests</H4>

<P class="docText">First of all, you must compile
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1670"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1671"></A>Squid with the Cache Digest code enabled.
Simply add the <I>—enable-cache-digests</I> option
when running <I>./configure</I>. Taking this step causes
two things to happen when you run Squid:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Your Squid cache generates a digest of its own contents. Your
neighbors may request this digest if they are also configured to use
Cache Digests.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Your Squid requests a Cache Digest from each of its neighbors.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">If you don't want to request digests for a
particular neighbor, use the <TT>no-digest</TT> option on
the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_peer</span> line. For example:</P>

<PRE>cache_peer neighbor.host.name parent 3128 3130 no-digest</PRE>

<P class="docText">Squid stores its own digest under the following URL: <span class="docEmphasis">http://my.host.name:port/squid-internal-periodic/store_digest</span>.
When Squid requests a neighbor's digest, it simply
requests <span class="docEmphasis">http://neighbor.host.name:port/squid-internal-periodic/store_digest</span>.
Obviously, this naming scheme is specific to Squid. If you have a
non-Squid neighbor that supports Cache Digests, you may need to tell
your Squid that the neighbor's digest has a
different address. The <TT>digest-url=url</TT> option to
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_peer</span> allows you to configure the URL for
the neighbor's Cache Digest. For example:</P>

<PRE>cache_peer neighbor.host.name parent 3128 3130 digest-url=http://blah/digest</PRE>

<P class="docText"><I>squid.conf</I> has a number of directives that
control the way in which Squid generates its own Cache Digest. First,
the <span class="docEmphasis">digest_generation</span> directive controls whether
or not Squid generates a digest of its cache. You might want to
disable digest generation if your cache is a child to a parent, but
not a parent or sibling to any other caches. The remaining directives
control low-level underlying details of digest generation. You should
change them only if you fully understand the Cache Digest
implementation.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">digest_bits_per_entry</span> determines the size of
the digest. The default value is 5. Increasing the value results in
larger digests (consuming more memory and bandwidth) and lower
false-hit probabilities. A lower setting results in smaller digests
and more false hits. I feel that the default setting is a very nice
tradeoff. A setting of 3 or lower has too many false hits to be
useful, and a setting of 8 or higher simply wastes bandwidth.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid uses a two-step process to create a cache digest. First, it
builds the cache digest data structure. This is basically a large
Bloom filter and small header that contains the digest parameters.
Once the data structure is filled, Squid creates a cached HTTP
response for the digest. This simply involves prepending some HTTP
headers and storing the response on disk with the other cached
responses.</P>

<P class="docText">A Cache Digest represents a snapshot in time of the
cache's contents. The
<span class="docEmphasis">digest_rebuild_period</span> controls how frequently
Squid rebuilds the digest data structure (but not the HTTP response).
The default is once per hour. More frequent rebuilds mean
Squid's digest is more up to date, at the expense of
higher CPU utilization. The rebuild procedure is relatively
CPU-intensive. Your users may experience a slowdown while Squid
rebuilds its digest.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage</span> directive
controls how much of the cache to add to the digest each time the
rebuild procedure is called. The default is 10%. During each
invocation of the rebuild function, Squid adds some percentage of the
cache to the digest. Squid doesn't process user
requests while this function runs. After adding the specified
percentage, the function reschedules itself and then exits so that
Squid can process normal HTTP requests. After processing pending
requests, Squid returns to the rebuild function and adds another
chunk of the cache to the digest. Decreasing this value should give
better response time to your users, while increasing the total time
needed to rebuild the digest.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">digest_rewrite_period</span> directive controls how
often Squid creates an HTTP response from the digest data structure.
In most cases, this should match the
<span class="docEmphasis">digest_rebuild_period</span> value. The default is one
hour. The rewrite procedure consists of numerous calls to a function
that simply appends some amount of the digest data structure to the
cache entry (as though Squid were reading an origin server response
from the network). Each time this function is called, Squid appends
<span class="docEmphasis">digest_swapout_chunk_size</span> bytes of the digest.</P>
