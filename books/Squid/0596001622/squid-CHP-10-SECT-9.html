<H3 class="docSection1Title">10.9 Cache Array Routing Protocol</H3>

<P class="docText">CARP is an algorithm <A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1676"></A>that partitions
<I>URI-space</I> among a group of caching proxies. In
other words, each URI is assigned to one of the caches. CARP
maximizes hit ratios and minimizes duplication of objects among the
group of caches. The protocol consists of two major components: a
Routing Function and a Proxy Array Membership Table. Unlike ICP,
HTCP, and Cache Digests, CARP can't predict whether
a particular request will be a cache hit. Thus, you
can't use CARP with siblings—only parents.</P>

<P class="docText">The basic idea behind CARP is that you have a group, or array, of
parent caches to handle all the load from users or child caches. A
cache array is one way to handle ever-increasing loads. You can add
more array members whenever you need more capacity. CARP is a
deterministic algorithm. That is, the same request always goes to the
same array member (as long as the array size doesn't
change). Unlike ICP and HTCP, CARP doesn't use query
messages.</P>

<P class="docText">Another interesting thing about CARP is that you have the choice to
deploy it in a number of different places. For example, one approach
is to make all user-agents execute the CARP algorithm. You could
probably accomplish this with a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC)
function, written in JavaScript (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-F.html#squid-APP-F">Appendix F</A>).
However, you're likely to have certain web agents on
your network that don't implement or support PAC
files. Another option is to use a two-level cache hierarchy. The
lower level (child caches) accept requests from all user-agents, and
they execute the CARP algorithm to select the parent cache for each
request. However, unless your network is very large, many caches can
be more of a burden than a benefit. Finally, you can also implement
CARP within the array itself. That is, user-agents connect to a
random member of the cache array, but each member forwards cache
misses to another member of the array based on the CARP algorithm.</P>

<P class="docText">CARP was designed to be better than a simple hashing algorithm, which
typically works by applying a hash function, such as MD5, to URIs.
The algorithm then calculates the modulus for the number of array
members. It might be as simple as this pseudocode:</P>

<PRE>N = MD5(URI) % num_caches;
next_hop = Caches[N];</PRE>

<P class="docText">This technique uniformly spreads the URIs among all the caches. It
also provides a consistent mapping (maximizing cache hits), as long
as the number of caches remains constant. When caches are added or
removed, however, this algorithm changes the mapping for most of the
URIs.</P>

<P class="docText">CARP's Routing Function improves on this technique
in two ways. First, it allows for unequal sharing of the load. For
example, you can configure one parent to receive twice as many
requests as another. Second, adding or removing array members
minimizes the fraction of URIs that get reassigned.</P>

<P class="docText">The downside to CARP is that it is relatively CPU-intensive. For each
request, Squid calculates a "score"
for each parent. The request is sent to the parent cache with the
highest score. The complexity of the algorithm is proportional to the
number of parents. In other words, CPU load increases in proportion
to the number of CARP parents. However, the calculations in CARP have
been designed to be faster than, say, MD5, and other cryptographic
hash functions.</P>

<P class="docText">In addition to the load-sharing algorithm, CARP also has a protocol
component. The Membership Table has a well-defined structure and
syntax so that all clients of a single array can have the same
configuration. If some clients are configured differently, CARP
becomes less useful because not all clients send the same request to
the same parent. Note that Squid doesn't currently
implement the Membership Table feature.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid's CARP implementation is lacking in another
way. The protocol says that if a request can't be
forwarded to the highest-scoring parent cache, it should be sent to
the second-highest-scoring member. If that also fails, the
application should give up. Squid currently uses only the
highest-scoring parent cache.</P>

<P class="docText">CARP was originally documented as an Internet Draft in 1998, which is
now expired. It was developed by Vinod Valloppillil of Microsoft and
Keith W. Ross of the University of Pennsylvania. With a little
searching, you can still find the old document out there on the
Internet. You may even be able to find some documentation on the
Microsoft sites. You can also find more information on CARP in my
O'Reilly book <span class="docEmphasis">Web Caching</span>.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">10.9.1 Configuring Squid for CARP</H4>

<P class="docText">To use CARP in Squid, you must
<A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1677"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-10-ITERM-1678"></A>first run the
<I>./configure</I> script with the
<I>—enable-carp</I> option. Next, you must add
<TT>carp-load-factor</TT> options to the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_peer</span> lines for parents that are members of
the array. The following is an example.</P>

<PRE>cache_peer neighbor1.host.name parent 3128 0 carp-load-factor=0.3
cache_peer neighbor2.host.name parent 3128 0 carp-load-factor=0.3
cache_peer neighbor3.host.name parent 3128 0 carp-load-factor=0.4</PRE>

<P class="docText">Note that all <TT>carp-load-factor</TT> values must add up
to 1.0. Squid checks for this condition and complains if it finds a
discrepancy. Additionally, the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_peer</span> lines
must be listed in order of increasing load factor values. Only recent
versions of Squid check that this condition is true.</P>

<P class="docText">Remember that CARP is treated somewhat specially with regard to a
neighbor's alive/dead state. Squid normally declares
a neighbor dead (and ceases sending requests to it) after 10 failed
connections. In the case of CARP, however, Squid skips a parent that
has one or more failed connections. Once Squid is working with CARP,
you can monitor it with the <I>carp</I> cache manager
page. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-14-SECT-2.html#squid-CHP-14-SECT-2.1.49">Section 14.2.1.49</A> for more information.</P>
