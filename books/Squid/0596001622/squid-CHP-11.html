<P class="docText">A <I>redirector</I> is an external process that
<A NAME="squid-CHP-11-ITERM-1689"></A>rewrites
URIs from client requests. For example, although a user requests the
page <span class="docEmphasis">http://www.example.com/page1.html</span>, a
redirector can change the request to something else, such as
<span class="docEmphasis">http://www.example.com/page2.html</span>. Squid
fetches the new URI automatically, as though the client originally
requested it. If the response is cachable, Squid stores it under the
new URI.</P>

<P class="docText">The redirector feature allows you to implement a number of
interesting things with Squid. Many sites use them for access
controls, removing advertisements, local mirrors, or even working
around browser bugs.</P>

<P class="docText">One of the nice things about using a <A NAME="squid-CHP-11-ITERM-1690"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-11-ITERM-1691"></A>redirector for access control is
that you can send the user to a page that explains exactly why her
request is denied. You may also find that a redirector offers more
flexibility than Squid's built-in access controls.
As you'll see shortly, however, a redirector
doesn't have access to the full spectrum of
information contained in a client's request.</P>

<P class="docText">Many people use a redirector to
<A NAME="squid-CHP-11-ITERM-1692"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-11-ITERM-1693"></A>filter out web page advertisements. In most
cases, this involves changing a request for a GIF or JPEG
advertisement image into a request for a small, blank image, located
on a local server. Thus, the advertisement just
"disappears" and
doesn't interfere with the page layout.</P>

<P class="docText">So in essence, a redirector is really just a program that reads a URI
and other information from its input and writes a new URI on its
output. Perl and Python are popular languages for redirectors,
although some authors use compiled languages such as C for better
performance.</P>

<P class="docText">The Squid source code doesn't come with any
redirector programs. As an administrator, you are responsible for
writing your own or downloading one written by someone else. The
first part of this chapter describes the interface between Squid and
a redirector process. I also provide a couple of simple redirector
examples in Perl. If you're interested in using
someone else's redirector, rather than programming
your own, skip ahead to <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-11-SECT-3.html#squid-CHP-11-SECT-3">Section 11.3</A>.</P>
