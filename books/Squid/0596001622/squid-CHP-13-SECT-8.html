<P class="docText">Squid's log files, especially
<I>access.log</I>, contain a
<A NAME="squid-CHP-13-ITERM-1923"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-13-ITERM-1924"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-13-ITERM-1925"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-13-ITERM-1926"></A>record of
users' activities and, hence, are subject to privacy
concerns. As the Squid administrator, you should take every
precaution to keep the log files safe and secure. One of the best
ways to do that is limit the number of people who have access to the
system on which Squid runs. If that isn't possible,
carefully examine the file and directory permissions to make sure
they can't be viewed by untrusted or unauthorized
users.</P>

<P class="docText">You can also help protect your users' privacy by
taking advantage of the <span class="docEmphasis">client_netmask</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">strip_query_terms</span> directives. The former makes
it harder to identify individual users in the
<I>access.log</I>; the latter removes URI query terms
that may contain personal information. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-13-SECT-2.html#squid-CHP-13-SECT-2.4">Section 13.2.4</A> for more information.</P>

<P class="docText">You may also want to develop a policy for keeping old log files.
Obviously <I>access.log</I> helps keep users
accountable for their activities, but how far back would you ever
need to go searching for something? A week? A year? What would you do
if presented with a court order to hand over your log files for the
last three months?</P>

<P class="docText">If you like to keep historical data for a long time, perhaps you can
make the log files anonymous or somehow reduce the dataset. If you
are interested only in which URIs were accessed, but not by whom, you
can extract only that field from <I>access.log</I>.
This not only makes the file smaller, it also reduces the risk of a
privacy violation. Another technique is to randomize the client IP
addresses. In other words, create a filter that maps real IP
addresses to fake ones, such that the same real address is always
changed to the same fake address. If you are using RFC 1413
identification or HTTP authentication, consider making those fields
anonymous as well.</P>
