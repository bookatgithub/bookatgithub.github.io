<H3 class="docSection1Title">14.1 cache.log Warnings</H3>

<P class="docText">This is one of the first places you
<A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1933"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1934"></A>should
look whenever you perceive a problem with Squid. During normal
operation, you'll find various warnings and
informational messages that may or may not indicate a problem. I
covered the mechanics of <I>cache.log</I> back in <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-13-SECT-1.html#squid-CHP-13-SECT-1">Section 13.1</A>. Here, I'll go over a few of
the warning messages you might see in your log file.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">high_response_time_warning</span> directive
<A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1935"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1936"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1937"></A>makes Squid print a warning whenever the
median response time exceeds a threshold. The value is in
milliseconds and is disabled by default. If you add this line to
<I>squid.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE>high_response_time_warning 1500</PRE>

<P class="docText">Squid will print the following warning if the median response time,
measured over a 1-minute interval, exceeds 1.5 seconds:</P>

<PRE>2003/09/29 03:17:31| WARNING: Median response time is 2309 milliseconds</PRE>

<P class="docText">Before setting this directive, you should have a good idea of
Squid's normal response time levels. If you set it
too low, you'll get false alarms. In this particular
example, it means that half of your user's requests
take more than 2.3 second to complete. High response times may be
caused by local problems, such as running out of file descriptors, or
by remote problems, such as a severely congested Internet link.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">high_page_fault_warning</span>
directive<A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1938"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1939"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1940"></A> is similar. It causes Squid to
emit a warning if the number of page faults per minute exceeds a
given value. A high page-fault rate usually indicates that the Squid
process can't fit entirely in memory and must be
swapped out to disk. This swapping severely impacts
Squid's performance, so you should remedy the
situation as soon as possible, as I'll discuss in
<A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.html#squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.8">Section 16.1.8</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid uses the Unix <I>getrusage( )</I> function to
<A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1941"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1942"></A>get page fault counts. On some
operating systems (e.g., Solaris), the page fault counter represents
something besides swapping. Therefore, the
<span class="docEmphasis">high_page_fault_warning</span> may cause false alarms
on those systems.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">high_memory_warning</span> directive is
<A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1943"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1944"></A>also similar to the previously mentioned
warnings. In this case, it checks the size of the Squid process; if
it exceeds the threshold, you get the warning in
<I>cache.log</I>. On some operating systems, the
process size can only grow and never shrink. Therefore,
you'll constantly get this warning until Squid shuts
down.</P>

<P class="docText">Process size information comes from either the <I>mallinfo(
)</I>, <I>mstats( )</I>, or <I>sbrk(
)</I> functions. If these are unavailable on your operating
system, the <span class="docEmphasis">high_memory_warning</span> warning
won't work.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid has a number of
<A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1945"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-14-ITERM-1946"></A>other hardcoded warnings you
may see in <I>cache.log</I>:</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docMonofont">DNS lookup for 'neighbor.host.name' failed!</span></span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This occurs whenever Squid fails to look up the IP address for a
cache neighbor. Squid refreshes the neighbor addresses every hour or
so. As long as the neighbor's address is unknown,
Squid doesn't send any traffic there.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docMonofont">Detected DEAD Sibling: neighbor.host.name/3128/3130</span></span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Squid logs this message when it believes it can't
communicate with a neighbor cache. This happens, for example, when
too many consecutive ICP queries go unacknowledged. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10-SECT-3.html#squid-CHP-10-SECT-3.2">Section 10.3.2</A> for more information.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docMonofont">95% of replies from 'neighbor.host.name' are UDP_DENIED</span></span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This message indicates that a neighbor cache is refusing to answer
Squid's queries. It probably means that you are
sending queries to the neighbor without their permission. If they are
using address-based access controls, and you have recently changed
your address, they won't know about the change.
Squid refuses to send any more queries to the neighbor after
detecting this condition.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docMonofont">Probable misconfigured neighbor at 192.168.121.5</span></span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This occurs when you have an unauthorized cache client sending you
ICP or HTCP queries. The best thing to do in this case is try to find
out the person or organization responsible for the given address. Ask
why they are querying your cache.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docMonofont">Forwarding loop detected for</span></span>:</span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Recall that a forwarding loop occurs when a single request flows
through Squid a second time. The request's
<TT>Via</TT> header contains a list of all proxies that
have seen the request. If Squid detects its own name in the
<TT>Via</TT> list, it emits the forwarding loop warning and
sends the request directly to the origin server. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10-SECT-2.html#squid-CHP-10-SECT-2">Section 10.2</A> for an explanation of forwarding loops.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docMonofont">Closing client 192.168.121.5 connection due to lifetime timeout</span></span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">client_lifetime</span> directive places an upper
limit on the duration for a single HTTP request. Squid warns you when
such a request is terminated because it may indicate someone is
abusing your cache with very long-lived connections, for example, by
downloading infinitely long objects.</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">As you can see, <I>cache.log</I> provides only
notification of abnormal events. For periodic monitoring, you need
something else. The cache manager is perhaps the best choice, even
though its interface is less than perfect.</P>
