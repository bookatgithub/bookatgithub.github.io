<P class="docText">Using Squid as a surrogate may improve your origin
server's security and performance. However, there
are some potentially negative side effects as well. Here are a few
things to keep in mind.</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-SECT-6.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.6.1 Logging</H4>

<P class="docText">When using a surrogate, the <A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2110"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2111"></A>origin
server's access log contains only the cache misses
from Squid. Furthermore, those log-file entries have
Squid's IP address, rather than the
client's. In other words, Squid's
<I>access.log</I> is where all the good information is
now stored.</P>

<P class="docText">Recall that, by default, Squid doesn't use the
common log-file format. You should use the
<span class="docEmphasis">emulate_httpd_log</span> directive to make
Squid's <I>access.log</I> look just
like Apache's default log-file format.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-SECT-6.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.6.2 Ignoring Reloads</H4>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">Reload</span> button found on
<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2112"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2113"></A>most
browsers generates HTTP requests with the
<TT>Cache-Control</TT>: <TT>no-cache</TT>
directive set. While this is usually desirable for client-side
caching proxies, it may ruin the performance of a surrogate. This is
especially true if the backend server is heavily loaded. A reload
request forces Squid to purge the currently cached response while
retrieving the new response from the origin server. If those origin
server responses arrive slowly, Squid consumes a larger than normal
number of file descriptors and network resources.</P>

<P class="docText">To help in this situation, you may want to use one of the
<span class="docEmphasis">refresh_pattern</span> options. When the
<TT>ignore-reload</TT> option is set, Squid pretends that
the request doesn't contain the
<TT>no-cache</TT> directive. The
<TT>ignore-reload</TT> option is generally safe for
surrogates, although it does, technically, violate the HTTP protocol.</P>

<P class="docText">To make Squid ignore reloads for all requests, use a line like this
in <I>squid.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE>refresh_pattern . 0 20% 4320 ignore-reload</PRE>

<P class="docText">For a somewhat safer alternative, you can use the
<TT>reload-into-ims</TT> option. It causes Squid to
validate its cached response when the request contains
<TT>no-cache</TT>. Note, however, that this works only for
responses that have cache validators (such as
<TT>Last-Modified</TT> timestamps).</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-SECT-6.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.6.3 Uncachable Content</H4>

<P class="docText">As a surrogate, Squid obeys<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2114"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2115"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2116"></A> the standard HTTP headers for
caching responses from your backend server. This means, for example,
that certain dynamic responses might not be cached. You might want to
use the <span class="docEmphasis">refresh_pattern</span> directive to force
caching of these objects. For example:</P>

<PRE>refresh_pattern \.dhtml$ 60 80% 180</PRE>

<P class="docText">This trick only works for certain types of responses, namely, those
without a <TT>Last-Modified</TT> or
<TT>Expires</TT> header. By default, Squid
doesn't cache such responses. However, using a
nonzero minimum time in a <span class="docEmphasis">refresh_pattern</span> rule
instructs Squid to cache the response, and serve it as a cache hit
for that amount of time anyway. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-7.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-7">Section 7.7</A> for
the details.</P>

<P class="docText">If your backend server generates other types of uncachable responses,
you may not be able to trick Squid into storing them.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-SECT-6.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.6.4 Errors</H4>

<P class="docText">With Squid as a surrogate <A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2117"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2118"></A>in
front of your origin server, you should be aware that visitors to
your site may see an error message from Squid, rather than the origin
server itself. In other words, your use of Squid may be
"exposed" through certain error
messages. For example, Squid returns its own error message when it
fails to parse the client's HTTP request, which
could happen if the request is incomplete or is malformed in some
way. Squid also returns an error message if it can't
connect to the backend server for some reason.</P>

<P class="docText">If your site is consistent and functioning properly, you probably
don't need to worry about Squid's
error messages. Nonetheless, you may want to take a close look at the
<I>access.log</I> from time to time and see what sort
of errors, if any, your users might be seeing.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-SECT-6.5"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.6.5 Purging Objects</H4>

<P class="docText">You may find the <TT>PURGE</TT> method
<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2119"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2120"></A>particularly useful when
operating a surrogate. Because you have a good understanding of the
content being served, you are more likely to know when a cached
object must be purged. The technique for purging an object is the
same as I mentioned previously. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-6.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-6">Section 7.6</A> for
a refresher.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">15.6.6 Neighbors</H4>

<P class="docText">Although I don't recommend it, you
<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2121"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2122"></A>can
configure Squid as a surrogate and as part of a mesh or hierarchy. If
you choose to take on such an arrangement, note that, by default,
Squid forwards cache misses to parents (rather than the backend
server). Assuming that isn't what you really want,
be sure to use the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_peer_access</span> directives
so that requests for your backend server don't go to
your neighbors instead.</P>
