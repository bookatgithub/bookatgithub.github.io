<H2 class="docChapterTitle">Chapter 15. Server Accelerator Mode</H2>


<P class="docText">Throughout most of this book, I've been talking
about Squid as a client-side caching proxy. However, with just a few
special <I>squid.conf</I> settings, Squid is able to
function as an origin server <A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2081"></A>accelerator as well. In this mode,
it accepts normal HTTP requests and forwards cache misses to the real
origin server (or <I>backend server</I>). In the
parlance of RFC 3040, Squid is operating as a
<I>surrogate</I>. This configuration is similar to
what I talked about in <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-9.html#squid-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>. The primary
difference is that, as a surrogate, Squid accepts requests for one,
or maybe a few, origin server(s), rather than any and all origins.
HTTP interception isn't required for server
acceleration.</P>

<P class="docText">As the name implies, server acceleration is
<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2082"></A>generally used as a technique
to improve the performance of slow, or heavily loaded, backend
servers. It works well because origin servers tend to have a
relatively small hot set. Most likely, the objects responsible for
90% of origin server traffic can fit entirely in memory. Depending on
your particular backend server software and configuration, Squid may
be able to serve requests much faster.</P>

<P class="docText">Security is another good reason
<A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2083"></A>to consider Squid as a surrogate. Think of
Squid as a dedicated firewall in front of your origin server. The
Squid source code is too large to be trusted as completely secure.
However, you may sleep better with Squid protecting your backend
server. It is simply a cache, so it doesn't
permanently store the source of your data. If the Squid box is
attacked or compromised, you won't lose any data.
You may find it easier to secure a system running Squid than the
system running your backend server application(s).</P>

<P class="docText">You might also be interested in server acceleration to implement load
balancing. If your origin server runs on expensive boxes, you can
save money by deploying Squid on a number of cheaper boxes. By
placing Squid at a number of different locations, you can even build
your own <A NAME="squid-CHP-15-ITERM-2084"></A>content delivery network (CDN).</P>
