<H3 class="docSection1Title">16.1 Some Common Problems</H3>

<P class="docText">Before discussing debugging in general, I'll mention
a few specific problems that commonly arise.</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.1 "Failed to make swap directory"</H4>

<PRE>Failed to make swap directory /var/spool/cache: (13) Permission denied</PRE>

<P class="docText">This happens when you
<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2123"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2124"></A>run <I>squid
-z</I>, and the Squid user ID doesn't have
write permission to the <I>/var/spool</I> directory.
Remember that if you start Squid as <span class="docEmphasis">root</span> and
don't add a
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_effective_user</span> line, Squid runs as the
user <span class="docEmphasis">nobody</span> by default. Thus, your solution may
be to simply run:</P>

<PRE># chown nobody:nobody /var/spool</PRE>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.2 "Address already in use"</H4>

<PRE>commBind: Cannot bind socket FD 10 to *:3128: Address already in use</PRE>

<P class="docText">This message appears <A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2125"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2126"></A>when the <I>bind( )</I> system call fails because the requested port is already
opened by another application. Usually, this happens when you try to
start a second instance of Squid when the first one is still running.
If you see this error message, use <I>ps</I> to see if
Squid is already running.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid uses the <TT>SO_REUSEADDR</TT> socket option, so that
the <I>bind( )</I> call should succeed even if there
are some leftover sockets in the TIME_WAIT state. If you get the
message, even though Squid isn't already running,
your operating system may be buggy or especially finicky. Rebooting
your system is one way to get around this problem.</P>

<P class="docText">Another possibility to consider is that the port (e.g., 3128) is
currently being used by a different application. If you suspect this,
you can use the <I>lsof</I> program (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="ftp://lsof.itap.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof">ftp://lsof.itap.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof</A>)
to find which application is listening on the port. FreeBSD users can
use <I>sockstat</I> instead.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.3 "Could not determine fully qualified hostname"</H4>

<PRE>FATAL: Could not determine fully qualified hostname.  Please set 'visible_hostname'</PRE>

<P class="docText">You'll see this if Squid
<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2127"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2128"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2129"></A>can't figure out its own
fully qualified domain name. Here is the algorithm Squid uses:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">If you told Squid to bind the HTTP port to a specific interface
address, Squid attempts a reverse DNS lookup of that address. If
successful, the answer is used.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Squid calls the <I>gethostname( )</I> function, and
then attempts to resolve its IP address with <I>gethostbyname( )</I>. If successful, Squid uses the official hostname string
returned by the latter function.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">If neither technique works, Squid exits with the fatal message shown
earlier. In this case, you must tell Squid its hostname with the
<span class="docEmphasis">visible_hostname</span> directive. For example:</P>

<PRE>visible_hostname my.host.name</PRE>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.4"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.4 "DNS name lookup tests failed"</H4>

<P class="docText">By default, Squid makes a few DNS
<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2130"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2131"></A>queries before
starting. This ensures that your DNS servers are reachable and
functioning properly. If these tests fail, you'll
see the following message in <I>cache.log</I> and/or
syslog:</P>

<PRE>FATAL: ipcache_init: DNS name lookup tests failed</PRE>

<P class="docText">If you use Squid on an intranet, Squid may be unable to query its
standard list of hostnames. You can specify your own hostnames with
the <span class="docEmphasis">dns_testnames</span> directive. Squid considers the
DNS test successful as soon as it receives any reply.</P>

<P class="docText">If you want to skip the DNS tests altogether, simply use the
<I>-D</I> command-line option when starting Squid:</P>

<PRE>% squid -D ...</PRE>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.5"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.5 "Illegal character in hostname"</H4>

<PRE>urlParse: Illegal character in hostname 'super_bikes.tripod.com'</PRE>

<P class="docText">By default, Squid checks the characters in
<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2132"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2133"></A>the hostname part of URLs and complains if
it finds nonstandard characters. According to RFCs 1034 and 1035,
names must consist of the letters A-Z, the digits 0-9, and a hyphen
(<TT>-</TT>). The underscore (_) is one of the most
problematic characters.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid validates hostnames because, in some cases, DNS resolvers
behave differently with respect to illegal characters. For example:</P>

<PRE>% host super_bikes.tripod.com
super_bikes.tripod.com has address 209.202.196.70

% ping super_bikes.tripod.com
ping: cannot resolve super_bikes.tripod.com: Unknown server error</PRE>

<P class="docText">Rather than return the <TT>Unknown</TT>
<TT>server</TT> <TT>error</TT> message, Squid
checks the hostname first. It can then tell the user when the
hostname contains illegal characters.</P>

<P class="docText">Some DNS resolvers do work with underscores and other nonstandard
characters. If you'd prefer that Squid not check
hostnames, use the <I>—disable-hostname-checks</I>
option when running <I>./configure</I>. If you want to
allow underscores as the only exception, use the
<I>—enable-underscores</I> option.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.6"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.6 "Running out of filedescriptors"</H4>

<PRE>WARNING! Your cache is running out of filedescriptors</PRE>

<P class="docText">The above message appears when
<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2134"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2135"></A>Squid uses up all available file
descriptors. If this happens under normal conditions, you need to
increase the kernel's file-descriptor limits and
recompile Squid. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-3-SECT-3.html#squid-CHP-3-SECT-3.1">Section 3.3.1</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">You might also see this message if Squid is the target of a
denial-of-service attack. Someone may be intentionally, or
unintentionally, sending Squid hundreds or thousands of requests at
once. If this is the case, you can probably add a packet-filtering
rule to block incoming TCP connections from the offending
address(es). If the attack is distributed or using a spoofed source
address, you'll have a harder time stopping it.</P>

<P class="docText">Forwarding loops (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10-SECT-2.html#squid-CHP-10-SECT-2">Section 10.2</A>) might also
consume all of Squid's file descriptors, but only if
Squid can't detect the loop. The
<TT>Via</TT> header contains the hostname of all proxies
that have seen a particular request. Squid looks for its own hostname
in the header, and, if found, reports the loop. If, for some reason,
the <TT>Via</TT> header is filtered from outgoing or
incoming HTTP requests, Squid can't detect the loop.
In this case, all file descriptors are quickly consumed by the same
request going through Squid over and over.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.7"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.7 "icmpRecv: Connection refused"</H4>

<P class="docText">You'll see the following message if
<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2136"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2137"></A>the <I>pinger</I> program
isn't correctly installed:</P>

<PRE>icmpRecv: recv: (61) Connection refused</PRE>

<P class="docText">Most likely, the <I>pinger</I> program exits immediately
because it doesn't have permission to open a raw
ICMP socket. Because the process isn't running,
Squid receives an I/O error when trying to talk to it. To alleviate
the problem, go to the source directory and, as
<span class="docEmphasis">root</span>, type:</P>

<PRE># make install-pinger</PRE>

<P class="docText">If successful, you should find that the <I>pinger</I>
program has the following file ownership and permission settings:</P>

<PRE># ls -l /usr/local/squid/libexec/pinger
-rws--x--x  1 root  squid  140728 Sep 16 19:58 /usr/local/squid/libexec/pinger</PRE>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.8"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.8 Squid Becomes Slow After Running for Some Time</H4>

<P class="docText">Most likely, Squid is competing with <A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2138"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2139"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2140"></A>other processes, or with itself, for memory
on your system. When the Squid process no longer fits entirely in
memory, the operating system is forced to read and write areas of
memory to and from the swap space. This has a drastic effect on
Squid's performance.</P>

<P class="docText">To validate this theory, check the Squid process size with utilities
such as <I>top</I> and <I>ps</I>. Also check
Squid's own page fault counter, as described in
<A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-14-SECT-2.html#squid-CHP-14-SECT-2.1.24">Section 14.2.1.24</A>. Once you've identified
memory consumption as the problem, try the following steps to reduce
Squid's memory usage:</P>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Reduce the value of <span class="docEmphasis">cache_mem</span> and read <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-B.html#squid-APP-B">Appendix B</A>.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Turn off memory pooling with this option:</P><PRE>memory_pools off</PRE></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Reduce the size of the disk cache by lowering the size of one or more
cache directories. See <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-1">Section 7.1</A>.</P></span></LI></OL></span>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-SECT-1.9"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">16.1.9 Debugging Access Controls</H4>

<P class="docText">If you're having no luck getting
<A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2141"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-16-ITERM-2142"></A>your access controls to work
properly, here's a little tip that might help. Edit
your <I>squid.conf</I> file and set the
<span class="docEmphasis">debug_options</span> line to this:</P>

<PRE>debug_options ALL,1 33,2</PRE>

<P class="docText">Then, reconfigure Squid:</P>

<PRE>% squid -k reconfigure</PRE>

<P class="docText">Now, Squid writes a message to <I>cache.log</I> for
each client request and another for each reply. The messages contain
the request method, URI, whether the request/reply is allowed or
denied, and the name of the last ACL that matched it. For example:</P>

<PRE>2003/09/29 20:22:05| The request
    GET http://images.slashdot.org:80/topics/topicprivacy.gif is ALLOWED,
    because it matched 'localhost'
2003/09/29 20:22:05| The reply for
    GET http://images.slashdot.org/topics/topicprivacy.gif is ALLOWED,
    because it matched 'all'</PRE>

<P class="docText">Knowing the name of the ACL doesn't always tell you
the corresponding <span class="docEmphasis">http_access</span> line, but it gets
you pretty close. If necessary, you can replicate your
<span class="docEmphasis">acl</span> lines and give them unique names so that a
given ACL name appears on only one <span class="docEmphasis">http_access</span>
rule.</P>
