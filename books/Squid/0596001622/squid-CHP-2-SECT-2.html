<P class="docText">So why can't you just copy a precompiled binary to
your system and expect it to work perfectly? The primary reason is
that the code needs to know about certain operating system
parameters. In particular, the most important parameter is the
maximum number of open file descriptors. Squid's
<I>./configure</I> script (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-3-SECT-4.html#squid-CHP-3-SECT-4">Section 3.4</A>) probes for these values before compiling. If
you take a Squid binary built for one value and run it on a system
with a different value, you may encounter problems.</P>

<P class="docText">Another reason is that many of Squid's features must
be enabled at compile time. If you take a binary that somebody else
compiled, and it doesn't include the code for the
features that you want, you'll need to compile your
own version anyway.</P>

<P class="docText">Finally, note that shared libraries <A NAME="squid-CHP-2-ITERM-1129"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-2-ITERM-1130"></A>sometimes make it difficult to share
executable files between systems. Shared libraries are loaded at
runtime. This is also known as <span class="docEmphasis">dynamic linking</span>.
Squid's <I>./configure</I> script probes
your system to find out certain things about your C library functions
(if they are present, if they work, etc.). Although library functions
don't usually change, it is possible that two
different systems have slightly different shared C libraries. This
may become a problem for Squid if the two systems are different
enough.</P>

<P class="docText">Getting the Squid source code is really quite easy. To get it, visit
the Squid home page, <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</A>. The home page
has links to the current stable and development releases. If you
aren't located in the United States, you can select
one of the many mirror sites. The mirror sites are usually named
"www<span class="docEmphasis">N</span>.<span class="docEmphasis">CC</span>.squid-cache.org,"
where <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> is a number and <span class="docEmphasis">CC</span>
is a two-letter country code. For example,
<span class="docEmphasis">www1.au.squid-cache.org</span> is an Australian mirror
site. The home page has links to the current mirror sites.</P>

<P class="docText">Each Squid release branch (e.g., Squid-2.5) has its own HTML page.
This page has links to the source code releases and
"diffs" between releases. If you
are upgrading from one release to the next, you may want to download
the diff file and apply the patch as described in <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-3-SECT-7.html#squid-CHP-3-SECT-7">Section 3.7</A>. The release pages describe the new features
and important changes in each version, and also have links to bugs
that have been fixed.</P>

<P class="docText">When web access isn't an option, you can get the
source release from the ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org FTP
server or one of the FTP mirror sites. For the current versions, look
in the <I>pub/squid-2/DEVEL</I> or
<I>pub/squid-2/STABLE</I> directories. The Squid FTP
site is mirrored at many locations as well. You can use the same
country-code trick to guess some mirror sites, such as
<span class="docEmphasis">ftp1.uk.squid-cache.org</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">The current Squid release distributions are about 1 MB in size. After
downloading the compressed tar file, you can proceed to <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-3.html#squid-CHP-3">Chapter 3</A>.</P>
