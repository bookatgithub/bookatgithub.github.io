<P class="docText">If you've been using Unix for a while, chances are
that you've already compiled a number of other
software packages. If so, you can probably quickly scan this chapter.
The procedure for compiling and installing Squid is similar to many
other software distributions.</P>

<P class="docText">To compile Squid, you
<A NAME="squid-CHP-3-ITERM-1137"></A>need
an ANSI C compiler. Don't be too alarmed by the
"ANSI" part. Chances are that if
you already have a C compiler, it is compliant with the ANSI
specification. The GNU C compiler (<I>gcc</I>) is an
excellent choice and widely available. Most operating systems come
with a C compiler as a part of the standard installation. The common
exceptions are Solaris and HP-UX. If you're using
one of those operating systems, you might not have a compiler
installed.</P>

<P class="docText">Ideally you should compile Squid on the same system on which it will
run. Part of the installation process probes your system for certain
parameters, such as the number of available file descriptors.
However, if your system doesn't have a C compiler,
you may be able to compile Squid elsewhere and then copy the binaries
back. If the operating systems are different, Squid may encounter
some problems. Also, Squid may become confused if the two systems
have different kernel configurations.</P>

<P class="docText">In addition to a C compiler, you'll also need Perl
and <I>awk</I>. <I>awk</I> is a standard
program on all Unix systems, so you shouldn't need
to worry about it. Perl is quite common, but it may not be installed
on your system by default. You may need the <I>gzip</I>
program to uncompress the source distribution file.</P>

<P class="docText">Solaris users, make sure that <I>/usr/ccs/bin</I> is in
your PATH, even if you're using
<I>gcc</I>. To compile Squid, you may need the
<I>make</I> and <I>ar</I> programs found in
that directory.</P>
