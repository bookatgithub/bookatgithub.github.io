<H3 class="docSection1Title">3.7 Applying a Patch</H3>

<P class="docText">After you've been running Squid for
<A NAME="squid-CHP-3-ITERM-1177"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-3-ITERM-1178"></A>a while, you may find that you need to
patch the source code to fix a bug or add an experimental feature.
Patches are posted for important bug fixes on the
<span class="docEmphasis">squid-cache.org</span> web site. If you
don't want to wait for the next official release,
you can download and apply the patch to your source code. You will
then need to recompile Squid.</P>

<P class="docText">To apply a patch—also sometimes <A NAME="squid-CHP-3-ITERM-1179"></A>called a
<I>diff</I>—you need a program called
<I>patch</I>. Chances are that your operating system
already has the <I>patch</I> program. If not, you can
download it from the GNU collection (<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.gnu.org/directory/patch.html">http://www.gnu.org/directory/patch.html</A>).
Note that if you're using anonymous CVS (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-2-SECT-4.html#squid-CHP-2-SECT-4">Section 2.4</A>), you don't need to worry
about patching files. The CVS system does it for you automatically
when you update your tree.</P>

<P class="docText">To apply a patch, you need to save the patch file somewhere on your
system. Then <I>cd</I> to the Squid source directory and
run the command like this:</P>

<PRE>% cd squid-2.5.STABLE4
% patch &lt; /tmp/patch_file</PRE>

<P class="docText">By default, the <I>patch</I> program tells you what
it's doing as it runs. Usually this output scrolls
by very quickly, unless there is a problem. You can safely ignore the
warnings that say <TT>offset NNN lines</TT>. If you
don't want to see all this output, use the
<I>-s</I> option to make <I>patch</I> silent.</P>

<P class="docText">When <I>patch</I> updates the source files, it creates a
backup copy of the original file. For example, if
you're applying a patch to
<I>src/http.c</I>, <I>patch</I> names the
backup file <I>src/http.c.orig</I>. Thus, if you want
to undo the patch after applying it, you can simply rename all the
<I>.orig</I> files back to their former names. To use
this technique successfully, it's a good idea to
remove all <I>.orig</I> files before applying a patch.</P>

<P class="docText">If <I>patch</I> encounters a problem, it stops and
prompts you for advice. Common problems are as follows:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Running <I>patch</I> from the wrong directory. To fix
this problem, you may need to <I>cd</I> to a different
directory or use <I>patch</I>'s
<I>-p</I> option.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Patch is already applied. <I>patch</I> can usually tell
if the patch file has already been applied. In this case, it asks if
you want to unpatch the file.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">The<I> patch</I> program doesn't
understand the file you are giving it. Patch files come in three
flavors: normal, context, and unified. Old versions of
<I>patch</I> may not understand context or unified diff
output. Getting the latest version from the GNU FTP site will solve
this problem.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Corrupted patch file. If you aren't careful when
downloading and saving the patch file, it may become corrupted.
Sometimes people send patch files in email messages, and it is
tempting to simply cut-and-paste them into a new window. On some
systems, cut-and-paste can change Tab characters into spaces, or
incorrectly wrap long lines. Both changes confuse
<I>patch</I>. The <I>-l</I> option may be
helpful, but it's best to make sure you copy and
save the patch file correctly.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Sometimes <I>patch</I> can't apply part
or all of the diff. In these cases, you'll see such
messages as <TT>Hunk 3 of 4 failed</TT>. The failed
sections are saved to files named <I>.rej</I>. For
example, if a failure occurs while processing
<I>src/http.c</I>, <I>patch</I> saves that
piece of the diff to <I>src/http.c.rej</I>. In some
cases, you may be able to fix these by hand, but
it's usually not worth the trouble. If you have a
lot of "failed hunks" or
<I>.rej</I> files, it's a good idea to
download a whole new copy of the latest source code.</P>

<P class="docText">After you apply a patch, you need to recompile Squid. One of the
great things about <I>make</I> is that it only recompiles
the files that have changed. But sometimes <I>make</I>
doesn't comprehend all the intricate dependencies,
and it doesn't rebuild enough of the files. To be
safe, it's usually a good idea to recompile
everything. The best way to do this is to clean the source tree
before recompiling:</P>

<PRE>% make clean
% make</PRE>
