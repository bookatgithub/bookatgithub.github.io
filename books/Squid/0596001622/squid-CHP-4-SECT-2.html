<H3 class="docSection1Title">4.2 User IDs</H3>

<P class="docText">As you probably know, Unix
<A NAME="squid-CHP-4-ITERM-1187"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-4-ITERM-1188"></A>processes
and files have <span class="docEmphasis">user</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">group</span> ownership attributes. You need to select a
user and group for Squid. This user and group combination must have
read and write access to most of the Squid-related files and
directories.</P>

<P class="docText">I highly recommend creating a dedicated <span class="docEmphasis">squid</span>
user and group. This minimizes the chance that someone can exploit
Squid to read other files on the system. If more than one person has
administrative authority over Squid, you can add them to the
<span class="docEmphasis">squid</span> group.</P>

<P class="docText">Unix processes inherit their parent process'
ownership attributes. That is, if you start Squid as user
<span class="docEmphasis">joe</span>, Squid also runs as user
<span class="docEmphasis">joe</span>. If you don't want Squid to
run as <span class="docEmphasis">joe</span>, you need to change your user ID
beforehand. This is typically accomplished with the
<I>su</I> command. For example:</P>

<PRE>joe% su - squid
squid% /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid</PRE>

<P class="docText">Unfortunately, running Squid isn't always so simple.
In some cases, you may need to start Squid as
<span class="docEmphasis">root</span>, depending on your
<A NAME="squid-CHP-4-ITERM-1189"></A>configuration. For example, only
<span class="docEmphasis">root</span> can bind a TCP socket to privileged ports
like port 80. If you need to start Squid as
<span class="docEmphasis">root</span>, you must set the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_effective_user</span> directive. It tells Squid
which user to become after performing the tasks that require special
privileges. For example:</P>

<PRE>cache_effective_user squid</PRE>

<P class="docText">The name that you provide must be a valid user (i.e., in the
<I>/etc/passwd</I> file). Furthermore, note that this
directive is used only when you start Squid as
<span class="docEmphasis">root</span>. Only <span class="docEmphasis">root</span> has the
ability to become another user. If you start Squid as
<span class="docEmphasis">joe</span>, it can't switch to user
<span class="docEmphasis">squid</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">You might be tempted to just run Squid as <span class="docEmphasis">root</span>
without setting <span class="docEmphasis">cache_effective_user</span>. If you
try, you'll find that Squid refuses to run. This,
again, is due to security concerns. If an outsider were somehow able
to compromise or exploit Squid, he could gain full access to your
system. Although we strive to make Squid secure and bug-free, this
requirement provides some extra insurance, just in case.</P>

<P class="docText">If you start Squid as <span class="docEmphasis">root</span> without setting
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_effective_user</span>, Squid uses
<TT>nobody</TT> as the default value. Whatever user ID you
choose for Squid, make sure it has read access to the files installed
in <I>$prefix/etc</I>,
<I>$prefix/libexec</I>, and
<I>$prefix/share</I>. The user ID must also have write
access to the log files and cache directory.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid also has a <span class="docEmphasis">cache_effective_group</span>
directive, but you probably don't need to set it. By
default, Squid uses the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_effective_user</span>'s default
group (from the password file).</P>
