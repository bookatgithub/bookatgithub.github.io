<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1444"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1445"></A>the most important in
<I>squid.conf</I>. It tells Squid where and how to

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.1.1 Scheme</H4>

<P class="docText">Squid supports a number of different <A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1446"></A>storage schemes.
The default (and original) is <span class="docEmphasis">ufs</span>. Depending on
your operating system, you may be able to select other schemes. You
must use the
<I>—enable-storeio</I><span class="docEmphasis">=</span><TT><I>LIST</I></TT>

about the <span class="docEmphasis">ufs</span> scheme, which is compatible with
<span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">diskd</span>.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.1.2 Directory</H4>

<P class="docText">The <I>directory</I> argument is a filesystem
<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1447"></A>directory, under which Squid stores
cached objects. Normally, a <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span>
corresponds to a whole filesystem or disk partition. It usually
doesn't make sense to put more than one cache
directory on a single filesystem partition. Furthermore, I also
recommend putting only one cache directory on each physical disk
drive. For example, if you have two unused hard drives, you might do
something like this:</P>

<PRE># newfs /dev/da1d
# newfs /dev/da2d
# mount /dev/da1d /cache0
# mount /dev/da2d /cache1</PRE>

<P class="docText">And then add these lines to <I>squid.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE>cache_dir ufs /cache0 7000 16 256
cache_dir ufs /cache1 7000 16 256</PRE>

<P class="docText">If you don't have any spare hard drives, you can, of
course, use an existing filesystem partition. Select one with plenty
of free space, perhaps <I>/usr</I> or
<I>/var</I>, and create a new directory there. For
example:</P>

<PRE># mkdir /var/squidcache</PRE>

<P class="docText">Then add a line like this to <I>squid.conf</I>:</P>

<PRE>cache_dir ufs /var/squidcache 7000 16 256</PRE>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.1.3 Size</H4>

<P class="docText">The third <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> argument
<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1448"></A>specifies the size of the cache
directory. This is an upper limit on the amount of disk space that
Squid can use for the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span>. Calculating an
appropriate value can be tricky. You lose some space to filesystem
overheads, and you must leave enough free space for temporary files
and <I>swap.state</I> logs (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-13-SECT-6.html#squid-CHP-13-SECT-6">Section 13.6</A>). I recommend mounting the empty filesystem
and running <I>df</I>:</P>

<PRE>% df -k
Filesystem  1K-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/da1d     3037766        8  2794737     0%    /cache0
/dev/da2d     3037766        8  2794737     0%    /cache1</PRE>

<P class="docText">Here you can see that the filesystem has about 2790 MB of available
space. Remember that UFS reserves some
"minfree" space, 8% in this case,
which is why Squid can't use the full 3040 MB in the
filesystem.</P>

<P class="docText">You might be tempted just to put <TT>2790</TT> on the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> line. You might even to get away with
it if your cache isn't very busy and if you rotate
the log files often. To be safe, however, I recommend taking off
another 10% or so. This extra space will be used by
Squid's <I>swap.state</I> file and
temporary files.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_swap_low</span> directive also
affects how much space Squid uses. I'll talk about
the low and high watermarks in <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-2.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-2">Section 7.2</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">The bottom line is that you should initially be conservative about
the size of your <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span>. Start off with a low
estimate and allow the cache to fill up. After Squid runs for a week
or so with full cache directories, you'll be in a
good position to re-evaluate the size settings. If you have plenty of
free space, feel free to increase the cache directory size in
increments of a few percent.</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.3.1"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.1.3.1 Inodes</H5>

<P class="docText"><I>Inodes</I> are fundamental
<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1449"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1450"></A>building
blocks of Unix filesystems. They contain information about disk
files, such as permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps. If your
filesystem runs out of inodes, you can't create new
files, even if it has space available. Running out of inodes is bad,
so you may want to make sure you have enough before running Squid.</P>

<P class="docText">The programs that create new filesystems (e.g.,
<I>newfs</I> or <span class="docEmphasis">mkfs</span>) reserve some
number of inodes based on the total size. These programs usually
allow you to set the ratio of inodes to disk space. For example, see
the <I>-i</I> option in the <I>newfs</I> and
<I>mkfs</I> manpages. The ratio of disk space to inodes
determines the mean file size the filesystem can support. Most Unix
systems create one inode for each 4 KB, which is usually sufficient
for Squid. Research shows that, for most caching proxies, the mean
file size is about 10 KB. You may be able to get away with 8 KB per
inode, but it is risky.</P>

<P class="docText">You can monitor your system's inode usage with
<I>df -i</I>. For example:</P>

<PRE>% df -ik

<P class="docText">As long as the inode usage (<TT>%iused</TT>) is less than
the space usage (<TT>Capacity</TT>),
you're in good shape. Unfortunately, you
can't add more inodes to an existing filesystem. If
you find that you are running out of inodes, you need to stop Squid
and recreate your filesystems. If you're not willing
to do that, decrease the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> size instead.</P>



<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.3.2"></A>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">7.1.3.2 The relationship between disk space and process size</H5>

<P class="docText">Squid's disk space usage
<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1451"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1452"></A>directly affects its
memory usage as well. Every object that exists on disk requires a
small amount of memory. Squid uses the memory as an index to the
on-disk data. If you add a new cache directory or otherwise increase
the disk cache size, make sure that you also have enough free memory.
Squid's performance degrades very quickly if its
process size reaches or exceeds your system's
physical memory capacity.</P>

<P class="docText">Every object in Squid's cache directories takes
either 76 or 112 bytes of memory, depending on your system. The
memory is allocated as <span class="docEmphasis">StoreEntry</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">MD5
Digest</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">LRU</span> <span class="docEmphasis">policy
node</span> structures. Small-pointer (i.e., 32-bit) systems,
like those based on the Intel Pentium, take 76 bytes. On systems with
CPUs that support 64-bit pointers, each object takes 112 bytes. You
can find out how much memory these structures use on your system by
viewing the Memory Utilization page of the cache manager (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-14-SECT-2.html#squid-CHP-14-SECT-2.1.2">Section 14.2.1.2</A>).</P>

<P class="docText">Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict precisely how much
additional memory is required for a given amount of disk space. It
depends on the mean reply size, which typically fluctuates over time.
Additionally, Squid uses memory for many other data structures and
purposes. Don't assume that your estimates are, or
will remain, correct. You should constantly monitor
Squid's process size and consider shrinking the
cache size if necessary.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.1.4 L1 and L2</H4>

<P class="docText">For the <span class="docEmphasis">ufs</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span>, and
<span class="docEmphasis">diskd</span> schemes, Squid <A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1453"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1454"></A>creates a two-level
directory tree underneath the cache directory. The L1 and L2
arguments specify the number of first- and second-level directories.
The defaults are 16 and 256, respectively. <A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-7-FIG-1">Figure 7-1</A> shows the filesystem structure.</P>

<P class="docText">Some people think that Squid performs better, or worse, depending on
the particular values for L1 and L2. It seems to make sense,
intuitively, that small directories can be searched faster than large
ones. Thus, L1 and L2 should probably be large enough so that each L2
directory has no more than a few hundred files.</P>

<P class="docText">For example, let's say you have a cache directory
that stores about 7000 MB. Given a mean file size of 10 KB, you can
store about 700,000 files in this <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span>.
With 16 L1 and 256 L2 directories, there are 4096 total second-level
directories. 700,000 &#247; 4096 leaves about 170 files in each
second-level directory.</P>

<P class="docText">The process of creating swap directories with <I>squid
-z</I>, goes faster for smaller values of L1 and L2. Thus, if
your cache size is really small, you may want to reduce the number of
L1 and L2 directories.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid assigns each cache object a unique <I>file
number</I>. This is a 32-bit integer that uniquely identifies
files on disk. Squid uses a relatively simple algorithm for turning
file numbers into pathnames. The algorithm uses L1 and L2 as
parameters. Thus, if you change L1 and L2, you change the mapping
from file number to pathname. Changing these parameters for a
nonempty <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> makes the existing files
inaccessible. You should never change L1 and L2 after the cache
directory has become active.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid allocates file numbers within a cache directory sequentially.
The file number-to-pathname algorithm (e.g.,
<I>storeUfsDirFullPath( )</I>) is written so that each
group of L2 files go into the same second-level directory. Squid does
this to take advantage of locality of reference. This algorithm
increases the probability that an HTML file and its embedded images
are stored in the same second-level directory. Some people expect
Squid to spread cache files evenly among the second-level
directories. However, when the cache is initially filling,
you'll find that only the first few directories
contain any files. For example:</P>

<PRE>% cd /cache0; du -k
2164    ./00/00
2146    ./00/01
2689    ./00/02
1974    ./00/03
2201    ./00/04
2463    ./00/05
2724    ./00/06
3174    ./00/07
1144    ./00/08
1       ./00/09
1       ./00/0A
1       ./00/0B
