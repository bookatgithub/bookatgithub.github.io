<P class="docText">At some point you may find <A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1476"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1477"></A>it
<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1478"></A>necessary
to manually remove one or more objects from Squid's
cache. This might happen if:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">One of your users complains about always receiving stale data.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Your cache becomes "poisoned" with
a forged response.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Squid's cache index becomes corrupted after
experiencing disk I/O errors or frequent crashes and restarts.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">You want to remove some large objects to free up room for new data.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Squid was caching responses from local servers, and now you
don't want it to.</P></LI></UL>
<P class="docText">Some of these problems can be solved by forcing a reload in a web
browser. However, this doesn't always work. For
example, some browsers display certain content types externally by
launching another program; that program probably
doesn't have a reload button or even know about
caches.</P>

<P class="docText">You can always use the <I>squidclient</I> program to
reload a cached object if necessary. Simply insert the
<I>-r</I> option before the URI:</P>

<PRE>% squidclient -r http://www.lrrr.org/junk &gt;/tmp/foo</PRE>

<P class="docText">If you happen to have a <span class="docEmphasis">refresh_pattern</span>
directive with the <TT>ignore-reload</TT> option set, you
and your users may be unable to force a validation of the cached
response. In that case, you'll be better off purging
the offending object or objects.</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-SECT-6.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.1 Removing Individual Objects</H4>

<P class="docText">Squid accepts a custom request method for removing cached objects.
The <TT>PURGE</TT> method isn't one of the
official HTTP request methods. It is different from
<TT>DELETE</TT>, which Squid forwards to an origin server.
A <TT>PURGE</TT> request asks Squid to remove the object
given in the URI. Squid returns either 200 (Ok) or 404 (Not Found).</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>PURGE</TT> method is somewhat dangerous because it
removes cached objects. Squid disables the <TT>PURGE</TT>
method unless you define an ACL for it. Normally you should allow
<TT>PURGE</TT> requests only from localhost and perhaps a
small number of trusted hosts. The configuration may look like this:</P>

<PRE>acl AdminBoxes src 127.0.0.1 172.16.0.1 192.168.0.1
acl Purge method PURGE
http_access allow AdminBoxes Purge
http_access deny Purge</PRE>

<P class="docText">The <I>squidclient</I> program provides an easy way to
generate <TT>PURGE</TT> requests. For example:</P>

<PRE>% squidclient -m PURGE http://www.lrrr.org/junk</PRE>

<P class="docText">Alternatively, you could use something else (such as a Perl script)
to generate your own HTTP request. It can be very simple:</P>

<PRE>PURGE http://www.lrrr.org/junk HTTP/1.0
Accept: */*</PRE>

<P class="docText">Note that a URI alone doesn't uniquely identify a
cached response. Squid also uses the original request method in the
cache key. It may also use other request headers if the response
contains a <TT>Vary</TT> header. When you issue a
<TT>PURGE</TT> request, Squid looks for cached objects
originally requested with the <TT>GET</TT> and
<TT>HEAD</TT> methods. Furthermore, Squid also removes all
variants of a response, unless you remove a specific variant by
including the appropriate headers in the <TT>PURGE</TT>
request. Squid removes only variants for <TT>GET</TT> and
<TT>HEAD</TT> requests.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-SECT-6.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.2 Removing a Group of Objects</H4>

<P class="docText">Unfortunately, Squid doesn't
<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1479"></A>provide a good mechanism for removing a
bunch of objects at once. This often comes up when someone wants to
remove all objects belonging to a certain origin server.</P>

<P class="docText">Squid lacks this feature for a couple of reasons. First, Squid would
have to perform a linear search through all cached objects. This is
CPU-intensive and takes a long time. While Squid is searching, your
users can experience a performance degradation. Second, Squid keeps
MD5s, rather than URIs, in memory. MD5s are one-way hashes, which
means, for example, that you can't tell if a given
MD5 hash was generated from a URI that contains the string
"www.example.com." The only way to
know is to recalculate the MD5 from the original URI and see if they
match. Because Squid doesn't have the URI, it
can't perform the calculation.</P>

<P class="docText">So what can you do?</P>

<P class="docText">You can use the data <A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1480"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1481"></A>in
<I>access.log</I> to get a list of URIs that might be
in the cache. Then, feed them to <I>squidclient</I> or
another utility to generate <TT>PURGE</TT> requests. For
example:</P>

<PRE>% awk '{print $7}' /usr/local/squid/var/logs/access.log \
        | grep www.example.com \
        | xargs -n 1 squidclient -m PURGE</PRE>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-7-SECT-6.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">7.6.3 Removing All Objects</H4>

<P class="docText">In <A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1482"></A>extreme circumstances you
may need to wipe out the entire cache, or at least one of the cache
directories. First, you must make sure that Squid
isn't running.</P>

<P class="docText">One of the easiest ways to make Squid forget about all cached objects
is to overwrite the <I>swap.state</I> files. Note that
you can't simply remove the
<I>swap.state</I> files because Squid then scans the
cache directories and opens all the object files. You also
can't simply truncate
<I>swap.state</I> to a zero-sized file. Instead, you
should put a single byte there, like this:</P>

<PRE># echo '' &gt; /usr/local/squid/var/cache/swap.state</PRE>

<P class="docText">When Squid reads the <I>swap.state</I> file, it gets an
error because the record that should be there is too short. The next
read results in an end-of-file condition, and Squid completes the
rebuild procedure without loading any object metadata.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that this technique doesn't remove the cache
files from your disk. You've only tricked Squid into
thinking that the cache is empty. As Squid runs, it adds new files to
the cache and may overwrite the old files. In some cases, this might
cause your disk to run out of free space. If that happens to you, you
need to remove the old files before restarting Squid again.</P>

<P class="docText">One way to remove cache files is with <I>rm</I>. However,
it often takes a very long time to remove all the files that Squid
has created. To get Squid running faster, you can rename the cache
directory, create a new one, start Squid, and remove the old one at
the same time. For example:</P>

<PRE># squid -k shutdown
# cd /usr/local/squid/var
# mv cache oldcache
# mkdir cache
# chown nobody:nobody cache
# squid -z
# squid -s
# rm -rf oldcache &amp;</PRE>

<P class="docText">Another technique is to simply run <I>newfs</I> (or
<TT>mkfs</TT>) on the cache filesystem. This works only if
you have the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> on its own <A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1483"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-7-ITERM-1484"></A>disk partition.</P>
