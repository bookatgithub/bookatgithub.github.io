<P class="docText">Web caches such as Squid don't usually
<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1487"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1488"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1489"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1490"></A>come right out and tell you when
disk I/O is becoming a bottleneck. Instead, response time and/or hit
ratio degrade as load increases. The tricky thing is that response
time and hit ratio may be changing for other reasons, such as
increased network latency and changes in client request patterns.</P>

<P class="docText">Perhaps the best way to explore the performance limits of your cache
is with a benchmark, such as Web Polygraph. The good thing about a
benchmark is that you can fully control the environment and eliminate
many unknowns. You can also repeat the same experiment with different
cache configurations. Unfortunately, benchmarking often takes a lot
of time and requires spare systems that aren't
already being used.</P>

<P class="docText">If you have the resources
<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1491"></A>to benchmark Squid, begin with a standard
caching workload. As you increase the load, at some point you should
see a significant increase in response time and/or a decrease in hit
ratio. Once you observe this performance degradation, run the
experiment again but with disk caching disabled. You can configure
Squid never to cache any response (with the <span class="docEmphasis">null</span>
storage scheme, see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-8-SECT-7.html#squid-CHP-8-SECT-7">Section 8.7</A>). Alternatively, you can
configure the workload to have 100% uncachable responses. If the
average response time is significantly better without caching, you
can be relatively certain that disk I/O is a bottleneck at that level
of throughput.</P>

<P class="docText">If you're like most people, you have neither the
time nor resources to benchmark Squid. In this case, you can examine
Squid's runtime statistics to look for disk I/O
bottlenecks. The cache manager General Runtime Information page (see
<A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-14.html#squid-CHP-14">Chapter 14</A>) gives you median response times for
both cache hits and misses:</P>

<PRE>Median Service Times (seconds)  5 min    60 min:
        HTTP Requests (All):   0.39928  0.35832
        Cache Misses:          0.42149  0.39928
        Cache Hits:            0.12783  0.11465
        Near Hits:             0.37825  0.39928
        Not-Modified Replies:  0.07825  0.07409</PRE>

<P class="docText">For a healthy Squid cache, hits are significantly faster than misses.
Your median hit response time should usually be 0.5 seconds or less.
I strongly recommend that you use SNMP or another network monitoring
tool to collect periodic measurements from your Squid caches (see
<A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-14.html#squid-CHP-14">Chapter 14</A>). A significant (factor of two) increase
in median hit response time is a good indication that you have a disk
I/O bottleneck.</P>

<P class="docText">If you believe your production cache is suffering in this manner, you
can test your theory with the same technique mentioned previously.
Configure Squid not to cache any responses, thus avoiding all disk
I/O. Then closely observe the <span class="docEmphasis">cache miss</span>
response time. If it goes down, your theory is probably correct.</P>

<P class="docText">Once you've convinced yourself that disk throughput
is limiting Squid's performance, you can try a
number of things to improve it. Some of these require recompiling
Squid, while others are relatively simple steps you can take to tune
the Unix filesystems.</P>
