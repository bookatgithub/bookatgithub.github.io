<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> storage scheme <A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1500"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1501"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1502"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1503"></A>has evolved out of the very
first attempt to improve Squid's disk I/O response
time. The "a" stands for
asynchronous I/O. The only difference between the default
<span class="docEmphasis">ufs</span> scheme and <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> is that
I/Os aren't executed by the main Squid process. The
data layout and format is the same, so you can easily switch between
the two schemes without losing any cache data.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> uses a number of thread processes for disk
I/O operations. Each time Squid needs to read, write, open, close, or
remove a cache file, the I/O request is dispatched to one of the
thread processes. When the thread completes the I/O, it signals the
main Squid process and returns a status code. Actually, in Squid 2.5,
certain file operations aren't executed
asynchronously by default. Most notably, disk writes are always
performed synchronously. You can change this by setting
<TT>ASYNC_WRITE</TT> to <TT>1</TT> in
<I>src/fs/aufs/store_asyncufs.h</I> and recompiling.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> code requires
<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1504"></A>a <I>pthreads</I>
library. This is the standard threads interface, defined by POSIX.
Even though <span class="docEmphasis">pthreads</span> is available on many Unix
systems, I often encounter compatibility problems and differences.
The <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> storage system seems to run well only
on Linux and Solaris. Even though the code compiles, you may
encounter serious problem on other operating systems.</P>

<P class="docText">To use <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span>, you must add a special
<I>./configure</I> option:</P>

<PRE>% ./configure --enable-storeio=aufs,ufs</PRE>

<P class="docText">Strictly speaking, you don't really need to specify
<span class="docEmphasis">ufs</span> in the list of <TT>storeio</TT>
modules. However, you might as well because if you try
<span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> and don't like it,
you'll be able to fall back to the plain
<span class="docEmphasis">ufs</span> storage scheme.</P>

<P class="docText">You can also use the
<I>—with-aio-threads=</I><TT><I>N</I></TT>
option if you like. If you omit it, Squid automatically calculates
the number of threads to use based on the number of
<span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span>s. <A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-8-TABLE-1">Table 8-1</A> shows the default number of threads for up to

<P class="docText">After you compile <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> support into Squid, you

<P class="docText">After starting Squid with <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> enabled, make
sure everything still works correctly. You may want to run
<I>tail -f store.log</I> for a while to make sure that
objects are being swapped out to disk. You should also run
<I>tail -f cache.log</I> and look for any new errors or
warnings.</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-SECT-4.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.4.1 How aufs Works</H4>

<P class="docText">Squid creates a number of thread processes by calling
<I>pthread_create( )</I>. All threads are created upon
the first disk activity. Thus, you'll see all the
thread processes even if Squid is idle.</P>

<P class="docText">Whenever Squid wants to perform some disk I/O operation (e.g., to
open a file for reading), it allocates a couple of data structures
and places the I/O request into a queue. The thread processes have a
loop that take I/O requests from the queue and executes them. Because
the request queue is shared by all threads, Squid uses mutex locks to
ensure that only one thread updates the queue at a given time.</P>

<P class="docText">The I/O operations block the thread process until they are complete.
Then, the status of the operation is placed on a <I>done
queue</I>. The main Squid process periodically checks the
done queue for completed operations. The module that requested the
disk I/O is notified that the operation is complete, and the request
or response processing proceeds.</P>

<P class="docText">As you may have guessed, <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span> can take advantage
of systems with multiple CPUs. The only locking that occurs is on the
request and result queues. Otherwise, all other functions execute
independently. While the main process executes on one CPU, another
CPU handles the actual I/O system calls.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-SECT-4.2"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.4.2 aufs Issues</H4>

<P class="docText">An interesting property of <A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1505"></A>threads
is that all processes share the same resources, including memory and
file descriptors. For example, when a thread process opens a file as
descriptor 27, all other threads can then access that file with the
same descriptor number. As you probably know, file-descriptor
shortage is a common problem with first-time Squid administrators.
Unix kernels typically have two file-descriptor limits: per process
and systemwide. While you might think that 256 file descriptors per
process is plenty (because of all the thread processes), it
doesn't work that way. In this case, all threads
share that small number of descriptors. Be sure to increase your
system's per-process file descriptor limit to 4096
or higher, especially when using <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">Tuning the number of threads can be tricky. In some cases, you might
see this warning in <I>cache.log</I>:</P>

<PRE>2003/09/29 13:42:47| squidaio_queue_request: WARNING - Disk I/O overloading</PRE>

<P class="docText">It means that Squid has a large number of I/O operations queued up,
waiting for an available thread. Your first instinct may be to
increase the number of threads. I would suggest, however, that you
decrease the number instead.</P>

<P class="docText">Increasing the number of threads also increases the queue size. Past
a certain point, it doesn't increase
<span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span>'s load capacity. It only
means that more operations become queued. Longer queues result in
higher response times, which is probably something
you'd like to avoid.</P>

<P class="docText">Decreasing the number of threads, and the queue size, means that
Squid can detect the overload condition faster. When a
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> is overloaded, it is removed from the
selection algorithm (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-4.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-4">Section 7.4</A>). Then, Squid
either chooses a different <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> or simply
doesn't store the response on disk. This may be a
better situation for your users. Even though the hit ratio goes down,
response time remains relatively low.</P>


<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-SECT-4.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.4.3 Monitoring aufs Operation</H4>

<P class="docText">The Async IO Counters option <A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1506"></A>in the
cache manager menu displays a few statistics relating to
<I>aufs</I>. It shows counters for the number of open,
close, read, write, stat, and unlink requests received. For example:</P>

<PRE>% squidclient mgr:squidaio_counts
...
ASYNC IO Counters:
Operation       # Requests
open             15318822
close            15318813
cancel           15318813
write                   0
read             19237139
stat                    0
unlink            2484325
check_callback  311678364
queue                   0</PRE>

<P class="docText">The cancel counter is normally equal to the close counter. This is
because the close function always calls the cancel function to ensure
that any pending I/O operations are ignored.</P>

<P class="docText">The write counter is zero because this version of Squid performs
writes synchronously, even for <span class="docEmphasis">aufs</span>.</P>

<P class="docText">The check_callback counter shows how many times the main Squid
process has checked the done queue for completed operations.</P>

<P class="docText">The queue value indicates the current length of the request queue.
Normally, the queue length should be less than the number of threads
x 5. If you repeatedly observe a queue length larger than
this, you may be pushing Squid too hard. Adding more threads may help
but only <A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1507"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1508"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1509"></A>to a certain point.</P>
