<P class="docText">The Cyclic Object Storage Scheme (<span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>)
<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1518"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1519"></A>is an attempt to develop
a custom filesystem for Squid. With the
<span class="docEmphasis">ufs</span>-based schemes, the primary performance
bottleneck comes from the need to execute so many
<TT>open( )</TT> and <TT>unlink( )</TT> system
calls. Because each cached response is stored in a separate disk
file, Squid is always opening, closing, and removing files.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>, on the other hand, uses one big file to
store all responses. In this sense, it is a small, custom filesystem
specifically for Squid. <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> implements many of
the functions normally handled by the underlying filesystem, such as
allocating space for new data and remembering where there is free
space.</P>

<P class="docText">Unfortunately, <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> is still a little rough
around the edges. Development of <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> has been
proceeding slowly over the last couple of years. Nonetheless,
I'll describe it here in case you feel adventurous.</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-SECT-6.1"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.6.1 How coss Works</H4>

<P class="docText">On the disk, each <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> is just one big file. The file grows
in size until it reaches its maximum size. At this point, Squid
starts over at the beginning of the file, overwriting any data
already stored there. Thus, new objects are always stored at the
"end" of this cyclic
file.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-8-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-FNOTE-3">[3]</A></sup> The beginning is the location where data was
first written; the end is the location where data was most recently
written.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">Squid actually doesn't write new object data to disk
immediately. Instead, the data is copied into a 1-MB memory buffer,
called a <I>stripe</I>. A stripe is written to disk
when it becomes full. <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> uses asynchronous
writes so that the main Squid process doesn't become
blocked on disk I/O.</P>

<P class="docText">As with other filesystems, <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> also uses the
<I>blocksize</I> concept. Back in <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-1.4">Section 7.1.4</A>, I talked about file numbers. Each cached
object has a file number that Squid uses to locate the data on disk.
For <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>, the file number is the same as the
block number. For example, a cached object with a swap file number
equal to 112 starts at the 112th block in a <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>
filesystem. File numbers aren't allocated
sequentially with <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>. Some file numbers are
unavailable because cached objects generally occupy more than one
block in the <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> file.</P>

<P class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> block size is configurable with a
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> option. Because
Squid's file numbers are only 24 bits, the block
size determines the maximum size of a <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> cache
directory: size = block_size x
2<SUP>24</SUP>. For example, with a 512-byte block
size, you can store up to 8 GB in a <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span>.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> doesn't implement any of
Squid's normal cache replacement algorithms (see
<A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7-SECT-5.html#squid-CHP-7-SECT-5">Section 7.5</A>). Instead, cache hits are
"moved" to the end of the cyclic
file. This is, essentially, the LRU algorithm. It does,
unfortunately, mean that cache hits cause disk writes, albeit
indirectly.</P>

<P class="docText">With <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>, there is no need to unlink or remove
cached objects. Squid simply forgets about the space allocated to
objects that are removed. The space will be reused eventually when
the end of the cyclic file reaches that place again.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.6.2 Compiling and Configuring coss</H4>

<P class="docText">To use <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>, you must add it to the
<I>—enable-storeio</I> list
<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1520"></A>
<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1521"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1522"></A>when running
<I>./configure</I>:</P>

<PRE>% ./configure --enable-storeio=ufs,coss ...</PRE>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> cache directories require a
<TT>max-size</TT> option. Its value must be less than the
stripe size (1 MB by default, but configurable with the
<I>—enable-coss-membuf-size</I> option). Also note
that you must omit the L1 and L2 values that are normally present for
<span class="docEmphasis">ufs</span>-based schemes. Here is an example:</P>

<PRE>cache_dir coss /cache0/coss 7000 max-size=1000000
cache_dir coss /cache1/coss 7000 max-size=1000000
cache_dir coss /cache2/coss 7000 max-size=1000000
cache_dir coss /cache3/coss 7000 max-size=1000000
cache_dir coss /cache4/coss 7000 max-size=1000000</PRE>

<P class="docText">Furthermore, you can change the default <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>
block size with the <TT>block-size</TT> option:</P>

<PRE>cache_dir coss /cache0/coss 30000 max-size=1000000 block-size=2048</PRE>

<P class="docText">One tricky thing about <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> is that the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> directory argument (e.g.,
<I>/cache0/coss</I>) isn't actually a
directory. Instead, it is a regular file that Squid opens, and
creates if necessary. This is so you can use raw partitions as
<span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> files. If you mistakenly create the
<span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> file as a directory,
you'll see an error like this when starting Squid:</P>

<PRE>2003/09/29 18:51:42|  /usr/local/squid/var/cache: (21) Is a directory
FATAL: storeCossDirInit: Failed to open a coss file.</PRE>

<P class="docText">Because the <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> argument
isn't a directory, you must use the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_swap_log</span> directive (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-13-SECT-6.html#squid-CHP-13-SECT-6">Section 13.6</A>). Otherwise Squid attempts to create a
<I>swap.state</I> file in the
<span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span> directory. In that case,
you'll see an error like this:</P>

<PRE>2003/09/29 18:53:38| /usr/local/squid/var/cache/coss/swap.state:
        (2) No such file or directory
FATAL: storeCossDirOpenSwapLog: Failed to open swap log.</PRE>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> uses asynchronous I/Os for better
performance. In particular, it uses the <I>aio_read(
)</I> and <I>aio_write( )</I> system calls.
These may not be available on all operating systems. At this time,
they are available on FreeBSD, Solaris, and Linux. If the
<span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> code seems to compile okay, but you get a
"Function not implemented" error
message, you need to enable these system calls in your kernel. On
FreeBSD, your kernel must have this option:</P>

<A NAME="squid-CHP-8-SECT-6.3"></A>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">8.6.3 coss Issues</H4>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> is still an experimental feature. The code
has not yet proven stable enough for everyday use. If you want to
play with and help improve it, be prepared to lose any data stored in
a <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> <span class="docEmphasis">cache_dir</span>. On the
plus side, <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>'s preliminary
performance tests are very good. For an example, see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-D.html#squid-APP-D">Appendix D</A>.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> doesn't support rebuilding
cached data from disk very well. When you restart Squid, you might
find that it fails to read the <span class="docEmphasis">coss</span>
<I>swap.state</I> files, thus losing any cached data.
Furthermore, Squid doesn't remember its place in the
cyclic file after a restart. It always starts back at the beginning.</P>

<P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> takes a nonstandard approach to object
replacement. This may cause a lower hit ratio than you might get with
one of the other storage schemes.</P>

<P class="docText">Some operating systems have problems with files larger than 2 GB. If
this happens to you, you can always create more, smaller
<span class="docEmphasis">coss</span> areas. For example:</P>

<PRE>cache_dir coss /cache0/coss0 1900 max-size=1000000 block-size=128
cache_dir coss /cache0/coss1 1900 max-size=1000000 block-size=128
cache_dir coss /cache0/coss2 1900 max-size=1000000 block-size=128
cache_dir coss /cache0/coss3 1900 max-size=1000000 block-size=128</PRE>

<P class="docText">Using a raw disk device (e.g., <I>/dev/da0s1c</I>)
doesn't work very well yet. One reason is that disk
devices usually require that I/Os take place on 512-byte block
boundaries. Another concern is that direct disk access bypasses the
systems buffer cache and may degrade performance. Many disk drives,
however, <A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1523"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-8-ITERM-1524"></A>have built-in caches these days.</P>
