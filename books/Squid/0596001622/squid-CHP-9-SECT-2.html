<H3 class="docSection1Title">9.2 Why (Not) Intercept?</H3>

<P class="docText">Many organizations find <A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1536"></A>interception caching attractive
because they can't, or would rather not, configure
all their user's web browsers. It's
probably easier to perform a little network trickery on a single
switch or router than it is to configure hundreds or thousands of
workstations. As with many choices we face, interception caching is
really a tradeoff. It brings both benefits and drawbacks. It may make
your life easier, or more difficult.</P>

<P class="docText">The obvious benefit of interception caching is that all HTTP requests
leaving your network automatically go through Squid. You
don't need to worry about configuring any browsers
or that users might disable their proxy settings. Interception
caching puts you, the network administrator, in control of the HTTP
traffic. You can change, add, or remove Squid caches from service
without significantly interrupting your users' web
surfing.</P>

<P class="docText">Most of the disadvantages surrounding HTTP interception are because
this technique violates the TCP/IP standards. These protocols mandate
that routers (and switches) forward TCP/IP packets to the host
specified by the destination IP address. Diverting the packets to a
caching proxy breaks the rules. The proxy accepts diverted
connections under false pretense. User agents are tricked into
believing they have established a TCP connection with the origin
server.</P>

<P class="docText">This confusion causes a serious problem with older versions of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The
browser's Reload button is the easiest way to
refresh an HTML page. When Explorer is configured to use a caching
proxy, a reload request includes a <TT>Cache-Control</TT>:
<TT>no-cache</TT> header to force a cache miss (or
validation) and ensure that the response is up to date. Explorer
omits this header when not explicitly configured for proxying. With
interception caching, Explorer thinks it is connecting to the origin
server anyway, and there is no need to send this header. Squid
can't tell that the user pressed the Reload button
in this case and may not validate the cached response.
Squid's <span class="docEmphasis">ie_refresh</span> provides a
partial workaround for this bug (see <A class="docLink" HREF="appa-77635.html#appa-77635">Appendix A</A>).
According to Microsoft, this problem has been corrected in Explorer
Version 5.5, Service Pack 1.<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-9-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-FNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup> See Microsoft support
knowledge base article Q266121 for more (or less)
information:
<A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q266/1/21.ASP">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q266/1/21.ASP</A>.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">For similar reasons, you can't
<A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1537"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1538"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1539"></A>use HTTP proxy authentication in
combination with interception caching. Because the client is unaware
of the proxy, it doesn't send the necessary
<TT>Proxy-Authorization</TT> header. Additionally, the 407
(Proxy Authorization Required) response code is inappropriate because
the response should look like it came from the origin server, which
would never send such a reply.</P>

<P class="docText">You also can't use RFC 1413 ident lookups (see <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-6-SECT-1.html#squid-CHP-6-SECT-1.2.11">Section 6.1.2.11</A>) with interception. Squid
can't bind a new TCP socket to the necessary IP
address. The operating system cheats when forwarding the intercepted
connection to Squid. However, it can't cheat when
Squid wants to bind a new TCP socket to the foreign IP address. The
address that it wants to bind to isn't really local,
so the <I>bind</I> system call fails.</P>

<P class="docText">Interception caching is also incompatible with IP filtering designed
to prevent address spoofing (See also RFC 2267: Network Ingress
Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks Which Employ IP Source
Address Spoofing). Consider the network shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-9-FIG-2">Figure 9-2</A>. The router has two LAN interfaces: lan0 and
lan1. The network administrator uses packet filters on the router to
make sure that the internal hosts don't transmit
packets with spoofed source addresses. The router forwards only
packets with source addresses corresponding to the connected
networks. The packet filter rules might look something like this:</P>

<PRE># lan0
allow ip from 172.16.1.0/24 to any via lan0
deny ip from any to any via lan0
# lan1
allow ip from 10.0.0.0/16 to any via lan1
deny ip from any to any via lan1</PRE>

<IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="257" SRC="images/0596001622/figs/SQ_0902.gif" ALT="figs/SQ_0902.gif"></CENTER>

<P class="docText">Now consider what happens when the router and Squid box on lan1 are
configured to intercept HTTP connections coming from lan0. Squid
pretends to be the origin server, which means that the TCP packets
carrying response data from Squid back to the users have spoofed
source addresses. These lan0 filter rules cause the router to deny
these packets. To make interception caching work, the network
administrator must remove the lan0 rules. This, in turn, leaves the
network vulnerable to being the source of denial-of-service attacks.</P>

<P class="docText">As I explained in the previous section, clients must make DNS queries
before opening a connection. This may be undesirable or difficult in
certain firewall environments. A host whose HTTP traffic you want to
intercept must be able to query the DNS. Clients that know they are
using a proxy (due to manual configuration or proxy
auto-configuration, for example) don't usually try
to resolve hostnames. Instead, they simply forward full URLs to
Squid, and it becomes Squid's job to look up origin
server IP addresses.</P>

<P class="docText">Another little problem is that Squid accepts connections for any
destination IP address. Consider, for example, a web site that still
has a DNS entry even though the site and server have been taken down.
Squid accepts the TCP connection for this bogus site. The client
believes the site is up and running, because it's
connection is established. When Squid fails to connect to the origin
server, it is forced to return an error message.</P>

<P class="docText">In case it's not clear, HTTP interception can be
tricky and difficult to get working the first time. A number of
different components must all work together and be correctly
configured. Furthermore, it can be difficult to recreate the entire
configuration from memory. I strongly encourage you to set up a test
environment before attempting this on a production system. Once you
get it all working, be sure to document every little step.</P>
