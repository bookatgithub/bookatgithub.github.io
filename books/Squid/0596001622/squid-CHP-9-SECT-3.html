a Unix system that is also your router (or perhaps bridge), as shown

<P class="docText">Clients are connected to port 1, the connection to the Internet is
via port 2, and Squid is on port 3. The following lines are the
relevant output of a <I>/cfg/dump</I> command on the
switch. You don't necessarily need to type all of
these lines. Furthermore, some of the commands may have changed for
newer versions of Alteon's software. Note that
Alteon calls this feature Web Cache Redirection (WCR).
Here's the process, step by step:</P>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">First, you must give the Alteon switch an IP address. This seems
necessary so that the switch can perform health checks with Squid:</P><PRE>/cfg/ip/if 1
        ena
        addr 172.16.102.1
        mask 255.255.255.0
        broad 172.16.102.255</PRE></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Alteon's WCR is a feature of its Server Load
Balancing (SLB) configuration. Thus, you need to enable SLB features
on the switch with this command:</P><PRE>/cfg/slb
        on</PRE></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">Next, you define a real server with Squid's IP
address:</P><PRE>/cfg/slb/real 1
        ena
        rip 172.16.102.66</PRE></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">You must also define a group and make the real server a member:</P><PRE>/cfg/slb/group 1
        health tcp
        add 1</PRE></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">The next step is to define two filters. The first filter matches HTTP
connections—TCP packets with destination port 80—and
redirects them to a server in group 1. The second filter matches all
other packets and forwards them normally:</P><PRE>/cfg/slb/filt 1
        ena
        action redir
        sip any
        smask 0.0.0.0

        proto any</PRE></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">The final step is to configure specific switch ports for SLB. On port
1, you enable client processing (this is where the clients connect),
and add the two filters. On the second port you need only configure
it for servers (i.e., the upstream Internet connection):</P><PRE>/cfg/slb/port 1
        client ena
        filt ena
        add 1

        server ena</PRE></span></LI></OL></span>

<P class="docText">To verify that HTTP interception is configured and working correctly,
you can use the commands under the <TT>/stats/slb</TT> and
<TT>/info/slb</TT> menus. The
<TT>/info/slb/dump</TT> command is a quick and easy way to
see the entire SLB configuration:</P>

<P class="docText">In this output, notice that the switch says Squid is reachable via
port 3 and that the health checks show Squid is
<TT>up</TT>. You can also see that filter 1 has been
applied to port 1, where the clients connect. In the Port state
section, port 1 is designated as a place where clients connect, and
port 2 is similarly marked as a server port.</P>

<P class="docText">The <TT>/stats/slb/real</TT> command shows a handful of

connections). The Total sessions counter should increase if you
execute the command again.</P>

the same information:</P>

you'll see later, my examples have Squid running on
port 3128. The packet filtering rules actually change the

<H5 class="docSection3Title">9.3.2.5 A comment on HTTP servers and health checks</H5>

<P class="docText">I've set up these examples so that the
<A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1551"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1552"></A>router/switch forwards
packets without changing the destination TCP port. The packet
filtering rules that I'll cover in <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-9-SECT-4.html#squid-CHP-9-SECT-4">Section 9.4</A> change the destination port.
An interesting problem arises when you also run an HTTP server on the
Squid box.</P>

<P class="docText">To run an HTTP server on port 80 while running Squid on port 3128,
your packet filter configuration must have a special rule that
accepts TCP connections for the HTTP server. Otherwise, the
connection gets diverted to Squid. The special rule is simple to
construct. If the destination port is 80, and the destination address
is the server's, accept the packet normally. All the
intercepted packets have foreign destination addresses, so they
won't match the special rule.</P>

<P class="docText">However, when the router/switch makes an HTTP health check, it
connects to the server's IP address. Thus, the
health-check packet matches the special rule and
isn't diverted to Squid. The router/switch is
checking the health of the wrong server. If the HTTP server is down,
but Squid is up (or vice versa), the health check will be wrong.</P>

<P class="docText">If you find yourself in this situation, you have a few options:</P>

<UL><LI><P class="docList">Don't run an HTTP server on the Squid host.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Add a specific packet filtering rule that diverts TCP health check
connections from the router/switch to Squid.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Configure your router/switch to change the destination port to 3128.</P></LI><LI><P class="docList">Disable layer four health checks.</P></LI></UL>

<P class="docText">Policy routing isn't that
<A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1553"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1554"></A>different from
what I've talked about with layer four switches. It
is implemented in routing products made by Cisco and others. The
primary difference is that policy routing doesn't
include any health checking. Thus, if Squid becomes overloaded or
fails entirely, the router continues to forward packets to Squid,
rather than route them directly to origin servers. Policy routing
requires that Squid be on one of the router's
directly connected subnets.</P>

<P class="docText">In this example, I'm using a Cisco 7204 router
running IOS Version 12.0(5)T. The network configuration is the same
as the previous example, shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-9-FIG-5">Figure 9-5</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">The first configuration step is to define an <span class="docEmphasis">access
list</span> that matches port 80 packets coming from clients. You
must make sure that port 80 packets coming from Squid
aren't reintercepted. One way to do this is with a
specific rule that denies packets coming from Squid, followed by a
rule that allows all others:</P>

<PRE>access-list 110 deny tcp host 172.16.102.66 any eq www
access-list 110 permit tcp any any eq www</PRE>

<P class="docText">Alternatively, if Squid and your users are on different subnets, you
can permit only those packets that originate from the client network:</P>

<PRE>access-list 110 permit tcp 10.102.0.0 0.0.255.255 any eq www</PRE>

<P class="docText">The next step is to define a <span class="docEmphasis">route map</span>. This is
where you tell the router where to forward the intercepted packets:</P>

<PRE>route-map proxy-redirect permit 10
 match ip address 110
 set ip next-hop 172.16.102.66</PRE>

<P class="docText">Those commands say, "If the IP address matches
access-list 110, forward the packet to
172.16.102.66." The <TT>10</TT> on the
<TT>route-map</TT> line is a sequence number in case you

interfaces where your clients connect:</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">9.3.4 Web Cache Coordination Protocol</H4>

<P class="docText">Cisco's answer to layer four
<A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1555"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1556"></A>switching technology
(before they acquired Arrowpoint) is the Web Cache Coordination
Protocol (WCCP).<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-9-FNOTE-2">[2]</A></sup> WCCP is
different from the typical layer four interception in a couple of
ways.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-FNOTE-2">[2]</A></sup> At various times it has also been
called Web Cache Control Protocol.</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText">First, intercepted packets are encapsulated <A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1557"></A>with GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation).
This simply allows them to traverse subnets, which means Squid
doesn't need to be directly connected to the router.
Because they are encapsulated, the Squid host must unencapsulate
them. Not all Unix systems have the code for unwrapping GRE packets.</P>

<P class="docText">The second difference is in how the router decides to spread the load
among multiple caches. In fact, the router doesn't
make this decision, the cache does. When a router has a group of
WCCP-enabled caches, one nominates itself to be the leader. The
leader decides how to spread the load and informs the router. This is
an extra step that must occur before the router can redirect any
connections.</P>

<P class="docText">Because WCCP uses GRE, the router may be forced to fragment large TCP
packets from HTTP requests. Fortunately, this
shouldn't occur very often because most HTTP
requests are smaller than the Ethernet MTU size (1500 octets). The
default TCP and IP packet headers are 20 octets each, which means an
Ethernet frame can carry 1460 octets of actual data. GRE
encapsulation adds 20 octets for the GRE header, plus another 20 for
the second IP header. Thus a normal 1500-octet TCP/IP packet from the
client becomes 1540 octets after encapsulation. This is too large to
transmit in a single Ethernet frame, so the router fragments the
original packet into two packets.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">9.3.4.1 WCCPv1</H5>

<P class="docText">The configuration examples in this section were tested on a Cisco
7204 running IOS Version 12.0(5)T. The network configuration is the
same as shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#squid-CHP-9-FIG-5">Figure 9-5</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">First, enter these two lines in the IOS configuration to enable WCCP
for the router:</P>

<PRE>ip wccp version 1
ip wccp web-cache</PRE>

<P class="docText">Second, you must enable WCCP on individual router interfaces. You
should do this only on interfaces where HTTP packets leave the
router. In other words, select interfaces that connect to origin
servers or your Internet gateway:</P>

<PRE>interface Ethernet0/1
 ip address 172.16.102.129 255.255.255.192
 ip wccp web-cache redirect out</PRE>

<P class="docText">Be sure to save your configuration changes.</P>

<P class="docText">You may need to use an access list to prevent interception for
certain web sites. You can also use the access list to prevent
forwarding loops. For example:</P>

<PRE>! don't re-intercept connections coming from Squid:
access-list 112 deny   tcp host 172.16.102.66 any eq www

! don't intercept this broken web site
access-list 112 deny   tcp any 192.16.8.7 255.255.255.255 eq www

! allow other HTTP traffic
access-list 110 permit tcp any any eq www

ip wccp web-cache redirect-list 112</PRE>

<P class="docText">The router doesn't send any traffic to Squid until
Squid announces itself to the router. I explain how to configure
Squid for WCCP in <A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-9-SECT-5.html#squid-CHP-9-SECT-5.1">Section 9.5.1</A>.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">9.3.4.2 WCCPv2</H5>

<P class="docText">The standard Squid distribution currently only supports WCCPv1.
However, you can find a patch for WCCPv2 on the <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://devel.squid-cache.org/">http://devel.squid-cache.org/</A> site. This code
is still experimental.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that the GRE packets sent from the router to Squid contain an
additional four octets. WCCPv2 inserts a redirect header between the
GRE header, and the encapsulated IP packet. You may need to modify
your kernel code to account for this additional header.</P>

<H5 class="docSection3Title">9.3.4.3 Debugging</H5>

<P class="docText">IOS provides a couple of commands to monitor and debug WCCP. The
<I>show ip wccp web-cache</I> command provides some basic
information:</P>

<PRE>router#show ip wccp web-cache
Global WCCP information:

<P class="docText">For a few more details, add the word <TT>detail</TT> to the
end of the previous command:</P>

<PRE>router#show ip wccp web-cache detail
WCCP Cache-Engine information:

<P class="docText">Here you can see Squid's IP address and state. If
more than one cache speaks WCCP to the router, the hash assignment
information should look different. Most likely, each cache receives
an equal proportion of the hash buckets.</P>

<P class="docText">Note that the detailed output has a Protocol Version line with a
different value than the first command. Unfortunately, the word
"version" is overloaded. The
<I>show ip wccp web-cache</I> command appears to report
the WCCP protocol major version number (i.e., 1 or 2), while the
<I>detail</I> version seems to be a different (perhaps
internal, or minor version) number that matches <A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1558"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1559"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1560"></A>the value of
