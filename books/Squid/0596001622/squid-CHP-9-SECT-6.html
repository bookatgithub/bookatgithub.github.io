<P class="docText">HTTP interception is complicated
<A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1582"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1583"></A><A NAME="squid-CHP-9-ITERM-1584"></A>because
many different devices must all work correctly together. To help you
track down problems, here's a trouble-shooting check
list:</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Are client packets going through the router/switch?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This should be obvious for simple networks. You can trace the cables
and watch the activity lights blink. In a large, complex network,
however, packets may be taking an alternate path. If your
organization is large enough to have a network sniffer, you may want
to observe the traffic on the link that should carry requests from
web clients. A low-tech approach is to disconnect the link in
question and see if it affects the client's web
browsing.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Is the router/switch configured properly?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">You may want to double-check your router/switch configuration. If you
configured specific interfaces, did you get the right ones?</P>

<P class="docList">Is your new configuration actually <span class="docEmphasis">running</span> on
the device? Perhaps the router/switch was rebooted before you could
save the configuration. You may need to reboot before the changes
take effect.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Can the switch/router talk to the Squid host?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Can you ping Squid from the router/switch? Most layer four
interception configurations require that the device and Squid be on
the same subnet. Log into the router/switch, and make sure you can
ping Squid's IP address.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Does the switch/router believe that Squid is up?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Many traffic interception devices don't send traffic
to Squid unless they know it's healthy. Use the
debugging commands to view Squid's health status.
You may find that a layer three health check (e.g., ICMP ping) is
simpler than a layer four check (e.g., HTTP), and more likely to make
the network device mark Squid as up.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Is Squid actually running?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Double-check that Squid is really running, especially if the system
has recently been rebooted.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Are packets arriving at the Squid host?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">You should be able to see intercepted TCP connections with
<I>tcpdump</I>. Here's an example:</P>

<PRE># tcpdump -n -i eth0 port 80</PRE>

<P class="docList">If you use WCCP, check for GRE packets coming from the router:</P>

<PRE># tcpdump -n -i eth0 ip proto gre</PRE>

<P class="docList">If you don't see any output from
<I>tcpdump</I>, the router/switch is probably not sending
anything. In that case, return to the previous suggestions.</P>

<P class="docList">Note, if the device is using layer four health checks, you should see
those in the <I>tcpdump</I> output. Health checks come
from the router/switch IP address, so they should be easy to spot. If
you see health checks, but no other traffic, it probably means the
router/switch is interpreting Squid's reply as
unhealthy. For example, the device may want to see a 200 (OK)
response, but Squid returns an error, such as 401 (Unauthorized) or
404 (Not Found). You may want to run <I>tail -f</I> on
the <I>access.log</I>.</P>

</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Did you enable IP forwarding?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Double-check that Squid's operating system is
configured to forward IP packets. If not, the host may drop
intercepted packets because the destination IP address
isn't local.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Did you configure the packet filter?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Make sure that the packet filter (i.e., <I>ipfw</I>,
<I>iptables</I>, <I>pf</I>, etc.) is
configured correctly. When everything is working well, you should be
able to run the command periodically that displays the filtering
rules and see the counters increase. For example:</P>

<PRE># ipfw show 300 ; sleep 3; ipfw show 300
00300  86216 8480458 fwd 127.0.0.1,3128 tcp from any to any 80 in
00300  86241 8482240 fwd 127.0.0.1,3128 tcp from any to any 80 in</PRE>

<P class="docList">Note that in this example on FreeBSD, the packet and byte counters
(second and third columns) are being incremented.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Is the loopback interface up and configured?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">If you have a rule to forward/redirect packets to 127.0.0.1, make
sure that the loopback (e.g., <span class="docEmphasis">lo0</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">lo</span>) interface is up and configured. If not, the
kernel may simply skip the forward/redirect rule.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Are WCCP/GRE packets being unencapsulated correctly?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">If you use WCCP, make sure that the GRE packets are being
unencapsulated. If, for some reason, your system
doesn't know what to do with GRE packets, it
probably increments the "unknown/unsupported
protocol" counter in <I>netstat -s</I>
output:</P>

<PRE># netstat -s | grep unknown
        46 packets for unknown/unsupported protocol</PRE>

<P class="docList">If your OS has a GRE interface, run <I>netstat -i</I>
every so often and look for increasing packet counts:</P>

<PRE># netstat -in | grep ^gre0
Name    Mtu Network       Address              Ipkts Ierrs    Opkts Oerrs  Coll
gre0   1476 &lt;Link#4&gt;                          
304452     0        0     4     0</PRE>

<P class="docList">Also, try running <I>tcpdump</I> on the GRE interface:</P>

<PRE># tcpdump -n -i gre0</PRE>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Can Squid talk back to the clients?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">You may have a situation in which the router/switch is able to send
packets to Squid, but Squid can't send packets back
to the clients. This can happen if your firewall filter rules reject
those outgoing packets or if Squid just doesn't have
a route to the client addresses. To check for this condition, run
<I>netstat -n</I> and look for a lot of sockets in the
<TT>SYN_RCVD</TT> state:</P>

</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Are outgoing connections being intercepted?</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">If Squid can <I>ping</I> origin servers, and you still
see a lot of connections in the <TT>SYN_SENT</TT> state,
the router/switch may be intercepting Squid's
outgoing TCP connections. In some cases, Squid can detect such
forwarding loops, and it writes a warning message to
<I>cache.log</I>. Such a forwarding loop can quickly
exhaust all of Squid's file descriptors, which also
generates a warning in <I>cache.log</I>.</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">If you suspect this problem, use the <I>squidclient</I>
program to make some simple HTTP requests. For example, this command
makes an HTTP request directly to the origin server:</P>

<PRE>% /usr/local/squid/bin/squidclient -p 80 -h slashdot.org /</PRE>

<P class="docText">If this command succeeds, you should see a bunch of ugly HTML from
the Slashdot site on your screen. You can then try the same request
through Squid:</P>

<PRE>% /usr/local/squid/bin/squidclient -r -p 3128 -h 127.0.0.1 http://slashdot.org/</PRE>

<P class="docText">Again, you should see some HTML on your screen. If not check for
error messages in <I>cache.log</I>. If you see
forwarding loop errors, you need to reconfigure your router/switch so
that it allows Squid's outgoing connections to pass
without being intercepted.</P>
