<H3 class="docSection1Title" id="225793-881">About This Book</H3>
<P class="docText">I started the Squid project eight years ago while working at the
National Laboratory for Applied Network Research and the University
of California. Back then I certainly enjoyed writing code and fixing
bugs but always felt bad about the lack of decent documentation. This
book is my attempt to rectify that situation. It's
been a long time coming and almost didn't happen.
Like they say, "better late than
never!"</P>

<P class="docText">This book is written for those who are tasked with setting up and
maintaining one or more Squid caches. If you're new
to Squid, I'll show you how to download, compile,
and install the code. Those of you who have been using Squid for a
while will be more interested in the later chapters, where I talk
about disk cache performance, modifying requests, surrogate mode,
caching hierarchies, monitoring Squid, and more.</P>

<P class="docText">In order to use this book, you should have a basic knowledge of Unix
systems. Many of the book's examples are based on
free operating systems, such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
I also have some tips for Solaris users. If you're
more comfortable with Windows systems, you can use Squid under a Unix
emulator or give the native NT port a try.</P>

<P class="docText">Here's an overview of the book's
contents:</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-1.html#squid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Introduction</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This chapter introduces you to Squid and web caching. I give a brief
history of the project, and a few notes on our future work. I explain
how you can find additional support and information, including a FAQ,
on the Squid web site.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-2.html#squid-CHP-2">Chapter 2</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Getting Squid</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">In this chapter, I explain how and why you should download
Squid's source code. You may prefer to install a
precompiled binary or use a preconfigured package. I also talk about
staying up to date with Squid using the anonymous CVS server.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-3.html#squid-CHP-3">Chapter 3</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Compiling and Installing</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Assuming you've downloaded the source code, this
chapter explains how to configure and compile Squid. In some cases
you may need to tune your system before compiling Squid. For example,
your kernel may have relatively low file-descriptor limits that
affect Squid's performance.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-4.html#squid-CHP-4">Chapter 4</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Configuration Guide for the Eager</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Here, I give a brief introduction to Squid's
configuration file. If you are the impatient type and
can't wait to start using Squid, this chapter will
leave you with a minimal configuration file you can start playing
with.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-5.html#squid-CHP-5">Chapter 5</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Running Squid</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">In this chapter, I explain how to run Squid for the first time and
how to test Squid in a terminal window. Following that, I suggest a
number of ways to configure your system so that Squid starts each
time it boots. I also explain how to reconfigure Squid while it is
running and how to safely shut it down.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-6.html#squid-CHP-6">Chapter 6</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">All About Access Controls</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">I talk extensively about access controls in this chapter. Squid has a
powerful collection of access control features and a number of
different rule sets that determine how requests and responses are
treated. This is an important chapter because a mistake in your
access controls may leave your cache, or even internal systems,
vulnerable to abuse from outsiders.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-7.html#squid-CHP-7">Chapter 7</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Disk Cache Basics</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This chapter is about Squid's primary function:
storing cached responses on disk. I explain how to configure the disk
cache, including replacement policies and freshness controls. I also
show you how to manually remove unwanted objects from the cache.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-8.html#squid-CHP-8">Chapter 8</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Advanced Disk Cache Topics</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">In this chapter, I explain how to improve the performance of
Squid's disk cache. I'll talk about
Squid's different storage schemes and a number of
filesystem tuning options that may help. If your Squid cache handles
a relatively light load, you probably don't need to
worry about disk performance.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-9.html#squid-CHP-9">Chapter 9</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Interception Caching</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Here, I explain how to configure Squid for HTTP interception,
sometimes also called transparent caching. Actually, configuring
Squid is the easy part. The difficulty comes from setting up a router
or switch on your network and the host from which Squid is running. I
explain how to configure networking equipment from Cisco, Alteon,
Foundry, and Extreme. I'll also show you how to
configure your operating system (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and
Solaris) for HTTP interception. Finally, I talk about WCCP.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-10.html#squid-CHP-10">Chapter 10</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Talking to Other Squids</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">In this chapter, I cover the ins and outs of cache cooperation,
including meshes, arrays, and hierarchies. You may also find it
useful if you simply need to forward requests from Squid to another
proxy or intermediary. I'll talk about the various
intercache protocols supported by Squid (ICP, HTCP, Cache Digests,
and CARP) and how Squid chooses the next-hop location for a given
cache miss.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-11.html#squid-CHP-11">Chapter 11</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Redirectors</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Redirectors are the best way to make Squid rewrite HTTP requests
before forwarding them. I describe the interface between Squid and a
redirector program so that you can write your own. I also present a
few of the more popular third-party redirectors available.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-12.html#squid-CHP-12">Chapter 12</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Authentication Helpers</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">In this chapter, I explain how Squid interfaces with external
authentication databases such as LDAP, NT domain controllers, and
password files. Squid comes with a number of authentication helpers
and understands Basic, Digest, and NTLM authentication credentials. I
also document the API for each, in case you want to develop your own
helper.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-13.html#squid-CHP-13">Chapter 13</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Log Files</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">I cover Squid's various log files in this chapter,
including <I>access.log</I>,
<I>store.log</I>, <I>cache.log,</I> and
others. I explain what each log file contains and how you should
periodically maintain them.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-14.html#squid-CHP-14">Chapter 14</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Monitoring Squid</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This chapter provides a lot of information on monitoring
Squid's operation. I cover both SNMP and
Squid's own cache manager interface.
You'll find it useful for both long-term monitoring
and short-term problem diagnosis.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-15.html#squid-CHP-15">Chapter 15</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Server Accelerator Mode</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Squid's server accelerator mode is useful in a
number of situations. You can use it to boost your origin
server's poor performance, as a firewall to protect
the server, or even to build your own content delivery network. I
show how to set up Squid and make sure that outsiders
can't abuse your service.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-CHP-16.html#squid-CHP-16">Chapter 16</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Debugging and Troubleshooting</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">The book's final chapter explains how to debug and
troubleshoot problems with Squid. You may find that some sites, or
some user agents, don't work properly with Squid. I
show how to isolate and reproduce the problem and how to present the
information to Squid developers for assistance.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-A.html#squid-APP-A">Appendix A</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Config File Reference</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This appendix is a reference guide for each of
Squid's 200 configuration file directives. Each has
a description, syntax, defaults, and examples.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-B.html#squid-APP-B">Appendix B</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">The Memory Cache</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This brief appendix explains a little about Squid's
memory cache.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-C.html#squid-APP-C">Appendix C</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Delay Pools</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">You can use Squid's delay pools feature to limit
bandwidth consumed by web surfers. I explain how the delay pools work
and provide a number of example configurations.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-D.html#squid-APP-D">Appendix D</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Filesystem Performance Benchmarks</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">In this appendix, I present the results of numerous filesystem
benchmarks. These may help you make informed decisions regarding
particular operating systems, filesystem features, and
Squid's storage techniques.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-E.html#squid-APP-E">Appendix E</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Squid on Windows</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Have a look at this appendix if you'd like to run
Squid on your Windows box. I talk about using Cygwin and about a
native port of Squid, called SquidNT.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><span class="docPubcolor"><A class="docLink" HREF="squid-APP-F.html#squid-APP-F">Appendix F</A>, <span class="docEmphasis">Configuring Squid Clients</span></span></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">This appendix contains information on how to configure various user
agents to use Squid. I talk about manual configuration, environment
variables, Proxy Auto-Configuration functions, and the Web Proxy Auto
Discovery protocol.</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P class="docText">As I'm finishing up this book, the latest stable
version is Squid-2.5.STABLE4, and the development version is
Squid-3.0. Perhaps the most important difference between the two is
that Squid-3 is being rewritten in C++. You should find that most
things are backward-compatible, although a few new configuration
directives have been created. Please read the release notes carefully
if you use Squid-3.0 or later.</P>

<P class="docText">I have created a web site for the book, located at <A class="docLink" target="_blank" HREF="http://squidbook.org/">http://squidbook.org/</A>. There, you will find
errata, supplemental information, and links to online resources.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title">Topics Not Covered</H4>

<P class="docText">Due to a lack of time and space, there are some topics I was unable
to cover in this book; they include:</P>

<DL class="docList"><br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Non-HTTP protocols</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">You'll find that I mostly talk about HTTP, even
though Squid also supports FTP, Gopher, and some other relatively
obscure protocols.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Customizing error messages</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Squid's error messages can be customized and the
source distribution includes versions of the error messages in a
number of different languages. You can probably figure out how to
customize the error messages by modifying the default pages or by
reading Squid's source code.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">Load balancing Squids</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">Load balancing is a popular way to increase the capacity of a caching
service. Refer to one of the load balancing books mentioned in the
following section if necessary.</P>
</DD>
<br><p><DT><I><span class="docPubcolor">What is cachable</span></I></DT></p>
<DD>
<P class="docList">HTTP has a number of somewhat complicated rules for determining what
may, or may not be, cached, and for how long. Refer to <span class="docEmphasis">Web
Caching,</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">HTTP: The Definitive Guide
</span>(for more information, see the next section).</P>
