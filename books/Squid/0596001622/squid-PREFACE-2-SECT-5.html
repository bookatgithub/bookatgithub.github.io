<P class="docText">Looking back at the events and people that allowed me to write this
book makes me feel extremely humble and grateful.
I'm so happy to have been a part of the Harvest
project with Mike Schwartz, Peter Danzig, and the others. That led
directly to my work with kc claffy and Hans-Werner Braun at
NLANR/UCSD. The Squid project would have never been at all without
their support, and the grant from the National Science Foundation.</P>

<P class="docText">I'm also very thankful for all the hard work put in
by the small crew of Squid developers: Henrik Nordstr&ouml;m,
Robert Collins, Adrian Chadd, and everyone else who has contributed
time and code to the project. And I'm sorry that you
ever had to read and/or fix any ugly code I wrote.</P>

<P class="docText">To all the reviewers who read the drafts—Joe Cooper, Scott
Pepple, Robert Collins, and Adrian Chadd—thanks for finding my
mistakes and suggesting ways to make the book better. I also owe so
much to the people at O'Reilly for making the book
possible, and for making it all come together. My editors Tatiana
Diaz and Nat Torkington, the production editor Mary Anne Mayo, the
graphic designer Melanie Wang, the illustrator, Rob Romano, the XML
mungers Andrew Savikas and Joe Wizda, and the countless other folks
working behind the scenes for me.</P>

<P class="docText">To my good friend, and business partner, Alex Rousskov: thanks for
giving me the time and freedom to see this little project through.
Finally, to the members of my new family, Annie and Blooey, thanks
for putting up with the late nights. Can I make it up to you with
extra back scratches?</P>
