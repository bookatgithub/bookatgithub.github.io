<P class="docText">Look at the problem scenarios again and you will notice that they all fall into one of two types: Either information is being located (search) or information is being located and edited (replace). In fact, at its simplest, that is all that regular expressions are ever used for: search and replace. Every regular expression either matches text (performing a search) or matches and replaces text (performing a replace).</P>
<A NAME="ch01lev2sec1"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title"> RegEx Searches</H4>
<P class="docText">Regular expressions are used in searches when the text to be searched for is highly dynamic, as in searching for <TT>car</TT> in the scenario described earlier. For starters, you need to locate <TT>car</TT> or <TT>CAR</TT> or <TT>Car</TT> or even <TT>CaR</TT>; that's the easy part (many search tools are capable of performing searches that are not case sensitive). The trickier part is ensuring that <TT>scar</TT>, <TT>carry</TT>, and <TT>incarcerate</TT> are not matched. Some more sophisticated editors have Match Only Whole Word options, but many don't, and you may not be making this change in a document you are editing. Using a regular expression for the search, instead of just the text <TT>car</TT>, solves the problem.<A NAME="idd1e923"></A><A NAME="idd1e926"></A></P>

<P class="docText">It is worth noting that testing for equality (for example, <span class="docEmphasis">does this user-specified email address match this regular expression?</span>) is a search operation. The entire user-provided string is being searched for a match (in contrast to a substring search, which is what searches usually are).</P>
<A NAME="ch01lev2sec2"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title"> RegEx Replaces</H4>
<P class="docText">Regular expression searches are immensely powerful, very useful, and not that difficult to learn. As such, many of the lessons and examples that you will run into are matches. However, the real power of regex is seen in replace operations, such as in the earlier scenario in which you replace URLs with clickable URLs. For starters, this requires that you be able to locate URLs within text (perhaps searching for strings that start with <TT>http://</TT> or <TT>https://</TT> and ending with a period or a comma or whitespace). Then it also requires that you replace the found URL with two occurrences of the matched string with embedded HTML so that<A NAME="idd1e965"></A><A NAME="idd1e968"></A></P>

&lt;A HREF="http://www.forta.com"&gt;http://www.forta.com/&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>
<P class="docText">The Search and Replace option in most applications could not handle this type of replace operation, but this task is incredibly easy using a regular expression.<A NAME="idd1e988"></A><A NAME="idd1e991"></A></P>
