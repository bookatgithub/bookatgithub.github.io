<P class="docText">Whitespace compression can be characterized most generally as "removing what we are not interested in." Even though this technique is technically a lossy-compression technique, it is still useful for many types of data representations we find in the real world. For example, even though HTML is far more readable in a text editor if indentation and vertical spacing is added, none of this "whitespace" should make any difference to how the HTML document is rendered by a Web browser. If you happen to know that an HTML document is destined only for a Web browser (or for a robot/spider), then it might be a good idea to take out all the whitespace to make it transmit faster and occupy less space in storage. What we remove in whitespace compression never really had any functional purpose to start with.</P>
<P class="docText">In the case of our example in this article, it is possible to remove quite a bit from the described report. The row of "=" across the top adds nothing functional, nor do the "-" within numbers, nor the spaces between them. These are all useful for a person reading the original report, but do not matter once we think of it as data. What we remove is not precisely whitespace in traditional terms, but the intent is the same.</P>
<P class="docText">Whitespace compression is extremely "cheap" to perform. It is just a matter of reading a stream of data and excluding a few specific values from the output stream. In many cases, no "decompression" step is involved at all. But even where we would wish to re-create something close to the original somewhere down the data stream, it should require little in terms of CPU or memory. What we reproduce may or may not be exactly what we started with, depending on just what rules and constraints were involved in the original. An HTML page typed by a human in a text editor will probably have spacing that is idiosyncratic. Then again, automated tools often produce "reasonable" indentation and spacing of HTML. In the case of the rigid report format in our example, there is no reason that the original representation could not be precisely produced by a "decompressing formatter" down the data stream.</P>
