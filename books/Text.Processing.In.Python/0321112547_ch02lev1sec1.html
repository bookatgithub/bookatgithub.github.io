<A NAME="ch02lev2sec1"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">2.1.1 Problem: Quickly sorting lines on custom criteria</H4>
<P class="docText">Sorting is one of the real meat-and-potatoes algorithms of text processing and, in fact, of most programming. Fortunately for Python developers, the native <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>[].sort</TT></span> method is extraordinarily fast. Moreover, Python lists with almost any heterogeneous objects as elements can be sorted—Python cannot rely on the uniform arrays of a language like C (an unfortunate exception to this general power was introduced in recent Python versions where comparisons of complex numbers raise a <TT>TypeError</TT>; and <TT>[1+1j,2+2j].sort()</TT> dies for the same reason; Unicode strings in lists can cause similar problems).</P>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRoman">S<span class="docEmphSmaller">EE</span> A<span class="docEmphSmaller">LSO</span></span>: 
complex <span class="docEmphasis">22</span>;</p>
<P class="docText">The list sort method is wonderful when you want to sort items in their "natural" order—or in the order that Python considers natural, in the case of items of varying types. Unfortunately, a lot of times, you want to sort things in "unnatural" orders. For lines of text, in particular, any order that is not simple alphabetization of the lines is "unnatural." But often text lines contain meaningful bits of information in positions other than the first character position: A last name may occur as the second word of a list of people (for example, with first name as the first word); an IP address may occur several fields into a server log file; a money total may occur at position 70 of each line; and so on. What if you want to sort lines based on this style of meaningful order that Python doesn't quite understand?</P>
<P class="docText">The list sort method <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>[].sort()</TT></span> supports an optional custom comparison function argument. The job this function has is to return -1 if the first thing should come first, return 0 if the two things are equal order-wise, and return 1 if the first thing should come second. The built-in function <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>cmp()</TT></span> does this in a manner identical to the default <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>[].sort()</TT></span> (except in terms of speed, <TT>1st.sort()</TT> is much faster than <TT>1st.sort(cmp)</TT>). For short lists and quick solutions, a custom comparison function is probably the best thing. In a lot of cases, you can even get by with an in-line <TT>lambda</TT> function as the custom comparison function, which is a pleasant and handy idiom.</P>
<P class="docText">When it comes to speed, however, use of custom comparison functions is fairly awful. Part of the problem is Python's function call overhead, but a lot of other factors contribute to the slowness. Fortunately, a technique called "Schwartzian Transforms" can make for much faster custom sorts. Schwartzian Transforms are named after Randal Schwartz, who proposed the technique for working with Perl; but the technique is equally applicable to Python.</P>
<P class="docText">The pattern involved in the Schwartzian Transform technique consists of three steps (these can more precisely be called the Guttman-Rosler Transform, which is based on the Schwartzian Transform):</P>
<A NAME="ch02pr01"></A>


<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" START="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal" value="1"><P class="docText">Transform the list in a reversible way into one that sorts "naturally."</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal" value="2"><P class="docText">Call Python's native <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>[].sort()</TT></span> method.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal" value="3"><P class="docText">Reverse the transformation in (1) to restore the original list items (in new sorted order).</P></span></LI></OL></span>
<P class="docText">The reason this technique works is that, for a list of size N, it only requires O(2N) transformation operations, which is easy to amortize over the necessary O(N log N) compare/flip operations for large lists. The sort dominates computational time, so anything that makes the sort more efficient is a win in the limit case (this limit is reached quickly).</P>
<P class="docText">Below is an example of a simple, but plausible, custom sorting algorithm. The sort is on the fourth and subsequent words of a list of input lines. Lines that are shorter than four words sort to the bottom. Running the test against a file with about 20,000 lines—about 1 megabyte—performed the Schwartzian Transform sort in less than 2 seconds, while taking over 12 seconds for the custom comparison function sort (outputs were verified as identical). Any number of factors will change the exact relative timings, but a better than six times gain can generally be expected.</P>

<A NAME="ch02lev2sec2"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">2.1.2 Problem: Reformatting paragraphs of text</H4>
<P class="docText">While I mourn the decline of plaintext ASCII as a communication format—and its eclipse by unnecessarily complicated and large (and often proprietary) formats—there is still plenty of life left in text files full of prose. READMEs, HOWTOs, email, Usenet posts, and this book itself are written in plaintext (or at least something close enough to plaintext that generic processing techniques are valuable). Moreover, many formats like HTML and <IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="17" src="FILES/latex.gif" ALT="graphics/latex.gif"> are frequently enough hand-edited that their plaintext appearance is important.</P>
<P class="docText">One task that is extremely common when working with prose text files is reformatting paragraphs to conform to desired margins. Python 2.3 adds the module <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>textwrap</TT></span>, which performs more limited reformatting than the code below. Most of the time, this task gets done within text editors, which are indeed quite capable of performing the task. However, sometimes it would be nice to automate the formatting process. The task is simple enough that it is slightly surprising that Python has no standard module function to do this. There <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> the class <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>formatter.DumbWriter</TT></span>, or the possibility of inheriting from and customizing <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>formatter.AbstractWriter</TT></span>. These classes are discussed in <A class="docLink" HREF="0321112547_ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</A>; but frankly, the amount of customization and sophistication needed to use these classes and their many methods is way out of proportion for the task at hand.</P>
<P class="docText">Below is a simple solution that can be used either as a command-line tool (reading from STDIN and writing to STDOUT) or by import to a larger application.</P>

<P class="docText">A number of enhancements are left to readers, if needed. You might want to allow hanging indents or indented first lines, for example. Or paragraphs meeting certain criteria might not be appropriate for wrapping (e.g., headers). A custom application might also determine the input paragraphs differently, either by a different parsing of an input file, or by generating paragraphs internally in some manner.</P>
<A NAME="ch02lev2sec3"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">2.1.3 Problem: Column statistics for delimited or flat-record files</H4>
<P class="docText">Data feeds, DBMS dumps, log files, and flat-file databases all tend to contain ontologically similar records—one per line—with a collection of fields in each record. Usually such fields are separated either by a specified delimiter or by specific column positions where fields are to occur.</P>
<P class="docText">Parsing these structured text records is quite easy, and performing computations on fields is equally straightforward. But in working with a variety of such "structured text databases," it is easy to keep writing almost the same code over again for each variation in format and computation.</P>

<P class="docText">The example above includes some efficiency considerations that make it a good model for working with large data sets. In the first place, class <TT>FieldStats</TT> can (optionally) deal with a file-like object, rather than keeping the whole structured text database in memory. The generator <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>xreadlines.xreadlines()</TT></span> is an extremely fast and efficient file reader, but it requires Python 2.1+—otherwise use <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>FILE.readline()</TT></span> or <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>FILE.readlines()</TT></span> (for either memory or speed efficiency, respectively). Moreover, only the data that is actually of interest is collected into lists, in order to save memory. However, rather than require multiple passes to collect statistics on multiple fields, as many field columns and summary functions as wanted can be used in one pass.</P>

UUencoding is an older standard that developed around the need to transmit binary files over the Usenet and on BBSs. Binhex is a similar technique from the MacOS world. In recent years, base64—which is specified by RFC1521—has edged out the other styles of encoding. All of the techniques are basically 4/3 encodings—that is, four ASCII bytes are used to represent three binary bytes—but they differ somewhat in line ending and header conventions (as well as in the encoding as such). Quoted printable is yet another format, but of variable encoding length. In quoted printable encoding, most plain ASCII bytes are left unchanged, but a few special characters and all high-bit bytes are escaped.</P>
<P class="docText">Python provides modules for all the encoding styles mentioned. The high-level wrappers <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>uu</TT>, <TT>binhex</TT>, <TT>base64</TT></span>, and <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>quopri</TT></span> all operate on input and output file-like objects, encoding the data therein. They also each have slightly different method names and arguments. <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>binhex</TT></span>, for example, closes its output file after encoding, which makes it unusable in conjunction with a <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>cStringlO</TT></span> file-like object. All of the high-level encoders utilize the services of the low-level C module <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>binascii</TT>. <TT>binascii</TT></span>, in turn, implements the actual low-level block conversions, but assumes that it will be passed the right size blocks for a given encoding.</P>
<P class="docText">The standard library, therefore, does not contain quite the right intermediate-level functionality for when the goal is just encoding the binary data in arbitrary strings. It is easy to wrap that up, though:</P>

<P class="docText">Several of the design choices are somewhat arbitrary. Words have all their punctuation stripped to identify "real" words. But on the other hand, words are still case-sensitive, which may not be what is desired. The sorting functions <TT>first_things()</TT> and <TT>most_common()</TT> only return an initial sublist. Perhaps it would be better to return the whole list, and let the user slice the result. It is simple to customize around these sorts of issues, though.</P>
<A NAME="ch02lev2sec7"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">2.1.7 Problem: Reading a file backwards by record, line, or paragraph</H4>
<P class="docText">Reading a file line by line is a common task in Python, or in most any language. Files like server logs, configuration files, structured text databases, and others frequently arrange information into logical records, one per line. Very often, the job of a program is to perform some calculation on each record in turn.</P>
<P class="docText">Python provides a number of convenient methods on file-like objects for such line-by-line reading. <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>FILE.readlines()</TT></span> reads a whole file at once and returns a list of lines. The technique is very fast, but requires the whole contents of the file be kept in memory. For very large files, this can be a problem. <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>FILE.readline()</TT></span> is memory-friendly—it just reads a line at a time and can be called repeatedly until the EOF is reached—but it is also much slower. The best solution for recent Python versions is <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>xreadlines.xreadlines()</TT></span> or <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>FILE.xreadlines()</TT></span> in Python 2.1+. These techniques are memory-friendly, while still being fast and presenting a "virtual list" of lines (by way of Python's new generator/iterator interface).</P>
<P class="docText">The above techniques work nicely for reading a file in its natural order, but what if you want to start at the end of a file and work backwards from there? This need is frequently encountered when you want to read log files that have records appended over time (and when you want to look at the most recent records first). It comes up in other situations also. There is a very easy technique if memory usage is not an issue:</P>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; open('lines','w').write('\n'.join(['n' for n in range(100)]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; fp = open('lines')
&gt;&gt;&gt; lines = fp.readlines()
&gt;&gt;&gt; lines.reverse()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in lines [1:5]:
...     # Processing suite here
...     print line,
...
98
97
96
95
</pre>
<P class="docText">For large input files, however, this technique is not feasible. It would be nice to have something analogous to <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>xreadlines</TT></span> here. The example below provides a good starting point (the example works equally well for file-like objects).</P>

<P class="docText">Notice that <span class="docEmphasis">anything</span> could serve as a block delimiter. The constants provided just happened to work for lines and block paragraphs (and block paragraphs only with the current OS's style of line breaks). But other delimiters could be used. It would <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> be immediately possible to read backwards word-by-word—a space delimiter would come close, but would not be quite right for other whitespace. However, reading a line (and maybe reversing its words) is generally good enough.</P>
<P class="docText">Another enhancement is possible with Python 2.2+. Using the new <TT>yield</TT> keyword, <TT>read_backwards()</TT> could be programmed as an iterator rather than as a multi-call function. The performance will not differ significantly, but the function might be expressed more clearly (and a "list-like" interface like <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>FILE.readlines()</TT></span> makes the application's loop simpler).</P>
