<P class="docText">State machines, in a theoretical sense, underlay almost everything computer- and programming-related. But a Python programmer does not necessarily need to consider highly theoretical matters in writing programs. Nonetheless, there is a large class of ordinary programming problems where the best and most natural approach is to explicitly code a state machine as the solution. At heart, a state machine is just a way of thinking about the flow control in an application.</P>
<P class="docText">A parser is a specialized type of state machine that analyzes the components and meaning of structured texts. Generally a parser is accompanied by its own high-level description language that describes the states and transitions used by the implied state machine. The state machine is in turn applied to text obeying a "grammar."</P>
<P class="docText">In some text processing problems, the processing must be <span class="docEmphasis">stateful</span>: How we handle the next bit of text depends upon what we have done so far with the prior text. In some cases, statefulness can be naturally expressed using a parser grammar, but in other cases the state has more to do with the semantics of the prior text than with its syntax. That is, the issue of what grammatical properties a portion of a text has is generally orthogonal to the issue of what predicates it fulfills. Concretely, we might calculate some arithmetic result on numeric fields, or we might look up a name encountered in a text file in a database, before deciding how to proceed with the text processing. Where the parsing of a text depends on semantic features, a state machine is often a useful approach.</P>
<P class="docText">Implementing an elementary and generic state machine in Python is simple to do, and may be used for a variety of purposes. The third-party C-extension module <span class="docEmphasis"><TT>mx.TextTools</TT></span>, which is discussed later in this chapter, can also be used to create far faster state machine text processors.</P>
<A NAME="ch04lev2sec6"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">4.2.1 Understanding State Machines</H4>
<P class="docText">A much too accurate description of a state machine is that it is a directed graph, consisting of a set of nodes and a set of transition functions. Such a machine "runs" by responding to a series of events; each event is in the domain of the transition function of the "current" node, where the range is a subset of the nodes. The function return is a "next" (maybe self-identical) node. A subset of the nodes are end-states; if an end-state is reached, the machine stops.</P>
<P class="docText">An abstract mathematical description듧ike the one above들s of little use for most practical programming problems. Equally picayune is the observation that every program in an imperative programming language like Python is a state machine whose nodes are its source lines (but not really in a declarative듡unctional or constraint-based듧anguage such as Haskell, Scheme, or Prolog). Furthermore, every regular expression is logically equivalent to a state machine, and every parser implements an abstract state machine. Most programmers write lots of state machines without really thinking about it, but that fact provides little guidance to specific programming techniques.</P>
<P class="docText">An informal, heuristic definition is more useful than an abstract one. Often we encounter a program requirement that includes a handful of distinct ways of treating clusters of events. Furthermore, it is sometimes the case that individual events need to be put in a context to determine which type of treatment is appropriate (as opposed to each event being "self-identifying"). The state machines discussed in this introduction are high-level machines that are intended to express clearly the programming requirements of a class of problems. If it makes sense to talk about your programming problem in terms of categories of behavior in response to events, it is likely to be a good idea to program the solution in terms of explicit state machines.</P>
<A NAME="ch04lev2sec7"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">4.2.2 Text Processing State Machines</H4>
<P class="docText">One of the programming problems most likely to call for an explicit state machine is processing text files. Processing a text file very often consists of sequential reading of each chunk of a text file (typically either a character or a line), and doing something in response to each chunk read. In some cases, this processing is "stateless"듮hat is, each chunk has enough information internally to determine exactly what to do in response to that chunk of text. And in other cases, even though the text file is not 100 percent stateless, there is a very limited context to each chunk (for example, the line number might matter for the action taken, but not much else besides the line number). But in other common text processing problems, the text files we deal with are highly "stateful"듮he meaning of a chunk depends on what types of chunks preceded it (and maybe even on what chunks come next). Files like report files, mainframe data-feeds, human-readable texts, programming source files, and other sorts of text files are stateful. A very simple example of a stateful chunk is a line that might occur in a Python source file:*</P>
<pre>
myObject = SomeClass(this, that, other)
</pre>
<P class="docText">That line means something very different if it happens to be surrounded by these lines:</P>
<pre>
"""How to use SomeClass:
myObject = SomeClass(this, that, other)
"""
</pre>
<P class="docText">That is, we needed to know that we were in a "blockquote" <span class="docEmphasis">state</span> to determine that the line was a comment rather than an action. Of course, a program that deals with Python programs in a more general way will usually use a parser and grammar.</P>
<A NAME="ch04lev2sec8"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">4.2.3 When Not to Use a State Machine</H4>
<P class="docText">When we begin the task of writing a processor for any stateful text file, the first question we should ask ourselves is "What types of things do we expect to find in the file?" Each type of thing is a candidate for a state. These types should be several in number, but if the number is huge or indefinite, a state machine is probably not the right approach듨aybe some sort of database solution is appropriate. Or maybe the problem has not been formulated right if there appear to be that many types of things.</P>
<P class="docText">Moreover, we are not quite ready for a state machine yet; there may yet be a simpler approach. It might turn out that even though our text file is stateful there is an easy way to read in chunks where each chunk is a single type of thing. A state machine is really only worth implementing if the transitions between types of text require some calculation based on the content within a single state-block.</P>
<P class="docText">An example of a somewhat stateful text file that is nonetheless probably not best handled with a state machine is a Windows-style <TT>.ini</TT> file (generally replaced nowadays by use of the binary-data-with-API Windows registry). Those files consist of some section headers, some comments, and a number of value assignments. For example:</P>
<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="ch04list04"></A> File: hypothetical.ini</H5>

<PRE>
; set the colorscheme and userlevel
[colorscheme]
background=red
foreground=blue
title=green

[userlevel]
login=2
; admin=0
title=1
</PRE>
<P class="docText">This example has no real-life meaning, but it was constructed to indicate some features of the <TT>.ini</TT> format. (1) In one sense, the type of each line is determined by its first character (either semicolon, left brace, or alphabetic). (2) In another sense, the format is "stateful" insofar as the keyword "title" presumably means something independent when it occurs in each section. You could program a text processor that had a COLORSCHEME state and a USERLEVEL state, and processed the value assignments of each state. But that does not seem like the <span class="docEmphasis">right</span> way to handle this problem.</P>
<P class="docText">On the one hand, we could simply create the natural chunks in this text file with some Python code like:</P>
<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="ch04list05"></A> Chunking Python code to process .ini file</H5>

<PRE>
txt = open('hypothetical.ini').read()
from string import strip, split
nocomm = lambda s: s[0] != ';'        # "no comment" util
eq2pair = lambda s: split(s,'=')      # assignmet -&gt; pair
def assignments(sect):
    name, body = split(sect,']')      # identify name, body
    assigns = split(body,'\n')        # find assign lines
    assigns = filter(strip, assigns)  # remove outside space
    assigns = filter(None, assigns)   # remove empty lines
    assigns = filter(nocomm, assigns) # remove comment lines
    assigns = map(eq2pair, assigns)   # make name/val pairs
    assigns = map(tuple, assigns)     # prefer tuple pairs
    return (name, assigns)
sects = split(txt,'[')                # divide named sects
sects = map(strip, sects)             # remove outside newlines
sects = filter(nocomm, sects)         # remove comment sects
config = map(assignments, sects)      # find assigns by sect
pprint.pprint(config)
</PRE>
<P class="docText">Applied to the <TT>hypothetical.ini</TT> file above, this code produces output similar to:</P>
<pre>
[('colorscheme',
  [('background', 'red'),
   ('foreground', 'blue'),
   ('title', 'green')]),
 ('userlevel',
  [('login', '2'),
   ('title', '1')])]
</pre>
<P class="docText">This particular list-oriented data structure may or may not be what you want, but it is simple enough to transform this into dictionary entries, instance attributes, or whatever is desired. Or slightly modified code could generate other data representations in the first place.</P>
<P class="docText">An alternative approach is to use a single <TT>current_section</TT> variable to keep track of relevant state and process lines accordingly:</P>
<pre>
for line in open('hypothetical.ini').readlines():
    if line[0] == '[':
        current_section = line[1:-2]
    elif line[0] == ';':
        pass    # ignore comments
    else:
        apply_value(current_section, line)
</pre>
<A NAME="ch04lev5sec1"></A><H5 class="docSection3Title"> Sidebar: A digression on functional programming</H5>
<P class="docText">Readers will have noticed that the <TT>.ini</TT> chunking code given in the example above has more of a functional programming (FP) style to it than does most Python code (in this book or elsewhere). I wrote the presented code this way for two reasons. The more superficial reason is just to emphasize the contrast with a state machine approach. Much of the special quality of FP lies in its eschewal of state (see the discussion of functional programming in <A class="docLink" HREF="0321112547_ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</A>); so the example is, in a sense, even farther from a state machine technique than would be a coding style that used a few nested loops in place of the <TT>map()</TT> and <TT>filter()</TT> calls.</P>
<P class="docText">The more substantial reason I adopted a functional programming style is because I feel that this type of problem is precisely the sort that can often be expressed more compactly and more <span class="docEmphasis">clearly</span> using FP constructs. Basically, our source text document expresses a data structure that is homogeneous at each level. Each section is similar to other sections; and within a section, each assignment is similar to others. A clear드nd stateless등ay to manipulate these sorts of implicit structures is applying an operation uniformly to each thing at a given level. In the example, we do a given set of operations to find the assignments contained within a section, so we might as well just <TT>map()</TT> that set of operations to the collection of (massaged, noncomment) sections. This approach is more terse than a bunch of nested <TT>for</TT> loops, while simultaneously (in my opinion) better expressing the underlying intention of the textual analysis.</P>
<P class="docText">Use of a functional programming style, however, can easily be taken too far. Deeply nested calls to <TT>map()</TT>, <TT>reduce()</TT>, and <TT>filter()</TT> can quickly become difficult to read, especially if whitespace and function/variable names are not chosen carefully. Inasmuch as it is possible to write "obfuscated Python" code (a popular competition for other languages), it is almost always done using FP constructs. Warnings in mind, it is possible to create an even terser and more functional variant of the <TT>.ini</TT> chunking code (that produces identical results). I believe that the following falls considerably short of obfuscated, but will still be somewhat more difficult to read for most programmers. On the plus side, it is half the length of the prior code and is entirely free of accidental side effects:</P>
<H5 class="docExampleTitle"><A NAME="ch04list06"></A> Strongly functional code to process .ini file</H5>

<PRE>
from string import strip, split
eq2tup = lambda s: tuple(split(s,'='))
splitnames = lambda s: split(s,']')
parts = lambda s, delim: map(strip, split(s, delim))
useful = lambda ss: filter(lambda s: s and s[0]!=';', ss)
config = map(lambda _:(_[0], map(eq2tup, useful(parts(_[1],'\n')))),
             map(splitnames, useful(parts(txt,'['))) )
pprint.pprint(config)
</PRE>
<P class="docText">In brief, this functional code says that a configuration consists of a list of pairs of (1) names plus (2) a list of key/value pairs. Using list comprehensions might make this expression clearer, but the example code is compatible back to Python 1.5 Moreover, the utility function names <TT>useful()</TT> and <TT>parts()</TT> go a long way towards keeping the example readable. Utility functions of this sort are, furthermore, potentially worth saving in a separate module for other use (which, in a sense, makes the relevant <TT>.ini</TT> chunking code even shorter).</P>
<P class="docText">A reader exercise is to consider how the higher-order functions proposed in <A class="docLink" HREF="0321112547_ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</A>'s section on functional programming could further improve the sort of "stateless" text processing presented in this subsection.</P>
<A NAME="ch04lev2sec9"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">4.2.4 When to Use a State Machine</H4>
<P class="docText">Now that we have established not to use a state machine if the text file is "too simple," we should look at a case where a state machine is worthwhile. The utility <TT>Txt2Html </TT>is listed in <A class="docLink" HREF="0321112547_app04.html#app04">Appendix D</A>. <TT>Txt2Html</TT> converts "smart ASCII" files to HTML.</P>
<P class="docText">In very brief recap, smart ASCII format is a text format that uses a few spacing conventions to distinguish different types of text blocks, such as headers, regular text, quotations, and code samples. While it is easy for a human reader or writer to visually parse the transitions between these text block types, there is no simple way to chunk a whole text file into its text blocks. Unlike in the <TT>.ini</TT> file example, text block types can occur in any pattern of alternation. There is no single delimiter that separates blocks in all cases (a blank line <span class="docEmphasis">usually</span> separates blocks, but a blank line within a code sample does not necessarily end the code sample, and blocks need not be separated by blank lines). But we do need to perform somewhat different formatting behavior on each text block type for the correct final XML output. A state machine suggests itself as a natural solution here.</P>
<P class="docText">The general behavior of the <TT>Txt2Html</TT> reader is as follows: (1) Start in a particular state. (2) Read a line of the text file and go to current state context. (3) Decide if conditions have been met to leave the current state and enter another. (4) Failing (3), process the line in a manner appropriate for the current state. This example is about the simplest case you would encounter, but it expresses the pattern described:</P>

        elif textln.match(line):  startText(line)

    elif textln.match(line):  startText(line)
    else: blocks[-1] += line
else:
    raise ValueError, "unexpected input block state: "+state
</PRE>
<P class="docText">The only real thing to notice is that the variable <TT>state</TT> is declared <TT>global</TT>, and its value is changed in functions like <TT>startText()</TT>. The transition conditions듭uch as <TT>textln.match()</TT>드re regular expression patterns, but they could just as well be custom functions. The formatting itself is actually done later in the program; the state machine just parses the text file into labeled blocks in the <TT>blocks</TT> list. In a sense, the state machine here is acting as a tokenizer for the later block processor.</P>
<A NAME="ch04lev2sec10"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title">4.2.5 An Abstract State Machine Class</H4>
<P class="docText">It is easy in Python to abstract the form of a state machine. Coding in this manner makes the state machine model of the program stand out more clearly than does the simple conditional block in the previous example (which doesn't right away look all that much different from any other conditional). Furthermore, the class presented드nd the associated handlers듟oes a very good job of isolating in-state behavior. This improves both encapsulation and readability in many cases.</P>

</PRE>
<P class="docText">The <TT>StateMachine</TT> class is really all you need for the form of a state machine. It is a whole lot fewer lines than something similar would require in most languages듨ostly because of the ease of passing function objects in Python. You could even save a few lines by removing the target state check and the <TT>self.handlers</TT> list, but the extra formality helps enforce and document programmer intention.</P>
<P class="docText">To actually <span class="docEmphasis">use</span> the <TT>StateMachine</TT> class, you need to create some handlers for each state you want to use. A handler must follow a particular pattern. Generally, it should loop indefinitely; but in any case it must have some breakout condition(s). Each pass through the state handler's loop should process another event of the state's type. But probably even before handling events, the handler should check for breakout conditions and determine what state is appropriate to transition to. At the end, a handler should pass back a tuple consisting of the target state's name and any cargo the new state handler will need.</P>
<P class="docText">An encapsulation device is the use of <TT>cargo</TT> as a variable in the <TT>StateMachine</TT> class (not necessarily called <TT>cargo</TT> by the handlers). This is used to pass around "whatever is needed" by one state handler to take over where the last state handler left off. Most typically, <TT>cargo</TT> will consist of a file handle, which would allow the next handler to read some more data after the point where the last state handler stopped. But a database connection might get passed, or a complex class instance, or a tuple with several things in it.</P>

<P class="docText">The code to processes this report below is a bit simplistic. Within each state, almost all the code is devoted merely to deciding when to leave the state and where to go next. In the sample, each of the "buyer states" is sufficiently similar that they could well be generalized to one parameterized state; but in a real-world application, each state is likely to contain much more detailed custom programming for both in-state behavior and out-from-state transition conditions. For example, a report might allow different formatting and fields within different buyer blocks.</P>

<P class="docText">The body of each state function consists mostly of a <TT>while 1:</TT> loop that sometimes breaks out by returning a new target state, along with a cargo tuple.

<P class="docText">In place of reading in such a data structure, a full application might calculate some values or read them from a database of some sort. Nonetheless, the division of data, state logic, and abstract flow into separate modules makes for a good design.</P>

<P class="docText">Another benefit of the state machine design approach is that you can use different start and end states without touching the state handlers at all. Obviously, you do not have complete freedom in doing so들f a state branches to another state, the branch target needs to be included in the list of "registered" states. You can, however, add homonymic handlers in place of target processing states. For example:</P>

<P class="docText">In a complex state machine graph, you often encounter relatively isolated subgraphs. That is, a particular collection of states들.e., nodes듨ight have many connections between them, but only a few connections out to the rest of the graph. Usually this occurs because a subgraph concerns a related set of functionality.</P>
<P class="docText">For processing the buyer report discussed earlier, only seven states were involved, so no meaningful subgraphs really exist. But in the subgraph example above, you can imagine that the <span class="docEmphasis">BigGraph</span> module contains hundreds or thousands of state handlers, whose targets define a very complex complete graph. Supposing that the states <TT>spam</TT>, <TT>eggs</TT>, and <TT>bacon</TT> define a useful subgraph, and all branches out of the subgraph lead to <TT>foo</TT>, <TT>bar</TT>, or <TT>baz</TT>, the code above could be an entire new application.</P>
<P class="docText">The example redefined <TT>foo</TT> and <TT>bar</TT> as end states, so processing (at least in that particular <TT>StateMachine</TT> object) ends when they are reached. However, <TT>baz</TT> is redefined to transition back into the spam-eggs-bacon subgraph. A subgraph exit need not represent a termination of the state machine. It is actually the <TT>end_state</TT> flag that controls termination득ut if <TT>foo</TT> was not marked as an end state, it would raise a <TT>RuntimeError</TT> when it failed to return a valid state target.</P>
<P class="docText">If you create large graphs든specially with the intention of utilizing subgraphs as state machines들t is often useful to create a state diagram. Pencil and paper are perfectly adequate tools for doing this; a variety of flow-chart software also exists to do it on a computer. The goal of a diagram is to allow you to identify clustered subgraphs and most especially to help identify paths in and out of a functional subgraph. A state diagram from our buyer report example is given as illustration. A quick look at <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch04fig01">Figure 4.1</A>, for example, allows the discovery that the <TT>error</TT> end state is isolated, which might not have been evident in the code itself. This is not a problem, necessarily; a future enhancement to the diagram and handlers might utilize this state, and whatever logic was written into it.</P>
