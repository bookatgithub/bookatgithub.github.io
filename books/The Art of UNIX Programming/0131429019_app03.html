<p class="docText">Anyone who has attended a USENIX conference in a fancy hotel can tell you that a sentence like "You're one of those computer people, aren't you?" is roughly equivalent to "Look, another amazingly mobile form of slime mold!" in the mouth of a hotel cocktail waitress.</p>
<p class="docText">—Elizabeth Zwicky</p></blockquote><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Ken Arnold</span> was part of the group that created the 4BSD Unix releases. He wrote the original <span class="docEmphasis">curses</span>(3) library and was one of the authors of the original <span class="docEmphasis">rogue</span>(6) game. He is a co-author of the <span class="docEmphasis">Java Reference Manual</span>, and one of the leading experts on Java and OO techniques.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Steven M. Bellovin</span> created Usenet<A NAME="idd1e46794"></A> (with Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis) while at University of North Carolina in 1979. In 1982 he joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, where he has done pioneering research in security, cryptography, and networking on Unix systems and elsewhere. He is an active member of the Internet Engineering Task Force, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Stuart Feldman</span> was a member of the Bell Labs Unix development group. He wrote <span class="docEmphasis">make</span>(1) and <span class="docEmphasis">f77</span>(1). He is now the vice-president in charge of computing research at IBM<A NAME="idd1e46809"></A>.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Jim Gettys</span> was, with Bob Scheifler and Keith Packard, one of the principal architects of the X windowing system in the late 1980s. He wrote much of the X library, the X license, and articulated the "mechanism, not policy" central credo of the X design.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Steve Johnson</span> wrote <span class="docEmphasis">yacc</span>(1) and then used it to write the Portable C Compiler, which replaced the original DMR C and became the ancestor of most later Unix C compilers.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Brian Kernighan</span> has been the Unix community's single most articulate exponent of good style. He has authored or coauthored several books that are indispensable classics of the tradition, including <span class="docEmphasis">The Practice of Programming</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">The C Programming Language</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">The Unix Programming Environment</span>. While at Bell Labs, he coauthored the <span class="docEmphasis">awk</span>(1) language and had a major hand in the development of the troff family of tools, including <span class="docEmphasis">eqn</span>(1) (co-written with Lorinda Cherry), <span class="docEmphasis">pic</span>(1), and <span class="docEmphasis">grap</span>(1) (Jon Bentley).</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">David Korn</span><A NAME="idd1e46856"></A> wrote the Korn shell<A NAME="idd1e46860"></A>, the stylistic ancestor of almost all modern Unix shell designs. He created UWIN, a UNIX emulator for those that are forced to use Windows. David has also done research in the design of file systems and tools for source-code portability.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Mike Lesk</span> was part of the original Unix crew at Bell Labs. Among other contributions, he wrote the <TT>ms</TT> macro package, the <span class="docEmphasis">tbl</span>(1) and <span class="docEmphasis">refer</span>(1) tools for word processing, the <span class="docEmphasis">lex</span>(1) lexical-analyzer generator, and <TT>UUCP</TT> (Unix-to-Unix copy program).</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Doug McIlroy</span> headed the research group at Bell Labs where Unix was born and invented the Unix pipe. He wrote <span class="docEmphasis">spell</span>(1), <span class="docEmphasis">diff</span>(1), <span class="docEmphasis">sort</span>(1), <span class="docEmphasis">join</span>(1), <span class="docEmphasis">tr</span>(1), and other classic Unix tools, and helped define the traditional style of Unix documentation. He has also done pioneering work in storage-allocation algorithms, computer security, and theorem-proving.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Marshall Kirk McKusick</span> implemented the 4.2BSD fast file system and was the Research Computer Scientist at the Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) overseeing the development and release of 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Keith Packard</span> was a major contributor to the original X11 code. During a second phase of involvement beginning in 1999, Keith rewrote the X rendering code, producing a more powerful but dramatically smaller implementation suitable for handheld computers and PDAs.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Eric S. Raymond</span> has been writing Unix software since 1982. In 1991 he edited <span class="docEmphasis">The New Hacker's Dictionary</span>, and has since been studying the Unix community and the Internet hacker culture from a historical and anthropological perspective. In 1997 that study produced <span class="docEmphasis">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</span>, that helped (re)define and energize the open-source movement. He presently maintains more than thirty open-source software projects and about a dozen key FAQ documents.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Henry Spencer</span> was a leader among the first wave of programmers to embrace Unix when it escaped from Bell Labs in the mid-1970s. His contributions included the public-domain <span class="docEmphasis">getopt</span>(3), the first open-source string library, and an open-source regular-expression engine which found use in 4.4BSD and as the reference for the POSIX standard. He is also a noted expert on the arcana of C. He was a coauthor of C News, and has for many years been a voice of reason on Usenet<A NAME="idd1e46936"></A> and one of its most respected regulars.</P><P class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Ken Thompson</span> invented Unix.<A NAME="idd1e46945"></A><A NAME="idd1e46950"></A><A NAME="idd1e46955"></A><A NAME="idd1e46960"></A><A NAME="idd1e46965"></A><A NAME="idd1e46972"></A><A NAME="idd1e46977"></A><A NAME="idd1e46982"></A><A NAME="idd1e46987"></A></P>
