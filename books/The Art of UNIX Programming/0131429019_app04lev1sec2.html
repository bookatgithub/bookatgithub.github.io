<H3 class="docSection1Title" id="162666-879"> Master Foo and the Ten Thousand Lines</H3>
<P class="docText">Master Foo once said to a visiting programmer: "There is more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C".</P>
<P class="docText">The programmer, who was very proud of his mastery of C, said: "How can this be? C is the language in which the very kernel of Unix is implemented!"</P>
<P class="docText">Master Foo replied: "That is so. Nevertheless, there is more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C".</P>
<P class="docText">The programmer grew distressed. "But through the C language we experience the enlightenment of the Patriarch Ritchie! We become as one with the operating system and the machine, reaping matchless performance!"</P>
<P class="docText">Master Foo replied: "All that you say is true. But there is still more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C".</P>
<P class="docText">The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart. But Master Foo nodded to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell script on a nearby whiteboard, and said: "Master programmer, consider this pipeline. Implemented in pure C, would it not span ten thousand lines?"</P>
<P class="docText">The programmer muttered through his beard, contemplating what Nubi had written. Finally he agreed that it was so.</P>
<P class="docText">"And how many hours would you require to implement and debug that C program?" asked Nubi.</P>
<P class="docText">"Many", admitted the visiting programmer. "But only a fool would spend the time to do that when so many more worthy tasks await him".</P>
<P class="docText">"And who better understands the Unix-nature?" Master Foo asked. "Is it he who writes the ten thousand lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task, gains merit by not coding?"</P>
<P class="docText">Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.</P>
