<H3 class="docSection1Title"> Master Foo and the Script Kiddie</H3>
<P class="docText">A stranger from the land of Woot came to Master Foo as he was eating the morning meal with his students.</P>
<P class="docText">"I hear y00 are very l33t", he said. "Pl33z teach m3 all y00 know".</P>
<P class="docText">Master Foo's students looked at each other, confused by the stranger's barbarous language. Master Foo just smiled and replied: "You wish to learn the Way of Unix?"</P>
<P class="docText">"I want to b3 a wizard hax0r", the stranger replied, "and 0wn ever3one's b0xen".</P>
<P class="docText">"I do not teach that Way", replied Master Foo.</P>
<P class="docText">The stranger grew agitated. "D00d, y00 r nothing but a p0ser", he said. "If y00 n00 anything, y00 wud t33ch m3".</P>
<P class="docText">"There is a path", said Master Foo, "that might bring you to wisdom". The master scribbled an IP address on a piece of paper. "Cracking this box should pose you little difficulty, as its guardians are incompetent. Return and tell me what you find".</P>
<P class="docText">The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.</P>
<P class="docText">Days passed, then months. The stranger was forgotten.</P>
<P class="docText">Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.</P>
<P class="docText">"Damn you!" he said, "I cracked that box, and it was easy like you said. But I got busted by the FBI and thrown in jail".</P>
<P class="docText">"Good", said Master Foo. "You are ready for the next lesson". He scribbled an IP address on another piece of paper and handed it to the stranger.</P>
<P class="docText">"Are you <span class="docEmphasis">crazy</span>?" the stranger yelled. "After what I've been through, I'm never going to break into a computer again!"</P>
<P class="docText">Master Foo smiled. "Here", he said, "is the beginning of wisdom".</P>
<P class="docText">On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.</P>
