<H3 class="docSection1Title"> Master Foo and the End User</H3>
<P class="docText">On another occasion when Master Foo gave public instruction, an end user, having heard tales of the Master's wisdom, came to him for guidance.</P>
<P class="docText">He bowed three times to Master Foo. "I wish to learn the Great Way of Unix", he said "but the command line confuses me".</P>
<P class="docText">Some of the onlooking neophytes began to mock the end user, calling him "clueless" and saying that the Way of Unix is only for those of discipline and intelligence.</P>
<P class="docText">The Master held up a hand for silence, and called the most obstreperous of the neophytes who had mocked forward, to where he and the end user sat.</P>
<P class="docText">"Tell me", he asked the neophyte, "of the code you have written and the works of design you have uttered".</P>
<P class="docText">The neophyte began to stammer out a reply, but fell silent.</P>
<P class="docText">Master Foo turned to the end-user. "Tell me", he inquired, "why do you seek the Way?"</P>
<P class="docText">"I am discontent with the software I see around me", the end user replied. "It neither performs reliably nor pleases the eye and hand. Having heard that the Unix way, though difficult, is superior, I seek to cast aside all snares and delusions".</P>
<P class="docText">"And what do you do in the world", asked Master Foo, "that you must strive with software?"</P>
<P class="docText">"I am a builder", the end user replied, "Many of the houses of this town were made under my chop".</P>
<P class="docText">Master Foo turned back to the neophyte. "The housecat may mock the tiger", said the master, "but doing so will not make his purr into a roar".</P>
<P class="docText">Upon hearing this, the neophyte was enlightened.</P>
