<H3 class="docSection1Title">3.3 What Goes Around, Comes Around</H3>
<P class="docText">We attempted to select for comparison timesharing systems that either are now or have in the past been competitive with Unix. The field of plausible candidates is not wide. Most (Multics<A NAME="idd1e9470"></A>, ITS<A NAME="idd1e9474"></A>, DTSS<A NAME="idd1e9478"></A>, TOPS-10<A NAME="idd1e9482"></A>, TOPS-20<A NAME="idd1e9486"></A><A NAME="idd1e9489"></A>, MTS<A NAME="idd1e9493"></A>, GCOS<A NAME="idd1e9497"></A>, MPE<A NAME="idd1e9501"></A> and perhaps a dozen others) are so long dead that they are fading from the collective memory of the computing field. Of those we surveyed, VMS and OS/2 are moribund, and MacOS has been subsumed by a Unix derivative. MVS and VM/CMS were limited to a single proprietary mainframe line. Only Microsoft Windows<A NAME="idd1e9508"></A><A NAME="idd1e9511"></A> remains as a viable competitor independent of the Unix tradition.</P>
<P class="docText">We pointed out Unix's strengths in <A class="docLink" HREF="0131429019_ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</A>, and they are certainly part of the explanation. But it's actually more instructive to look at the obverse of that answer and ask which weaknesses in Unix's competitors did them in.</P>
<P class="docText">The most obvious shared problem is nonportability. Most of Unix's pre-1980 competitors were tied to a single hardware platform, and died with that platform. One reason VMS survived long enough to merit inclusion here as a case study is that it was successfully ported from its original VAX hardware to the Alpha processor (and in 2003 is being ported from Alpha to Itanium). MacOS successfully made the jump from the Motorola 68000 to PowerPC chips in the late 1980s. Microsoft Windows<A NAME="idd1e9527"></A> escaped this problem by being in the right place when commoditization flattened the market for general-purpose computers into a PC monoculture.</P>
<P class="docText">From 1980 on, another particular weakness continually reemerges as a theme in different systems that Unix either steamrollered or outlasted: an inability to support networking gracefully.</P>
<P class="docText">In a world of pervasive networking, even an operating system designed for single-user use needs multiuser capability (multiple privilege groups)—because without that, any network transaction that can trick a user into running malicious code will subvert the entire system (Windows macro viruses<A NAME="idd1e9537"></A> are only the tip of this iceberg). Without strong multitasking, the ability of an operating system to handle network traffic and run user programs at the same time will be impaired. The operating system also needs efficient IPC so that its network programs can communicate with each other and with the user's foreground applications.</P>
<P class="docText">Windows gets away with having severe deficiencies in these areas only by virtue of having developed a monopoly position before networking became really important, and by having a user population that has been conditioned to accept a shocking frequency of crashes and security breaches as normal. This is not a stable situation, and it is one that partisans of Linux have successfully (in 2003) exploited to make major inroads in the server-operating-system market.</P>
<P class="docText">Around 1980, during the early heyday of personal computers, operating-system designers dismissed Unix and traditional timesharing as heavyweight, cumbersome, and inappropriate for the brave new world of single-user personal machines—despite the fact that GUI interfaces tended to demand the reinvention of multitasking to cope with threads of execution bound to different windows and widgets. The trend toward client operating systems was so intense that server operating systems were at times dismissed as steam-powered relics of a bygone age.</P>
<P class="docText">But as the designers of BeOS<A NAME="idd1e9555"></A> noticed, the requirements of pervasive networking cannot be met without implementing something very close to general-purpose timesharing. Single-user client operating systems cannot thrive in an Internetted world.</P>
<P class="docText">This problem drove the reconvergence of client and server operating systems. The first, pre-Internet attempts at peer-to-peer networking over LANs, in the late 1980s, began to expose the inadequacy of the client-OS design model. Data on a network has to have rendezvous points in order to be shared; thus, we can't do without servers. At the same time, experience with the Macintosh and Windows client operating systems raised the bar on the minimum quality of user experience customers would tolerate.</P>
<P class="docText">With non-Unix models for timesharing effectively dead by 1990, there were not many possible responses client operating-system designers could mount to this challenge. They could co-opt Unix (as MacOS X has done), re-invent roughly equivalent features a patch at a time (as Windows<A NAME="idd1e9565"></A><A NAME="idd1e9568"></A> has done), or attempt to reinvent the entire world (as BeOS tried and failed to do). But meanwhile, open-source<A NAME="idd1e9574"></A> Unixes were growing client-like capabilities to use GUIs and run on inexpensive personal machines.</P>
<P class="docText">These pressures turned out, however, not to be as symmetrically balanced as the above description might imply. Retrofitting server-operating-system features like multiple privilege classes and full multitasking onto a client operating system is very difficult, quite likely to break compatibility with older versions of the client, and generally produces a fragile and unsatisfactory result rife with stability and security problems. Retrofitting a GUI<A NAME="idd1e9581"></A> onto a server operating system, on the other hand, raises problems that can largely be finessed by a combination of cleverness and throwing ever-more-inexpensive hardware resources at the problem. As with buildings, it's easier to repair superstructure on top of a solid foundation than it is to replace the foundations without trashing the superstructure.</P>
<P class="docText">Besides having the native architectural strengths of a server operating system, Unix was always agnostic about its intended audience. Its designers and implementers never assumed they knew all potential uses the system would be put to.</P>
<P class="docText">Thus, the Unix design proved more capable of reinventing itself as a client than any of its client-operating-system competitors were of reinventing themselves as servers. While many other factors of technology and economics contributed to the Unix resurgence of the 1990s, this is one that really foregrounds itself in any discussion of operating-system design style.</P>
