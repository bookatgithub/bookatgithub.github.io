<H3 class="docSection1Title">17.7 Portability, Open Standards, and Open Source</H3>
<P class="docText"><A NAME="idd1e38533"></A>Portability requires standards. Open-source reference implementations<A NAME="idd1e38539"></A> are the most effective method known for both promulgating a standard and for pressuring proprietary vendors into conforming. If you are a developer, open-source implementations of a published standard can both tremendously reduce your coding workload and allow your product to benefit (in ways both expected and unexpected) from the labor of others.</P>
<P class="docText">Let's suppose, for example, you are designing image-capture software for a digital camera. Why write your own format for saving image bits or buy proprietary code when (as we noted in <A class="docLink" HREF="0131429019_ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</A>) there is a well-tested, full-featured library for writing PNGs<A NAME="idd1e38553"></A> in open source?</P>
<P class="docText">The (re)invention of open source has had a significant impact on the standards process as well. Though it is not formally a requirement, the IETF<A NAME="idd1e38560"></A> has since around 1997 grown increasingly resistant to standard-tracking RFCs that do not have at least one open-source reference implementation. In the future, it seems likely that conformance to any given standard will increasingly be measured by conformance to (or outright use of!) open-source implementations that have been blessed by the standard's authors.</P>
<blockquote>

<p class="docText"><A NAME="idd1e38574"></A>The flip side of this is that often the best way to <span class="docEmphasis">make</span> something a standard is to distribute a high-quality open-source implementation of it.</p>
<p class="docText">—Henry Spencer</p></blockquote>
<P class="docText">In the end, the most effective step you can take to ensure the portability of your code is to not rely on proprietary technology. You never know when the closed-source library or tool or code generator or network protocol you are depending on will be end-of-lifed, or when the interface will be changed in some backwards-incompatible way that breaks your project. With open-source code<A NAME="idd1e38585"></A>, you have a path forward even if the leading-edge version changes in a way that breaks your project; because you have access to source code, you can forward-port it to new platforms if you need to.</P>
<P class="docText">Until the late 1990s this advice would have been impractical. The few alternatives to relying on proprietary operating systems and development tools were noble experiments, academic proofs-of-concept, or toys. But the Internet changed everything; in mid-2003 Linux<A NAME="idd1e38592"></A> and the other open-source Unixes exist and have proven their mettle as platforms for delivering production-quality software. Developers have a better option now than being dependent on short-term business decisions designed to protect someone else's monopoly. Practice defensive design—build on open source and don't get stranded!</P>
