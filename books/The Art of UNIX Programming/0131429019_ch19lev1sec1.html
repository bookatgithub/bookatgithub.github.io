<H3 class="docSection1Title">19.1 Unix and Open Source</H3>
<P class="docText"><A NAME="idd1e40236"></A>Open-source development exploits the fact that characterizing and fixing bugs—unlike, say, implementing a particular algorithm—is a task that lends itself well to being split into multiple parallel subtasks. Exploration of the neighborhood of possibilities near a prototype design also parallelizes well. With the right technological and social machinery in place, development teams that are loosely networked and very large can do astoundingly good work.</P>
<P class="docText">Astoundingly, that is, if you are carrying around the mental habits developed by people who treat process secrecy and proprietary control as a given. From <span class="docEmphasis">The Mythical Man-Month</span> <A class="docLink" HREF="0131429019_app02.html#biblio08">[Brooks]</A> until the rise of Linux<A NAME="idd1e40251"></A>, the orthodoxy in software engineering was all about small, closely managed teams within heavyweight organizations like corporations and government. The practice was of <span class="docEmphasis">large</span> teams closely managed.</P>
<P class="docText">The early Unix community, before the AT&amp;T<A NAME="idd1e40261"></A> divestiture, was a paradigmatic example of open source in action. While the predivestiture Unix code was technically and legally proprietary, it was treated as a common within its user/developer community. Volunteer efforts were self-directed by the people most strongly motivated to solve problems. From these choices many good things flowed. Indeed, the technique of open-source development evolved as an unconscious folk practice in the Unix community for more than a quarter century, many years before it was analyzed and labeled in the late 1990s (See <span class="docEmphasis">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</span> <A class="docLink" HREF="0131429019_app02.html#biblio67">[Raymond01]</A> and <span class="docEmphasis">Understanding Open Source Software Development</span> [Feller-Fitzgerald].</P>
<P class="docText">In retrospect, it is rather startling how oblivious we all were to the implications of our own behavior. Several people came very close to understanding the phenomenon; Richard Gabriel in his "Worse Is Better"<A NAME="idd1e40279"></A><A NAME="idd1e40282"></A> paper from 1990 <A class="docLink" HREF="0131429019_app02.html#biblio25">[Gabriel]</A> is the best known, but one can find prefigurations in Brooks <A class="docLink" HREF="0131429019_app02.html#biblio08">[Brooks]</A> (1975) and as far back as Vyssotsky and Corbat&oacute;'s meditations on the Multics<A NAME="idd1e40292"></A> design (1965). I failed to get it over more than twenty years of observing software development, before being awakened by Linux in the mid-1990s. This experience should make any thoughtful and humble person wonder what other important unifying concepts are still implicit in our behavior and lurking right under our collective noses, hidden not by their complexity but by their very simplicity.</P>
<P class="docText">The rules of open-source development are simple:</P>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Let the source be open.</span> Have no secrets. Make the code and the process that produces it public. Encourage third-party peer review. Make sure that others can modify and redistribute the code freely. Grow the co-developer community as big as you can.</p></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Release early, release often.</span> A rapid release tempo means quick and effective feedback. When each incremental release is small, changing course in response to real-world feedback is easier.</p><P class="docList">Just make sure your first release builds, runs, and demonstrates promise. Usually, an initial version of an open-source program demonstrates promise by doing at least some portion of its final job, sufficient to show that the initiator can actually continue the project. For example, an initial version of a word processor might support typing in text and displaying it on the screen.</P><P class="docList">A first release that cannot be compiled or run can kill a project (as, famously, almost happened to the Mozilla browser). Releases that cannot compile suggest that the project developers will be unable to complete the project, Also, non-working programs are difficult for other developers to contribute to, because they cannot easily determine if any change they made improved the program or not.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Reward contribution with praise.</span> If you can't give your co-developers material rewards, give psychological ones. Even if you can, remember that people will often work harder for reputation than they would for gold.</p></span></LI></OL></span>
<blockquote>

<p class="docText"><A NAME="idd1e40339"></A>A corollary of rule 2 is that individual releases should not be momentous events, with many promises attached and much preparation. It's important to ruthlessly streamline your release process, so that you <span class="docEmphasis">can</span> do frequent releases painlessly. A setup where all other work must stop during release preparation is a terrible mistake. (Notably, if you're using CVS or something similar, releases in preparation should be branches off the main line of development, so that they don't block main-line progress.) To sum up, don't treat releases as big special events; make them part of normal routine.</p>
<p class="docText">—Henry Spencer</p></blockquote>
<P class="docText">Remember that the reason for frequent releases is to shorten and speed the feedback loop connecting your user population to your developers. Therefore, resist thinking of the next release as a polished jewel that cannot ship until everything is perfect. Don't make long wish lists. Make progress incrementally, admit and advertise current bugs, and have confidence that perfection will come with time. Accept that you will go through dozens of point releases on the way, and don't get upset as the version numbers mount.</P>
<P class="docText">Open-source development uses large teams of programmers distributed over the Internet and communicating primarily through email and Web documents. Typically, most contributors to any given project are volunteers contributing in order to be rewarded by the increased usefulness of the software to them, and by reputation incentives. A central individual or core group steers the project; other contributors may drop in and drop out sporadically. To encourage casual contributors, it is important to avoid erecting social barriers between them and the core team. Minimize the core team's privileged status, and work hard to keep the boundaries inconspicuous.</P>
<P class="docText">Open-source projects follow the Unix-tradition advice of automating wherever possible. They use the <span class="docEmphasis">patch</span>(1) tool to pass around incremental changes. Many projects (and all large ones) have network-accessible code repositories using version-control systems like CVS (recall the discussion in <A class="docLink" HREF="0131429019_ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</A>). Use of automated bug- and patch-tracking systems is also common.</P>
<P class="docText">In 1997, almost nobody outside the hacker culture<A NAME="idd1e40372"></A> understood that it was even possible to run a large project this way, let alone get high-quality results. In 2003 this is no longer news; projects like Linux<A NAME="idd1e40376"></A>, Apache<A NAME="idd1e40382"></A>, and Mozilla<A NAME="idd1e40386"></A> have achieved both success and high public visibility.</P>
<P class="docText">Abandoning the habit of secrecy in favor of process transparency<A NAME="idd1e40393"></A> and peer review was the crucial step by which alchemy became chemistry. In the same way, it is beginning to appear that open-source development may signal the long-awaited maturation of software development as a discipline.</P>
