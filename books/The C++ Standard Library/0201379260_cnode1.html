<FONT size="-1"><H2>Preface</H2><P>In the beginning, I only planned to write a small German book (400 pages or so) about the C++ standard library. That was in 1993. Now, in 1999 you see the result — an English book with more than 800 pages of facts, figures, and examples. My goal is to describe the C++ standard library so that all (or almost all) your programming questions are answered before you think of the question. Note, however, that this is not a complete description of all aspects of the C++ standard library. Instead, I present the most important topics necessary for learning and programming in C++ by using its standard library.</P>
<p>Each topic is described based on the general concepts; this discussion then leads to the specific details needed to support every-day programming tasks. Specific code examples are provided to help you understand the concepts and the details.</p>
<p>That's it — in a nutshell. I hope you get as much pleasure from reading this book as I did from writing it. Enjoy!</p>
