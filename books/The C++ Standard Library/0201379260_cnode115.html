<FONT><h2>Chapter
14. Internationalization</h2>
				<p>As the global market has increased in importance, so has <i>internationalization</I> (or <I>i18n</I> for short)<Font sIZE="1"><Sup><a hREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></sup></font>
 become more important for software development. As a consequence, the C++ standard library provides concepts to write code for international programs. These concepts influence mainly the use of I/O and string processing. This chapter describes these concepts. Many thanks to <b>Dietmar Kühl,</b> who is an expert on I/O and internationalization in the C++ standard library and wrote major parts of this chapter.</p>

<I>i18n</I> is a common abbreviation for <i>internationalization.</i> It stands for <i>the letter i, followed by 18 characters, followed by the letter n.</i></P>
</FONt></bloCKQUote>

				<p>The C++ standard library provides a general approach to support national conventions without being bound to specific conventions. This goes to the extent, for example, that strings are not bound to a specific character type to support 16-bit characters in Asia. For the internationalization of programs, two related aspects are important:</p>

				<ol type="1" start="restarts">
<li><p>Different character sets have different properties. Handling them requires flexible solutions for problems, such as what is considered to be a letter or, worse, what type to use to represent characters. For character sets with more than 256 characters, type <tt CLASS="monofont">char</Tt> is not sufficient as a representation.</P>
</Li>
<LI><P>The user of a program expects to see national or cultural conventions obeyed (for example, the formatting of dates, monetary values, numbers, and Boolean values).</p>

					</lI>
</OL>

				<P>For both aspects, the C++ standard library provides related solutions.</p>

				<p>The major approach toward internationalization is to use <i>locale objects</i> to represent an extensible collection of aspects to be adapted to specific local conventions. Locales are already used in C to adapt to specific local conventions. In the C++ standard, this mechanism was generalized and made more flexible. Actually, the C++ locale mechanism can be used to address all kinds of customization, depending on the user's environment or preferences. For example, it can be extended to deal with measurement systems, time zones, or paper size.</P>

				<P>Most of the mechanisms of internationalization involve no or only minimal additional work for the programmer. For example, when doing I/O with the C++ stream mechanism, numeric values are formatted according to the rules of some locale. The only work for the programmer is to instruct the I/O stream classes to use the user's preferences.</P>

				<P>In addition to such automatic use, the programmer may use locale objects directly for formatting, collation, character classification, and so on. Some internationalized aspects supported by the C++ standard library are not used by the C++ standard library itself, and to use them the programmer has to call those functions manually. For example, there are no stream functions defined in the C++ standard library that do time, date, or monetary formatting. To use these services, it is necessary to call them directly (for example, in user-defined stream operators writing objects of a money class).</p>

				<p>Strings and streams use another concept for internationalization: <i>character traits.</i> They define fundamental properties and operations that differ for different character sets, such as the value of "end-of-file" as well as functions to compare, assign, and copy strings.</P>

				<P>The classes for internationalization were introduced to the standard relatively late. Although the general approach is extremely flexible, it still needs some work to make it really complete. For example, the functions for string collation (that is, comparing strings for sorting according to some locale conventions) use only iterators of type <TT clasS="monofont">const charT*,</TT> where <Tt class="monofont">charT</tt> is some character type. Although it is very likely that <tt class="monofont">basic_string&lt;charT&gt;</tt> uses this type as an iterator type, it is not at all guaranteed. Thus, it is not guaranteed that string iterators can be used as arguments to the functions for string collation. However, it is possible to use the result of <tt clASS="monofont">basic_string data()</TT> member functions with the string collation functions.</P>
