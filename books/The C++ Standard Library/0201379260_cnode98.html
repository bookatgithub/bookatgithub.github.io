<FONT><h2>Chapter
13. Input/Output Using Stream Classes</h2>
				<p>The classes for I/O form an important part of the C++ standard library; a program without I/O is not of much use. Actually, the I/O classes from the C++ standard library are not restricted to files or to screen and keyboard. Instead, they form an extensible framework for the formatting of arbitrary data and access to arbitrary "external representations."</p>

				<P>The <I>IOStream library,</I> as the classes for I/O are called, is the only part of the C++ standard library that was used widely prior to the standardization of C++. Early distributions of C++ systems came with a set of classes developed at AT&amp;T that established a de facto standard for doing I/O. Although these classes have undergone several changes to fit consistently into the C++ standard library and to suit new needs, the basic principles of the IOStream library remain unchanged.</P>

				<p>This chapter first presents a general overview of the most important components and techniques, and then demonstrates in detail how the IOStream library can be used in practice. Its use ranges from simple formatting to the integration of new external representations (a topic that is often addressed improperly).</p>

				<p>This chapter does not attempt to discuss all aspects of the IOStream library in detail; to do that would take an entire book by itself. For details not found here, please consult one of the books that focus on the I/O stream library or the reference manual of the C++ standard library.</p>

				<P>Many thanks to Dietmar Kühl, who is an expert on I/O and internationalization in the C++ standard library and gave very much feedback and wrote some parts of this chapter.</P>
