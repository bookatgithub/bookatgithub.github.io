<FONT><h3>13.3
Standard Stream Operators &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;</h3>
			<p>In C and C++, operators <tT CLAss="monofont">&lt;&lt;</tt> and <TT CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;</tT> are used for shifting bits of an integer to the right or the left respectively. The classes <TT Class="monofont">basic_istream&lt;&gt;</tt> and <tt class="monofont">basic_ostream&lt;&gt;</tt> overload operators <tt clasS="monofont">&gt;&gt;</TT> and <TT ClASs="monofont">&lt;&lt;</TT> as the standard I/O operators. Thus, in C++ the "shift operators" became the "I/O operators."<fONT SIZe="1"><sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></suP></FONt>

			<h4>13.3.1
Output Operator &lt;&lt;</h4>
				<p>The class <TT CLass="monofont">basic_ostream</tT> (and thus also the classes <TT Class="monofont">ostream</tt> and <tt class="monofont">wstream</tt>) defines <tt clasS="monofont">&lt;&lt;</TT> as an output operator. It overloads this operator for all fundamental types, including <TT ClASs="monofont">char*, void*,</TT> and <tT CLASS="monofont">bool.</tt></p>

				<p>The output operators for streams are defined to send their second argument to the corresponding stream. Thus, the data is sent in the direction of the arrow:</P>

				<PRE>
					
    int i = 7;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i;                  <i>// outputs:</i> 7

    float f = 4.5;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; f;                  <i>// outputs:</i> 4.5

				</PRE>

				<P>The <tt clASS="monofont">&lt;&lt;</Tt> operator can be overloaded such that the second argument is an arbitrary data type. This allows the integration of your own data types into the I/O system. The compiler ensures that the correct function for outputting the second argument is called. Of course, this function should in fact transform the second argument into a sequence of characters sent to the stream.</p>

				<p>The C++ standard library also uses this mechanism to provide output operators for strings (see page 524), bitsets (see page 468), and complex numbers (see page 539):</p>

				<pre>
					
   std::string s("hello");
   s += ", world";
   std::cout &lt;&lt; s;                  <i>// outputs:</i> hello, world

   std::bitset&lt;10&gt; flags(7);
   std::cout &lt;&lt; flags;              <i>// outputs:</i> 0000000111

   std::complex&lt;float&gt; c(3.1,7.4);
   std::cout &lt;&lt; c;                  <i>// outputs:</i> (3.1,7.4)

				</pre>

				<p>The details about writing output operators for your own data types are explained in <a href="0201379260_snode112.html">Section 13.12</A>.</P>

				<P>The fact that the output mechanism can be extended to incorporate your own data types is a significant improvement over C's I/O mechanism that uses <TT cLAsS="monofont">printf():</Tt> It is not necessary to specify the type of an object to be printed. Instead, the overloading of different types ensures that the correct function for printing is deduced automatically. The mechanism is not limited to standard types. Thus, the user has only one mechanism that works for all types.</P>

				<P>Operator <TT CLass="monofont">&lt;&lt;</tT> can also be used to print multiple objects in one statement. By convention, the output operators return their first argument. Thus, the result of an output operator is the output stream. This allows you to chain calls to output operators like this:</P>

				<PRe>
					
   std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " times " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; " is " &lt;&lt; x * y &lt;&lt; std::endl;

				</pre>

				<P>Operator <TT Class="monofont">&lt;&lt;</TT> is evaluated from left to right. Thus.</P>

				<Pre>
					
   std::cout &lt;&lt; x

				</pre>

				<p>is executed first. Note that the evaluative order of the operator does not imply any specific order in which the arguments are evaluated; only the order in which the operators are executed is defined. This expression returns its first operand<tt class="monofont">— std::cout.</tt> So,</p>

				<pre>
					
   std::cout &lt;&lt; " times "

				</prE>

				<P>is executed next. The object <TT CLaSS="monofont">y,</tT> the string literal <Tt CLASS="monofont">" is ",</Tt> and the result of <tt cLASS="monofont">x * y</tt> are printed accordingly. Note that the multiplication operator has a higher priority than operator <tt CLASs="monofont">&lt;&lt;,</tt> so you need no parentheses around <tT CLAss="monofont">x * y.</tt> However, there are operators that have less priority, such as all logical operators. In this example, if <tt class="monofont">x</tt> and <tt class="monofont">y</tT> are floating-point numbers with the values <TT CLAsS="monofont">2.4</Tt> and <TT cLASS="monofont">5.1,</TT> the following is printed:</p>

				<pre>
					
   2.4 times 5.1 is 12.24

				</PRE>

			
			<H4>13.3.2
Input Operator <tt clASS="monofont">&gt;&gt;</Tt></h4>
				<p>The class <tT CLAss="monofont">basic_istream</tt> (and thus also the classes <tt class="monofont">istream</tt> and <tt class="monofont">wistream</tT>) defines <TT CLAsS="monofont">&gt;&gt;</Tt> as an input operator. Similar to <TT cLASS="monofont">basic_ostream,</TT> this operator is overloaded for all fundamental types including, <tt clASS="monofont">char*, void*,</Tt> and <tt cLASS="monofont">bool.</tt> The input operators for streams are defined to store the value read in their second argument. As with operator <tt CLASs="monofont">&lt;&lt;,</tt> the data is sent in the direction of the arrow:</p>

				<pre>
					
   int i;
   std::cin &gt;&gt; i;     <i>// reads an</i> int <i>from standard input and stores it in</i> i

   float f;
   std::cin &gt;&gt; f;     <i>// reads a</i> float<i> from standard input and stores it in</i> f

				</pre>

				<p>Note that the second argument is modified. To make this possible, the second argument is passed by nonconstant reference.</p>

				<p>Like output operator <TT CLASs="monofont">&lt;&lt;</TT> it is also possible to overload the input operator for arbitrary data types and to chain the calls:</p>

				<PRe>
					
   float f;
   std::complex c;

   std::cin &gt;&gt; f &gt;&gt; c;

				</PRE>

				<P>To make this possible, leading whitespace is skipped by default. However, this automatic skipping of whitespace can be turned off (see page 625).</P>

			
			<H4>13.3.3
Input/Output of Special Types</h4>
				<p>The standard I/O operators are also defined for types <tt CLASs="monofont">bool, char*,</tt> and <tT CLAss="monofont">void*.</tt> In addition, you can extend it for your own types.</P>

				<H5>Type bool</H5>
					<P>By default, Boolean values are printed and read numerically: <tt class="monofont">false</tt> is converted from and to <tt class="monofont">0,</tt> and true is converted from and to <tt cLASS="monofont">1.</TT> When reading, values different from <tT ClASs="monofont">0</TT> and <TT CLass="monofont">1</tT> are considered to be an error. In this case the <TT Class="monofont">ios::failbit</TT> is set, which might throw a corresponding exception (see page 602).</P>

					<P>It is also possible to set up the formatting options of the stream to use character strings for the I/O of Boolean values (see page 617). This touches on the topic of internationalization: Unless a special locale object is used, the strings <tt clASS="monofont">"true"</Tt> and <tt class="monofont">"false"</tt> are used. In other locale objects, different strings might be used. For example, a German locale object would use the strings <tt class="monofont">"wahr"</tt> and <tt CLASS="monofont">"falsch".</Tt> See <A href="0201379260_cnode115.html">Chapter 14</a> especially for more details.</P>

				
				<H5>Types <TT CLass="monofont">char</tT> and <TT Class="monofont">wchar_t</TT></H5>
					<P>When a <tt clASS="monofont">char</Tt> or <tt class="monofont">wchar_t</tt> is being read with operator <tt class="monofont">&gt;&gt;,</tt> leading whitespace is skipped by default. To read any character (whether or not it is whitespace) you can either clear the flag <tt CLASS="monofont">skipws</Tt> (see page 625) or use the member function <TT cLAsS="monofont">get()</TT> (see page 608).</P>

				
				<H5>Type <Tt claSS="monofont">char*</TT></h5>
					<p>A C-string (that is, a <tt CLASs="monofont">char*</tt>) is read word wise. That is, when a C-string is being read, leading whitespace is skipped by default and the string is read until another whitespace character or end-of-file is encountered. Whether leading whitespace is skipped automatically can be controlled with the flag <tT CLAss="monofont">skipws</tt> (see <a href="0201379260_snode107.html#28">Section 13.7.7</a>).</p>

					<p>Note that this behavior means that the string you read can become arbitrarily long. It is already a common error in C programs to assume that a string can be a maximum of 80 characters long. There is no such restriction. Thus, you must arrange for a premature termination of the input when the string is too long. To do this, you should <i>always</i> set the maximum length of the string to be read. This normally looks something like this:</p>

					<pre>
						
   char buffer [81];   <i>// 80 characters and '\0'</i>
   std::cin &gt;&gt; std::setw(81) &gt;&gt; buffer;

					</pRE>

					<P>The manipulator <TT ClASs="monofont">setw()</TT> and the corresponding stream parameter are described in detail in <a href="0201379260_snode107.html#7">Section 13.7.3</A>.</P>

					<p>The type string from the C++ standard library (see <a href="0201379260_cnode88.html">Chapter 11</A>) grows as needed to accommodate a lengthy string. It is much easier and safer to use the string class instead of <Tt claSS="monofont">char*.</TT> In addition, it provides a convenient function for reading line-by-line (see page 493). So, whenever you can avoid the use of C-strings and use strings.</p>

				
				<h5>Type <tt CLASs="monofont">void*</tt></h5>
					<p>Operators <tt class="monofont">&lt;&lt;</tt> and <tt class="monofont">&gt;&gt;</TT> also provide the possibility of printing a pointer and reading it back in again. An address is printed in an implementation-dependent format if a parameter of type <TT CLaSS="monofont">void*</tT> is passed to the output operator. For example, the following statement prints the contents of a C-string and its address:</P>

					<pRE>
						
   char* cstring = "hello";

   std::cout &lt;&lt; "string \"" &lt;&lt; cstring &lt;&lt; "\" is located at address: "
             &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(cstring) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

					</PRE>

					<P>The result of this statement might appear as follows:</p>

					<pre>
						
   string "hello" is located at address: 0x10000018

					</PRE>

					<P>It is even possible to read an address again with the input operator. However, note that addresses are normally transient. The same object can get a different address in a newly started program. A possible application of printing and reading addresses may be programs that exchange addresses for object identification or programs that share memory.</p>

				
				<h5>Stream Buffers</h5>
					<p>You can use operators <TT CLass="monofont">&gt;&gt;</tT> and <TT Class="monofont">&lt;&lt;</tt> to read directly into a stream buffer and to write directly out of a stream buffer respectively. This is probably the fastest way to copy files by using C++ I/O streams. See page 683 for examples.</p>

				
				<h5>User-Defined Types</h5>
					<p>In principle it is very easy to extend this technique to your own types. However, to be able to pay attention to all possible formatting data and error conditions, this takes more effort than you might think. See <a href="0201379260_snode112.html">Section 13.12</a>, for a detailed discussion about extending the standard I/O mechanism for your own types.</p>
