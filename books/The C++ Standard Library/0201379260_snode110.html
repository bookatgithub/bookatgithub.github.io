<FONT><h3>13.10
Connecting Input and Output Streams</h3>
			<p>Often you need to connect two streams. For example, you may want to ensure that text asking for input is written on the screen before the input is read. Another example is reading from and writing to the same stream. This is mainly of interest regarding files. A third example is the need to manipulate the same stream using different formats. This section discusses all of these techniques.</p>

			<A NAMe="1"></a><h4>13.10.1
Loose Coupling Using <tT CLAss="monofont">tie()</tt></H4>
				<P>You can tie a stream to an output stream. This means the buffers of both streams are synchronized in a way that the buffer of the output stream is flushed before each input or output of the other stream. That is, for the output stream, the function <TT class="monofont">flush()</tt> is called. <a href="0201379260_snode110.html#2">Table 13.37</a> lists the member functions defined in <tt class="monofont">basic_ios</tT> for tieing one stream to another.</P>

				<P>Calling the function <TT ClASs="monofont">tie()</TT> without any argument returns a pointer to the output stream that is currently tied to a stream. To tie a new output stream to a stream, a pointer to that output stream must be passed as the argument to <tT CLASS="monofont">tie().</tt> The argument is a pointer because you can also pass <tt CLASs="monofont">0</tt> or <tT CLAss="monofont">NULL</tt> as an argument. This argument means "no tie," and unties any tied output stream. <TT CLass="monofont">0</tt> is also returned by <tt class="monofont">tie()</tt> if no output stream is tied. For each stream, you can only have one output stream that is tied to this stream. However, you can tie an output stream to different streams.</p>

				<P>By default, the standard input is connected to the standard output using this mechanism:</P>

				<PRE>
					
   <I>// predefined connections:</i>
   std::cin.tie (&amp;std::cout);
   std::wcin.tie (&amp;std::wcout);

				</PRe>

				<P>This ensures that a message asking for input is flushed before requesting the input. For example, during the statements</P>

				<pRE>
					
   std::cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter x: ";
   std::cin &gt;&gt; x;

				</PRE>

				<P>the function <tt clASS="monofont">flush()</Tt> is called implicitly for cout before reading <tt cLASS="monofont">x.</tt></p>

				<p>To remove the connection between two streams, you pass <TT CLass="monofont">0</tt> or <tt class="monofont">NULL</tt> to <tt class="monofont">tie().</TT> For example:</P>

				<PRE>
					
   <i>// decouple</I> cin<I> from any output stream</i>
   std::cin.tie (static_cast&lt;std::ostream*&gt;(0));

				</PRe>

				<P>This might improve the performance of a program because it avoids unnecessary additional flushing of streams (see Section 3, page 683, for a discussion of stream performance).</P>

				<P>You can also tie one output stream to another output stream. For example, the following statement arranges that before something is written to the error stream, the normal output is flushed:</P>

				<PRe>
					
   <i>// tieing</i> cout <i>to</I> cerr
   cerr.tie (&amp;cout);

Tight Coupling Using Stream Buffers</H4>
				<p>Using the function <tt cLASS="monofont">rdbuf(),</tt> you can couple streams tightly by using a common stream buffer (<a href="0201379260_snode110.html#4">Table 13.38</a>). These functions suit several purposes, which are discussed in this and the following subsections.</p>

				<p><tt class="monofont">rdbuf()</tt> allows several stream objects to read from the same input channel or to write to the same output channel without garbling the order of the I/O. The use of multiple stream buffers does not work smoothly because the I/O operations are buffered. Thus, when using different streams with different buffers for the same I/O channel means that I/O may pass other I/O. An additional constructor of <tt CLASS="monofont">basic_istream</Tt> and <TT cLAsS="monofont">basic_ostream</TT> is used to initialize the stream with a stream buffer passed as the argument. For example:</P>

				</pRE>

				<P>Note that the destructor of the classes <Tt claSS="monofont">basic_istream</TT> and <tt class="monofont">basic_ostream</tt> does <i>not</i> delete the corresponding stream buffer (it was not opened by these classes anyway). Thus, you can pass a stream device by using a pointer to the stream buffer instead of a stream reference:</p>

				<pre>
					
   <i>// io/rdbuf2.cpp</i>

   #include &lt;iostream&gt;
   #include &lt;fstream&gt;

   void hexMultiplicationTable (std::streambuf* buffer, int num)
   {
        std::ostream hexout(buffer);
        hexout &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; std::showbase;

        for (int i=1; i&lt;=num; ++i) {
            for (int j=1; j&lt;=10; ++j) {
                hexout &lt;&lt; i*j &lt;&lt; ' ';
            }
            hexout &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        }

    }   <i>// does NOT close buffer</i>

   int main()
   {
       using namespace std;
       int num = 5;

       cout &lt;&lt; "We print " &lt;&lt; num
            &lt;&lt; " lines hexadecimal" &lt;&lt; endl;

       hexMultiplicationTable(cout.rdbuf(),num);

       cout &lt;&lt; "That was the output of " &lt;&lt; num
            &lt;&lt; " hexadecimal lines " &lt;&lt; endl;
   }

				</prE>

				<P>The advantage of this approach is that the format does not need to be restored to its original state after it is modified because the format applies to the stream object, not to the stream buffer. Thus, the corresponding output of the program is as follows:</P>

				<PRE>
					
   We print 5 lines hexadecimal
   0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8 0x9 0xa
   0x2 0x4 0x6 0x8 0xa 0xc 0xe 0x10 0x12 0x14
   0x3 0x6 0x9 0xc 0xf 0x12 0x15 0x18 0x1b 0x1e
   0x4 0x8 0xc 0x10 0x14 0x18 0xlc 0x20 0x24 0x28
   0x5 0xa 0xf 0x14 0x19 0xle 0x23 0x28 0x2d 0x32
   That was the output of 5 hexadecimal lines

				</pRE>

				<p>However, this has the disadvantage that construction and destruction of a stream object involves more overhead than just setting and restoring some format flags. Also note that the destruction of a stream object does not flush the buffer. To make sure that an output buffer is flushed, it has to be flushed manually.</P>

				<P>The fact that the stream buffer is not destroyed applies only to <tT CLASS="monofont">basic_istream</tt> and <tt CLASs="monofont">basic_ostream.</tt> The other stream classes destroy the stream buffers they allocated originally, but they do not destroy stream buffers set with <tT CLAss="monofont">rdbuf()</tt> (for more details see the next subsection).</P>

			
			<A NAme="5"></a><h4>13.10.3
Redirecting Standard Streams</h4>
				<p>In the old implementation of the IOStream library, the global streams <tt class="monofont">cin, cout, cerr,</tt> and <tt clasS="monofont">clog</TT> were objects of the classes <TT ClASs="monofont">istream_withassign</TT> and <tT CLASS="monofont">ostream_withassign.</tt> It was therefore possible to redirect the streams by assigning streams to other streams. This possibility was removed from the C++ standard library. However, the possibility to redirect streams was retained and extended to apply to all streams. A stream can be redirected by setting a stream buffer.</p>

				<p>The setting of stream buffers means the redirection of I/O streams controlled by the program without help from the operating system. For example, the following statements set things up such that output written to cout is not sent to the standard output channel but rather to the file <TT CLass="monofont">cout.txt:</tT></P>

				<PRe>
					
    std::ofstream file ("cout.txt");
    std::cout.rdbuf (file.rdbuf());

				</pre>

				<P>The function <TT Class="monofont">copyfmt()</tt> can be used to assign all format information of a given stream to another stream object:</p>

				<pre>
					
    std::ofstream file ("cout.txt");
    file.copyfmt (std::cout);
    std::cout.rdbuf (file.rdbuf());

				</pre>

				<p><b>Caution!</b> The object <tt claSS="monofont">file</TT> is local and is destroyed at the end of the block. This also destroys the corresponding stream buffer. This differs from the "normal" streams because file streams allocate their stream buffer objects at construction time and destroy them on destruction. Thus, in this example, <TT cLAsS="monofont">cout</Tt> can no longer be used for writing. Actually, it cannot even be destroyed safely at program termination. Thus, the old buffer should <I>always</I> be saved and restored later! The following example does this in the function <TT CLass="monofont">redirect():</tT></P>

				<PRe>
					
   <i>// io/redirect.cpp</i>

   #include &lt;iostream&gt;
   #include &lt;fstream&gt;
   using namespace std;

   void redirect(ostream&amp;);

   int main()
   {
         cout &lt;&lt; "the first row" &lt;&lt; endl;

         redirect (cout);

         cout &lt;&lt; "the last row" &lt;&lt; endl;
   }

   void redirect (ostream&amp; strm)
   {
       ofstream file("redirect.txt");

       <i>// save output buffer of the stream</I>
       streambuf* strm_buffer = strm.rdbuf();

       <I>// redirect ouput into the file</I>
       strm.rdbuf (file.rdbuf());

       file &lt;&lt; "one row for the file" &lt;&lt; endl;
       strm &lt;&lt; "one row for the stream" &lt;&lt; endl;

       <I>// restore old output buffer</i>
       strm.rdbuf (strm_buffer);

   }    <i>// closes file AND its buffer automatically</i>

				</pRE>

				<P>The output of the program is this</P>

				<pre>
					
   the first row
   the last row

				</pre>

				<p>and the contents of the file <tt class="monofont">redirect.txt</tt> are</p>

				<pre>
					
   one row for the file
   one row for the stream

				</pRE>

				<P>As you can see, the output written in <TT ClASs="monofont">redirect()</TT> to <tT CLASS="monofont">cout</tt> (using the parameter name <tt CLASs="monofont">strm</tt>) is sent to the file. The output written after the execution of <tT CLAss="monofont">redirect()</tt> in <TT CLass="monofont">main()</tt> is sent to the restored output channel.</p>

			
			<h4>13.10.4
Streams for Reading and Writing</h4>
				<p>A final example of the connection between streams is the use of the same stream for reading and writing. Normally, a file can be opened for reading and writing using the class <tt class="monofont">fstream:</tt></p>

				<prE>
					
   std::fstream file ("example.txt", std::ios::in | std::ios::out);

				</PRE>

				<P>It is also possible to use two different stream objects, one for reading and one for writing. This can be done, for example, with the following declarations:</P>

				<pRE>
					
   std::ofstream out ("example.txt", ios::in | ios::out);
   std::istream in (out.rdbuf());

				</pRE>

				<p>The declaration of out opens the file. The declaration of in uses the stream buffer of <TT CLASs="monofont">out</tt> to read from it. Note that out must be opened for both reading and writing. If it is only opened for writing, reading from the stream will result in undefined behavior. Also note that in is not of type if stream but only of type <tT CLAss="monofont">istream.</tt> The file is already opened and there is a corresponding stream buffer. All that is needed is a second stream object. As in previous examples, the file is closed when the file stream object out is destroyed.</P>

				<P>It is also possible to create a file stream buffer and install it in both stream objects. The code looks like this:</P>

				<Pre>
					
   std::filebuf buffer;
   std::ostream out (&amp;buffer);
   std::istream in (&amp;buffer);
   buffer.open("example.txt", std::ios::in | std::ios::out);

				</prE>

				<P><TT class="monofont">filebuf</tt> is the usual specialization of the class <tt class="monofont">basic.filebuf&lt;&gt;</tt> for the character type char. This class defines the stream buffer class used by file streams.</p>

				<p>The following program is a complete example. In a loop, four lines are written to a file. After each writing of a line, the whole contents of the file are written to standard output:</p>

				<prE>
					
   <I>// io/rw1. cpp</I>

   #include &lt;iostream&gt;
   #include &lt;fstream&gt;
   using namespace std;

   int main()
   {
       <I>// open file "example.dat" for reading and writing</I>
       filebuf buffer;
       ostream output(&amp;buffer);
       istream input(&amp;buffer);
       buffer.open ("example.dat", ios::in | ios::out | ios::trunc);

       for (int i=1; i&lt;=4; i++) {
           <I>// write one line</i>
           output &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ". line" &lt;&lt; endl;

          <I>// print all file contents</I>
          input.seekg(0);              <i>//seek to the beginning</I>
          char c;
          while (input.get(c)) {
              cout.put(c);
          }
          cout &lt;&lt; endl;
          input.clear();               <I>//clear</i> eofbit <I>and</I> failbit
       }
   }

				</PRE>

				<P>The output of the program is as follows:</p>

				<pre>
					
   1. line

   1. line
   2. line

   1. line
   2. line
   3. line

   1. line
   2. line
   3. line
   4. line

				</PRE>

				<P>Although two different stream objects are used for reading and writing, the read and write positions are tightly coupled. <tt clASS="monofont">seekg()</Tt> and <tt cLASS="monofont">seekp()</tt> call the same member function of the stream buffer.<font size="1"><sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a></suP></FONT>
 Thus, the read position must always be set to the beginning of the file in order for the complete contents of the file to be written. After the whole contents of the file are written, the read/write position is again at the end of the file so that new lines are appended to the file.</P>
<bLOcKQuOTE><FONt sizE="1">
<P CLass="footnote">
<sUP><A Name="FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a></SUP>
Actually, this function can distinguish whether the read position, the write position, or both positions are to he modified. Only the standard stream buffers maintain one position for reading and writing.</P>
</font></blockquote>

				<p>It is important to perform a seek between read and write operations to the same file unless you have reached the end of the file while reading. Without this seek you are likely to end up with a garbled file or with even more fatal errors.</p>

				<p>As mentioned before, instead of processing character-by-character, you could also print the entire contents in one statement by passing a pointer to the stream buffer of the file as an argument to operator <tt clASS="monofont">&lt;&lt;</TT> (see page 683 for details):</P>

				<pRE>
