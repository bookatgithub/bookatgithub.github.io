<FONT><h3>2.1
History</h3>
			<p>The standardization of C++ was started in 1989 and finished at the end of 1997, although some formal motions delayed the final publication until September 1998. The result was a reference manual with approximately 750 pages, published by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The standard has the title <i>"Information Technology — Programming Languages — C++."</I> Its document number is ISO/IEC 14882-1998, and it is distributed by the national bodies of the ISO, such as the ANSI in the United States.<FONt sizE="1"><SUP><a hreF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></SUp></font>

At the time this book was written, you could get the C++ standard at the ANSI Electronics Standard Store for $ 18.00 (US; see <a tARGEt="_blank" hreF="http://www.ansi.org/default.htm">http://www.ansi.org/</A>).</P>

			<p>The standard was an important milestone for C++. Because it defines the exact contents and behavior of C++, it makes it easier to teach C++, to use C++ in applications, and to port C++ programs to different platforms. It also gives users greater freedom of choice regarding different C++ implementations. Its stability and portability help library providers and tool providers as well as implementers. Thus, the standard helps C++ application developers build better applications faster, and maintain them with less cost and effort.</p>

			<p>Part of the standard is a standard library. This library provides core components for I/O, strings, containers (data structures), algorithms (such as sort, search, and merge), support for numeric computation, and (as could be expected from an international standard) support for internationalization (such as different character sets).</p>

			<p>You may wonder why the standardization process took almost 10 years, and if you know some details about the standard you might wonder why after all this time it is still not perfect. Ten years, in fact, was not enough time! Although, according to the history and the context of the standardization process, a lot was accomplished. The result is usable in practice, but it is not perfect (nothing ever is).</p>

			<p>The standard is not the result of a company with a big budget and a lot of time. Standards organizations pay nothing or almost nothing to the people who work on developing standards. So, if a participant doesn't work for a company that has a special interest in the standard, the work is done for fun. Thank goodness there were a lot of dedicated people who had the time and the money to do just that.</p>

			<p>The C++ standard was not developed from scratch. It was based on the language as described by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++. The standard library, however, was not based on a book or on an existing library. Instead, different, existing classes were integrated.<font sizE="1"><SUP><A HrEF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></SUp></FONT>
 Thus, the result is not very homogeneous. You will find different design principles for different components. A good example is the difference between the string class and the STL, which is a framework for data structures and algorithms:</P>

You may wonder why the standardization process did not design a new library from scratch. The major purpose of standardization is not to invent or to develop something; it is to harmonize an existing practice.</p>
</font></blockQUOTE>

				
			<Ul>
<LI><p>String classes are designed as a safe and convenient component. Thus, they provide an almost self-explanatory interface and check for many errors in the interface.</P>
</Li>
<LI><P>The STL was designed to combine different data structures with different algorithms while achieving the best performance. Thus, the STL is not very convenient and it is not required to check for many logical errors. To benefit from the powerful framework and great performance of the STL, you must know the concepts and apply them carefully.</P>

				</LI>
</ul>
			<p>Both of these components are part of the same library. They were harmonized a bit, but they still follow their individual, fundamental design philosophies.</p>

			<P>One component of the library existed as a de facto standard before standardization began: the IOStream library. Developed in 1984, it was reimplemented and partially redesigned in 1989. Because many programs were using it already, the general concept of the IOStream library was not changed, thus keeping it backward compatible.</P>

			<P>In general, the whole standard (language and library) is the result of a lot of discussions and influence from hundreds of people all over the world. For example, the Japanese came up with important support for internationalization. Of course, mistakes were made, minds were changed, and people had different opinions. Then, in 1994, when people thought the standard was close to being finished, the STL was incorporated, which changed the whole library radically. However, to get finished, the thinking about major extensions was eventually stopped, regardless of how useful the extension would be. Thus, hash tables are not part of the standard, although they should be a part of the STL as a common data structure.</P>

			<p>The current standard is not the end of the road. There will be fixes of bugs and inconsistencies, and there likely will be a next version of the standard in five years or so. However for the next few years, C++ programmers have a standard and the chance to write powerful code that is portable to very different platforms.</p>
