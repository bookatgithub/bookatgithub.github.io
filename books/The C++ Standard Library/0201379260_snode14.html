<FONT><h3>2.2
New Language Features</h3>
			<p>The core language and the library of C++ were standardized in parallel. In this way, the library could benefit from improvements in the language and the language could benefit from experiences of library implementation. In fact, during the standardization process the library often used special language features that were not yet available.</p>

			<P>C++ is not the same language it was five years ago. If you didn't follow its evolution, you may be surprised with the new language features used by the library. This section gives you a brief overview of those new features. For details, refer to books on the language in question.</P>

			<P>While I was writing this book (in 1998), not all compilers were able to provide all of the new language features. I hope (and expect) that this will change very soon (most compiler vendors were part of the standardization process). Thus, you may be restricted in your use of the library. Portable implementations of the library typically consider whether features are present in the environment they use (they usually have some test programs to check which language features are present, and then set preprocessor directives according to the result of the check). I'll mention any restrictions that are typical and important throughout the book by using footnotes.</P>

			<p>The following subsections describe the most important new language features that are relevant for the C++ standard library.</p>

			<h4>2.2.1
Templates</h4>
				<P>Almost all parts of the library are written as templates. Without template support, you can't use the standard library. Moreover, the library needed new special template features, which I introduce after a short overview of templates.</P>

				<P>Templates are functions or classes that are written for one or more types not yet specified. When you use a template, you pass the types as arguments, explicitly or implicitly. The following is a typical example <Tt claSS="monofont">—</TT> a function that returns the maximum of two values:</p>

				<pre>
					
   template &lt;class T&gt;
   inline const T&amp; max (const T&amp; a, const T&amp; b)
   {
       <i>// if</i> a &lt;b <i>then use</i> b <i>else use</i> a
       return  a &lt; b ? b : a;
   }
</pre>

				<p>Here, the first line defines <tt class="monofont">T</TT> as an arbitrary data type that is specified by the caller when the caller calls the function. You can use any identifier as a parameter name, but using <TT CLaSS="monofont">T</tT> is very common, if not a de facto convention. The type is classified by <Tt CLASS="monofont">class,</Tt> although it does not have to be a class. You can use any data type as long as it provides the operations that the template uses.<fonT SIZe="1"><sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a></suP></FONt>
</p>
<blockquote><font size="1">
<p CLASS="footnote">
<SuP><A nAMe="FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</A></SUP>
<TT clasS="monofont">class</TT> was used here to avoid the introduction of a new keyword when templates were introduced. However, now there is a new keyword, <Tt claSS="monofont">typename,</TT> that you can also use here (see page 11).</p>
</fonT></BLOckquote>

					
				<p>Following the same principle, you can "parameterize" classes on arbitrary types. This is useful for container classes. You can implement the container operations for an arbitrary element type. The C++ standard library provides many template container classes (for example, see <a href="0201379260_cnode46.html">Chapter 6</a> or <a href="0201379260_cnode82.html">Chapter 10</a>). It also uses template classes for many other reasons. For example, the string classes are parameterized on the type of the characters and the properties of the character set (see <a href="0201379260_cnode88.html">Chapter 11</A>).</P>

				<p>A template is not compiled once to generate code usable for any type; instead, it is compiled for each type or combination of types for which it is used. This leads to an important problem in the handling of templates in practice: You must have the implementation of a template function available when you call it, so that you can compile the function for your specific type. Therefore, the only portable way of using templates at the moment is to implement them in header files by using inline functions.<FOnT SiZE="1"><SUP><A href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</A></SUP></font>
</P>
<BLOckquOTE><Font size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</A></SUP>
To avoid the problem of templates having to be present in header files, the standard introduced a <I>template compilation model</I> with the keyword <tT ClASs="monofont">export.</TT> However, I have not seen it implemented yet.</P>
</FONt></bloCKQUote>

					
				<p>The full functionality of the C++ standard library requires not only the support of templates in general, but also many new standardized template features, including those discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>

				<H5>Nontype Template Parameters</H5>
					<P>In addition to type parameters, it is also possible to use nontype parameters. A nontype parameter is then considered as part of the type. For example, for the standard class <tt clASS="monofont">bitset&lt;&gt;</Tt> (class <tt class="monofont">bitset&lt;&gt;</tt> is introduced in <a href="0201379260_snode87.html">Section 10.4</a>,) you can pass the number of bits as the template argument. The following statements define two bitfields, one with 32 bits and one with 50 bits:</p>

					<pre>
						
   bitset&lt;32&gt; fIags32;     <i>// bitset with 32 bits</I> 
   bitset&lt;50&gt; flags50;     <I>// bitset with 50 bits</I>
</PRE>

					<p>These bitsets have different types because they use different template arguments. Thus, you can't assign or compare them (except if a corresponding type conversion is provided).</P>

				
				<H5>Default Template Parameters</h5>
					<P>Templates classes may have default arguments. For example, the following declaration allows one to declare objects of class <Tt CLASS="monofont">MyClass</Tt> with one or two template arguments<fonT SIZe="1"><sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a></suP></FONt>
:</p>
<blockquote><font size="1">
<p CLASS="footnote">
<SuP><A nAMe="FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</A></SUP>
Note that you have to put a space between the two "<TT clasS="monofont">&gt;</TT>" characters. "<Tt claSS="monofont">&gt;&gt;</TT>" would be parsed as shift operator, which would result in a syntax error.</p>
</fonT></BLOckquote>

					<pre>
						
   template &lt;class T, class container = vector&lt;T&gt; &gt;
   class MyClass;
</pre>

					<p>If you pass only one argument, the default parameter is used as second argument:</p>

					<pre>
						
   MyClass&lt;int&gt; x1;          <i>// equivalent to:</i> MyClass&lt;int,vector&lt;int&gt; &gt;
</pRE>

					<P>Note that default template arguments may be defined in terms of previous arguments.</P>

				
				<H5>Keyword <Tt CLaSS="monofont">typename</tT></H5>
					<P>The keyword <TT Class="monofont">typename</TT> was introduced to specify that the identifier that follows is a type. Consider the following example:</P>

					<Pre>
						
   template &lt;class T&gt; 
   Class MyClass {
      typename T::SubType * ptr;
      ...
   };
</prE>

					<P>Here, <TT clasS="monofont">typename</TT> is used to clarify that <Tt class="monofont">SubType</tt> is a type of class <tt class="monofont">T.</tt> Thus, <tt clASS="monofont">ptr</TT> is a pointer to the type <Tt CLaSS="monofont">T::SubType.</tT> Without <TT CLAss="monofont">typename, SubType</tt> would be considered a static member. Thus</P>

					<PRE>
						
   T::SubType * ptr
</pre>

					<p>would be a multiplication of value <TT CLass="monofont">SubType</tT> of type <TT Class="monofont">T</tt> with <tt class="monofont">ptr.</tt></p>

					<p>According to the qualification of <tt clASS="monofont">SubType</TT> being a type, any type that is used in place of <Tt CLaSS="monofont">T</tT> must provide an inner type <TT CLAss="monofont">SubType.</tt> For example, the use of type <TT CLass="monofont">Q</tT> as a template argument</P>

					<PRe>
						
   MyClass&lt;Q&gt; x;
</pre>

					<P>is possible only if type <TT Class="monofont">Q</tt> has an inner type definition such as the following:</p>

					<pre>
						
   class Q {
       typedef int SubType;
       ...
   };
</pre>

					<p>In this case, the <tt class="monofont">ptr</TT> member of <TT CLaSS="monofont">MyClass&lt;Q&gt;</tT> would be a pointer to type <Tt CLASS="monofont">int.</Tt> However, the subtype could also be an abstract data type (such as a class):</p>

					<prE>
						
   class Q {
       class SubType;
       ...
   };
</PRE>

					<p>Note that <tt cLASS="monofont">typename</tt> is always necessary to qualify an identifier of a template as being a type, even if an interpretation that is not a type would make no sense. Thus, the general rule in C++ is that any identifier of a template is considered to be a value, except it is qualified by <tt CLASs="monofont">typename.</tt></p>

					<p>Apart from this, <tt class="monofont">typename</tt> can also be used instead of <tt class="monofont">class</TT> in a template declaration:</P>

					<PRE>
						
   template &lt;typename T&gt; class MyClass;
</pRE>

				
				<h5>Member Templates</H5>
					<P>Member functions of classes may be templates. However, member templates may not be virtual, nor may they have default parameters. For example:</p>

					<PRE>
						
   class MyClass {
       ...
       template &lt;class T&gt;
       void f(T);
   };
</PRE>

					<p>Here, <tt cLASS="monofont">MyClass::f</tt> declares a set of member functions for parameters of any type. You can pass any argument as long as its type provides all operations used by <tt CLASs="monofont">f().</tt></p>

					<P>This feature is often used to support automatic type conversions for members in template classes. For example, in the following definition the argument <TT Class="monofont">x</tt> of <tt class="monofont">assign()</tt> must have exactly the same type as the object it is called for:</p>

					<pre>
						
   template &lt;class T&gt;
   class MyClass {
     private:
       T value;
     public:
       void assign(const MyClass&lt;T&gt;&amp; x) { // x <i>must have same type as</i> *this
           value = x.value;
       }
       ...
   };
</PRE>

					<P>It would be an error to use different template types for the objects of the <TT cLAsS="monofont">assign()</Tt> operation even if an automatic type conversion from one type to the other is provided:</P>

					<PRE>
						
   void f()
   {
       MyClass&lt;double&gt; d;
       MyClass&lt;int&gt; i;


       d.assign(d);   <I>//OK</I>
       d.assign(i);   <i>//ERROR:</i> i <i>is</i> MyClass&lt;int&gt;
                      <I>//        but</I> MyClass&lt;double&gt; <I>is required</I>
   }
</pre>

					<p>By providing a different template type for the member function, you relax the rule of exact match. The member template function argument may have any template type, then as long as the types are assignable:</P>

					<PRE>
						
   template &lt;class T&gt;
   class MyClass&lt;T&gt; {
     private:
       T value;
     public
       template &lt;class X&gt;                      <i>// member template</i>
       void assign(const MyClass&lt;X&gt;&amp; x) {      <i>// allows different template types</i>
           value = x.getValue();
       }
       T getValue() const {
           return value;
       }
       ...
   };


   void f()
   {
       MyClass&lt;double&gt; d;
       MyClass&lt;int&gt; i;


       d.assign(d);   <I>// OK</I>
       d.assign(i);   <I>// OK (</I>int <i>is assignable to</i> double)
   }
</pre>

					<p>Note that the argument <tt class="monofont">x</tt> of <tt clasS="monofont">assign()</TT> now differs from the type of <TT ClASs="monofont">*this.</TT> Thus, you can't access private and protected members of <tT CLASS="monofont">MyClass&lt;&gt;</tt> directly. Instead, you have to use something like <tt CLASs="monofont">getValue()</tt> in this example.</p>

					<P>A special form of a member template is a <I>template constructor.</I> Template constructors are usually provided to enable implicit type conversions when objects are copied. Note that a template constructor does not hide the implicit copy constructor. If the type matches exactly, the implicit copy constructor is generated and called. For example:</P>

					<pre>
						
   template &lt;class T&gt;
   class MyClass&lt;T&gt; {
     public:
       <i>//copy constructor with implicit type conversion</I>
       <I>//- does not hide implicit copy constructor</I>
       template &lt;class U&gt;
       MyClass(const MyClass&lt;U&gt;&amp; x);
       ...
   };


   void f()
   {
       MyClass&lt;double&gt; xd;
       ...
       MyClass&lt;double&gt; xd2(xd);     <I>// calls built-in copy constructor</i>
       MyClass&lt;int&gt; xi (xd);        <i>// calls template constructor</i>
       ...
   }
</pre>

					<p>Here, the type of <tt class="monofont">xd2</tt> is the same as the type of <tt claSS="monofont">xd,</TT> so it is initialized via the built-in copy constructor. The type of <TT cLAsS="monofont">xi</Tt> differs from the type of <TT CLASs="monofont">xd,</tt> so it is initialized by using the template constructor. Thus, if you write a template constructor, don't forget to provide a copy constructor, if the default copy constructor does not fit your needs. See <a href="0201379260_snode24.html">Section 4.1</a>, for another example of member templates.</p>

				
				<h5>Nested Template Classes</h5>
					<P>Nested classes may also be templates:</P>

					<PRe>
						
   template &lt;class T&gt;
   class MyClass {
       ...
       template &lt;class T2&gt;
       class NestedClass;
       ...
   };
</pre>

				
			
			<A NAMe="10"></a><h4>2.2.2
Explicit Initialization for Fundamental Types</h4>
				<p>If you use the syntax of an explicit constructor call without arguments, fundamental types are initialized with zero:</p>

				<pre>
					
   int i1;             <i>// undefined value</i>
   int i2 = int();     <i>// initialized with zero</i>
</pre>

				<p>This feature is provided to enable you to write template code that ensures that values of any type have a certain default value. For example, in the following function the initialization guarantees that <tt clASS="monofont">x</TT> is initialized with zero for fundamental types:</P>

				<pRE>
					
   template &lt;class T&gt;
   void f()
   {
       T x = T();
       ...
   }
</pRE>

			
			<h4>2.2.3
Exception Handling</H4>
				<P>The C++ standard library uses exception handling. Using this feature, you can handle exceptions without "polluting" your function interfaces: arguments and return values. If you encounter an unexpected situation, you can stop the usual data processing by "throwing an exception":</P>

				<PRE>
					
   class Error;


   void f()
   {
        ...
        if (<i>excetion-condition</i>) {
            throw Error();                 <i>// create object of class</i> Error <I>and throw it 
<DIV><img bORDEr="0" aliGN="left" WIdth="14" height="9" src="FILES/ccc.gif" alt="graphics/ccc.gif"></div>as exception</i>
        }
        ...
   }
</prE>

				<P>The <TT CLaSS="monofont">throw</tT> statement starts a process called <I>stack unwinding;</i> that is, any block or function is left as if there was a <TT CLASs="monofont">return</tt> statement. However, the program does not jump anywhere. For all local objects that are declared in the blocks that the program leaves due to the exception their destructors are called. Stack unwinding continues until <tT CLAss="monofont">main()</tt> is left, which ends the program, or until a <TT CLass="monofont">catch</tT> clause "catches" and handles the exception:</P>

				<PRe>
					
   int main()
   {
       try {
           ...
           f();
           ...
       }
       catch (const Error&amp;) {
           ... <i>//handle exception</i>
       }
       ...
   }
</pre>

				<p>Here, any exception of type <tt class="monofont">Error</tt> in the <tt claSS="monofont">try</TT> block is handled in the <TT cLAsS="monofont">catch</Tt> clause.<FONT SIze="1"><suP><A HRef="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></sUP></FOnt>
</p>
<bLOCKquote><font size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<suP><A NAME="FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></SUp>
Exceptions end a call of the function, where you find the exception, with the ability to pass an object as argument back to the caller. However, this is not a function call back in the opposite direction (from the bottom where the problem was found to the top where the problem is solved or handled). You can't process the exception and continue from where you found the exception. In this regard, exception handling is completely different from signal handling.</P>
</FoNT></BLOCkquoTE>

					
				<P>Exception objects are ordinary objects that are described in ordinary classes or ordinary fundamental types. Thus, you can use <Tt claSS="monofont">int</TT>s, strings, or template classes that are part of a class hierarchy. Usually you design (a hierarchy of) special error classes. You can use their state to pass any information you want from the point of error detection to the point of error handling.</p>

				<p>Note that the concept is called <i>exception handling</i> not <I>error handling.</I> The two are not necessarily the same. For example, in many circumstances bad user input is not an exception; it typically happens. So it is often a good idea to handle wrong user input locally using the usual error-handling techniques.</P>

				<P>You can specify which set of exceptions a function might throw by writing an <i>exception specification:</i></p>

				<pre>
					
   void f() throw(bad_alloc);  <i>//</i>f() <i>may only throw</i> bad_alloc <i>exceptions</i>
</pre>

				<p>You can specify that a function not throw an exception by declaring an empty set of exceptions:</p>

				<pre>
					
   void f() throw();           <i>//</I>f() <I>does not throw</I>
</PRE>

				<p>A violation of an exception specification causes special behavior to occur. See the description of the exception class <TT cLAsS="monofont">bad_exception</TT> on page 26 for details.</P>

				<P>The C++ standard library provides some general features for exception handling, such as the standard exception classes and class <Tt claSS="monofont">auto_ptr</TT> (see <a href="0201379260_snode28.html">Section 3.3</A>, and <A href="0201379260_snode27.html">Section 4.2</a>, for details).</P>

			
			<A NAme="13"></a><h4>2.2.4
Namespaces</h4>
				<p>As more and more software is written as libraries, modules, or components, the combination of these different parts might result in a name clash. Namespaces solve this problem.</p>

				<p>A <i>namespace</i> groups different identifiers in a named scope. By defining all identifiers in a namespace, the name of the namespace is the only global identifier that might conflict with other global symbols. Similar to the handling of classes, you have to qualify a symbol in a namespace by preceding the identifier with the name of the namespace, separated by the operator <tt class="monofont">::</tt> as follows:</p>

				<pRE>
					
   <I>//defining identifiers in namespace</I> josuttis
   namespace josuttis {
       class File;
       void myGlobalFunc();
       ...
   }
   ...


   <I>//using a namespace identifier</I>
   josuttis::File obj;
   ...
   josuttis::myGlobalFunc();
</pRE>

				<p>Unlike classes, namespaces are open for definitions and extensions in different modules. Thus you can use namespaces to define modules, libraries, or components even by using multiple files. A namespace defines logical modules instead of physical modules (in UML and other modeling notations, a module is also called a <I>package</I>).</p>

				<P>You don't have to qualify the namespace for functions if one or more argument types are defined in the namespace of the function. This rule is called <I>Koenig lookup.</I> For example:</P>

				<PRe>
					
   <i>//defining identifiers in namespace</i> josuttis
   namespace josuttis {
       class File;
       void myGlobalFunc(const File&amp;);
       ...
   }
   ...


   josuttis::File obj;
   ...
   myGlobalFunc(obj);   <i>//OK, lookup finds</I> josuttis::myGlobalFunc()
</PRE>

				<p>By using a <i>using declaration,</i> you can avoid the (remaining) tedious, repeated qualification of the namespace scope. For example, the declaration</p>

				<PRE>
					
   using josuttis::File;
</Pre>

				<p>makes <tT CLAss="monofont">File</tt> a local synonym in the current scope that stands for <tt class="monofont">josuttis::File.</tt></p>

				<p>A <i>using directive</i> makes all names of a namespace available, because they would have been declared outside their namespace. However, the usual name conflicts may arise. For example, the directive</p>

				<pre>
					
   using namespace josuttis;
</PRE>

				<P>makes <TT cLAsS="monofont">File</Tt> and <TT CLASs="monofont">myGlobalFunc()</tt> global in the current scope. The compiler will report an ambiguity if there also exists an identifier <tT CLAss="monofont">File</tt> or <TT CLass="monofont">myGlobalFunc()</tT> in the global scope and the user uses the name without qualification.</P>

				<P>Note that you should never use a using directive when the context is not clear (such as in header files, modules, or libraries). The directive might change the scope of identifiers of a namespace, so you might get different behavior than the one expected because you included or used your code in another module. In fact, using directives in header files is really bad design.</P>

				<p>The C++ standard library defines all identifiers in namespace <tt class="monofont">std.</tt> See <a href="0201379260_snode18.html">Section 3.1</a>, for details.</p>

			
			<h4>2.2.5
Type <tt cLASS="monofont">bool</TT></h4>
				<P>To provide better support for Boolean values, type <Tt CLaSS="monofont">bool</TT> was introduced. Using <TT clasS="monofont">bool</TT> increases readability and allows you to overload behavior for Boolean values. The literals <Tt claSS="monofont">true</TT> and <tt clASS="monofont">false</Tt> were introduced as Boolean values. Automatic type conversions to and from integral values are provided. The value <tt class="monofont">0</tt> is equivalent to <tt class="monofont">false.</tt> Any other value is equivalent to <tt CLASS="monofont">true.</Tt></P>

			
			<A nAMe="15"></A><H4>2.2.6
Keyword <TT CLass="monofont">explicit</tT></H4>
				<P>By using the keyword <Tt claSS="monofont">explicit,</TT> you can prohibit a single argument constructor from defining an automatic type conversion. A typical example of the need for this feature is in a collection class in which you can pass the initial size as constructor argument. For example, you could declare a constructor that has an argument for the initial size of a stack:</p>

				<pre>
					
   class Stack {
       explicit Stack(int size);      <I>// create stack with initial size</I>
       <I>...</I>
   };
</pre>

				<p>Here, the use of <tt class="monofont">explicit</tt> is rather important. Without <tt class="monofont">explicit</tT> this constructor would define an automatic type conversion from <TT CLAsS="monofont">int</Tt> to <TT cLASS="monofont">Stack.</TT> If this happens, you could assign an <tt clASS="monofont">int</Tt> to a <tt cLASS="monofont">Stack:</tt></p>

				<pRE>
					
   Stack s;
   ...
   s = 40;      <I>// Oops, creates a new</I> Stack <i>for 40 elements and assigns it to</i> s
</pre>

				<p>The automatic type conversion would convert the <tt class="monofont">40</tt> to a stack with 40 elements and then assign it to <tt clasS="monofont">s.</TT> This is probably not what was intended. By declaring the <TT ClASs="monofont">int</TT> constructor as <tT CLASS="monofont">explicit,</tt> such an assignment results in an error at compile time.</p>

				<p>Note that <TT CLass="monofont">explicit</tT> also rules out the initialization with type conversion by using the assignment syntax:</P>

				<PRe>
					
   Stack s1(40);        <i>// OK</i>
   Stack s2 = 40;       <i>// ERROR</I>
</PRE>

				<p>This is because there is a minor difference between</p>

				<pre>
					
   X x;
   Y y(x);       <i>// explicit conversion</i>
</pre>

				<p>and</p>

				<pre>
					
   X x;
   Y y = x;      <i>// implicit conversion</i>
</pre>

				<p>The former creates a new object of type <TT CLASs="monofont">Y</TT> by using an explicit conversion from type <tT ClASS="monofont">X,</TT> whereas the latter creates a new object of type <Tt claSS="monofont">Y</TT> by using an implicit conversion.</p>

			
			<h4>2.2.7
New Operators for Type Conversion</h4>
				<p>To enable you to clarify the meaning of an explicit type conversion for one argument, the following four new operators were introduced:</P>

				<OL Type="1" sTART="restarts">
<li><p><tt class="monofont">static_cast</tt></p>

						<p>This operator converts a value logically. It can be considered a creation of a temporary object that is initialized by the value that gets converted. The conversion is allowed only if a type conversion is defined (either as a built-in conversion rule or via a defined conversion operation). For example:</p>

						<pre>
							
   float x;
   ...
   cout &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;int&gt;(x);        <i>// print</i> x <i>as</I> int
   ...
   f(static_cast&lt;string&gt;("hello"));    <I>// call</I> f()<I> for</I> string <I>instead of</i> char<I>*</I>
</pRE>

					</lI>
<LI><P><TT clasS="monofont">dynamic_cast</TT></P>

						<p>This operator enables you to downcast a polymorphic type to its real static type. This is the only cast that is checked at runtime. Thus, you could also use it to check the type of a polymorphic value. For example:</p>

						<prE>
							
   class Car;         <I>// abstract base class (has at least one virtual function)</I>


   class Cabriolet : public Car {
       ...
   };


   class Limousine : public Car {
       ...
   };


   void f(Car* cp)
   {

       Cabriolet* p = dynamic_cast&lt;Cabriolet*&gt;(cp);
       if (p == NULL) {
           <I>//</i>p <i>did not refer to an object of type</i> Cabriolet
           ...
       }
   }
</pRE>

						<P>In this example, <Tt class="monofont">f()</tt> contains a special behavior for objects that have the real static type <tt class="monofont">Cabriolet.</tt> When the argument is a reference and the type conversion fails, <tt clASS="monofont">dynamic_cast</TT> throws a <Tt CLaSS="monofont">bad_cast</tT> exception (<TT CLAss="monofont">bad_cast</tt> is described on page 26). Note that from a design point of view, it it always better to avoid such type-dependent statements when you program with polymorphic types.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p><tt CLASs="monofont">const_cast</tt></p>

						<P>This operator adds or removes the <TT Class="monofont">const</tt>ness of a type. In addition, you can remove a <tt class="monofont">volatile</tt> qualification. Any other change of the type is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><TT CLASs="monofont">reinterpret_cast</TT></p>

						<P>The behavior of this operator is implementation defined. It may be but is not required to reinterpret bits. Using this cast is usually not portable.</P>

					</lI>
</OL>

				<P>These operators replace the old cast techniques that use parentheses. They have the advantage of clarifying the intention of the conversion. The old casts with parentheses could be used for any of these type conversions except for <TT clasS="monofont">dynamic_cast,</TT> so when they were used you could not formulate the exact reason for the conversion. The new operators enable the compiler to receive more information regarding the reason for the conversion and to report an error if the conversion does more than it should.</P>

				<blocKQUOte>
<p><p>Note that these operators are provided for only <I>one</I> argument. Consider the following example:</P>
</P>
</blockquote>
				<pre>
					
   static_cast&lt;Fraction&gt;(15,100)     <i>// Oops, creates</i> Fraction(l00)
</pre>

				<p>This example does not do what you might expect. Instead of initializing a temporary fraction with numerator 15 and denominator 100, it initializes a temporary fraction only with the single value 100. The comma is not an argument separator here. Instead, it is the comma operator that combines two expressions into one expression and yields the second. The correct way to "convert" values 15 and 100 into a fraction is still</p>

				<pRE>
					
   Fraction(15,100)                  <I>// fine, creates</I> Fraction(15,100)
</PRe>

			
			<H4>2.2.8
Initialization of Constant Static Members</H4>
				<p>It is now possible to initialize integral constant static members inside the class structure. This is useful when the constant is used in the class structure after the initialization. For example:</P>

				<PrE>
					
   class MyClass {
       static const int num = 100;
       int elems[num];
       ...
   };
</PRE>

				<P>Note that you still have to to define space for a constant static member that is initialized within a class definition:</P>

				<pre>
					
   const int MyClass::num;     <i>// no initialization here</I>
</PRE>

			
			<h4>2.2.9
Definition of <tt cLASS="monofont">main()</tt></h4>
				<p>I'd also like to clarify an important, often misunderstood, aspect of the core language — namely, the only correct and portable versions of <TT CLass="monofont">main().</tt> According to the C++ standard, only two definitions of <tt class="monofont">main()</tt> are portable:</p>

				<pre>
					
   int main()
   {
       ...
   }
</pre>

				<P>and</P>

				<PRE>
					
   int main (int argc, char* argv[])
   {
       ...
   }
</PrE>

				<P>where <tT ClASS="monofont">argv</TT> (the array of command-line arguments) might also be defined as <Tt claSS="monofont">char**.</TT> Note that the return type <tt clASS="monofont">int</Tt> is required because the implicit <tt cLASS="monofont">int</tt> is deprecated.</p>

				<p>You may, but are not required to, end <tt class="monofont">main()</tt> with a <tt class="monofont">return</tT> statement. Unlike C, C++ defines an implicit</P>

				<PRE>
					
   return 0;
</PrE>

				<P>at the end of <tT ClASS="monofont">main().</TT> This means that every program that leaves <Tt claSS="monofont">main()</TT> without a <tt clASS="monofont">return</Tt> statement is successful (any value other than <tt cLASS="monofont">0</tt> represents a kind of failure). Because of this, my examples in this book have no <tt class="monofont">return</tt> statement at the end of <tt class="monofont">main().</tt> Note that some compilers might print a warning message regarding this or even handle it as error. Well, that's life before the standard.</p>
