<FONT><h3>1.3
Style and Structure of the Book</h3>
			<p>The C++ standard library provides different components that are somewhat but not totally independent of each other, so there is no easy way to describe each part without mentioning others. I considered several different approaches for presenting the contents of this book. One was on the order of the C++ standard. However, this is not the best way to explain the components of the C++ standard library from scratch. Another was to start with an overview of all components followed by chapters that provided more details. Alternatively, I could have sorted the components, trying to find an order that had a minimum of cross-references to other sections. My solution was to use a mixture of all three approaches. I start with a brief introduction of the general concepts and the utilities that are used by the library. Then, I describe all the components, each in one or more chapters. The first component is the standard template library (STL). There is no doubt that the STL is the most powerful, most complex, and most exciting part of the library. Its design influences other components heavily. Then I describe the more self-explanatory components, such as special containers, strings, and numeric classes. The next component discussed is one you probably know and use already: the IOStream library. It is followed by a discussion of internationalization, which had some influence on the IOStream library.</p>

			<P>Each component description begins with the component's purpose, design, and some examples. Next, a detailed description follows that begins with different ways to use the component, as well as any traps and pitfalls associated with it. The description usually ends with a reference section, in which you can find the exact signature and definition of a component's classes and its functions.</P>

			<P>The following is a description of the book's contents. The first four chapters introduce this book and the C++ standard library in general:</P>

			<ul>
<li><P><A href="0201379260_cnode4.html">Chapter 1: About this Book</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="0201379260_cnode16.html">Chapter 3: General Concepts</A></P>

					<P>This chapter describes the fundamental concepts of the library that you need to understand to work with all the components. In particular, it introduces the namespace <TT cLAsS="monofont">std,</Tt> the format of header files, and the general support of error and exception handling.</P>
</LI>
<LI><P><a href="0201379260_cnode22.html">Chapter 4: Utilities</A></P>

					<P>This chapter describes several small utilities provided for the user of the library and for the library itself. In particular, it describes auxiliary functions such as <tt clASS="monofont">max(), min(),</Tt> and <tt cLASS="monofont">swap(),</tt> types <tt class="monofont">pair</tt> and <tt class="monofont">auto_ptr,</tt> as well as <tT CLASS="monofont">numeric_limits,</tT> which provide more information about implementation-specific details of numeric data types.</P>

</Ul>
			<P><A href="0201379260_cnode32.html">Chapters 5</a> through <a href="0201379260_cnode69.html">9</A> describe all aspects of the STL:</P>

			<ul>
<li><P><A href="0201379260_cnode32.html">Chapter 5: The Standard Template Library</a></p>

					<P>This chapter presents a detailed introduction to the concept of the STL, which provides container classes and algorithms that are used to process collections of data. It explains step-by-step the concept, the problems, and the special programming techniques of the STL, as well as the roles of its parts.</P>
</LI>
<li><p><a href="0201379260_cnode46.html">Chapter 6: STL Containers</a></p>

					<p>This chapter explains the concepts and describes the abilities of the STL's container classes. First it describes the differences between vectors, deques, lists, sets, and maps, then their common abilities, and all with typical examples. Lastly it lists and describes all container functions in form of a handy reference.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="0201379260_cnode58.html">Chapter 7: STL Iterators</A></P>

					<P>This chapter deals in detail with the STL's iterator classes. In particular, it explains the different iterator categories, the auxiliary functions for iterators, and the iterator adapters, such as stream iterators, reverse iterators, and insert iterators.</P>
</Li>
<LI><p><A href="0201379260_cnode64.html">Chapter 8: STL Function Objects</A></P>

					<P>This chapter details the STL's function object classes.</P>
</li>
<li><P><A href="0201379260_cnode69.html">Chapter 9: STL Algorithms</a></p>

					<P>This chapter lists and describes the STL's algorithms. After a brief introduction and comparison of the algorithms, each algorithm is described in detail followed by one or more example programs.</P>

				</LI>
</ul>
			<p><a href="0201379260_cnode82.html">Chapters 10</a> through <a href="0201379260_cnode93.html">12</a> describe "simple" individual standard classes:</p>

			<ul>
<li><p><a href="0201379260_cnode82.html">Chapter 10: Special Containers</a></p>

					<p>This chapter describes the different special container classes of the C++ standard library. It covers the container adapters for queues and stacks, as well as the class <TT CLASs="monofont">bitset,</TT> which manages a bitfield with an arbitrary number of bits or flags.</p>
</LI>
<lI><P><A href="0201379260_cnode88.html">Chapter 11: Strings</a></p>

					<p>This chapter describes the string types of the C++ standard library (yes, there are more than one). The standard provides strings as kind of "self-explanatory" fundamental data types with the ability to use different types of characters.</P>
</LI>
<Li><p><a href="0201379260_cnode93.html">Chapter 12: Numerics</A></p>

					<p>This chapter describes the numeric components of the C++ standard library. In particular, it covers types for complex numbers and classes for the processing of arrays of numeric values (the latter may be used for matrices, vectors, and equations).</p>

					<P>This chapter covers the I/O component of C++. This component is the standardized form of the commonly known IOStream library. The chapter also describes details that may be important to programmers but are typically not so well known. For example, it describes the correct way to define and integrate special I/O channels, which are often implemented incorrectly in practice.</P>
