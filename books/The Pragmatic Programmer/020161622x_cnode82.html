<FONT><h2>Appendix
A. Resources</h2><p>The only reason we were able to cover so much ground in this book is that we viewed many of our subjects from a high altitude. If we'd given them the in-depth coverage they deserved, the book would have been ten times longer.</p>
<P>We started the book with the suggestion that Pragmatic Programmers should always be learning. In this appendix we've listed resources that may help you with this process.</P>
<P>In the section <A href="020161622x_snode84.html">Professional Societies</A>, we give details of the IEEE and the ACM. We recommend that Pragmatic Programmers join one (or both) of these societies. Then, in <I>Building a Library,</I> we highlight periodicals, books, and Web sites that we feel contain high-quality and pertinent information (or that are just plain fun).</P>
<p>Throughout the book we referenced many software resources accessible via the Internet. In the <a href="020161622x_snode86.html">Internet Resources</A> section, we list the URLs of these resources, along with a short description of each. However, the nature of the Web means that many of these links may well be stale by the time you read this book. You could try one of the many search engines for a more up-to-date link, or visit our Web site at <A target="_blank" href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/default.htm">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com</a> and check our links section.</p>
<p>Finally, this appendix contains the book's bibliography.</p>
