<FONT><h3>Prototypes and Post-it Notes</h3>
			<p>Many different industries use prototypes to try out specific ideas; prototyping is much cheaper than full-scale production. Car makers, for example, may build many different prototypes of a new car design. Each one is designed to test a specific aspect of the car—the aerodynamics, styling, structural characteristics, and so on. Perhaps a clay model will be built for wind tunnel testing, maybe a balsa wood and duct tape model will do for the art department, and so on. Some car companies take this a step further, and now do a great deal of modeling work on the computer, reducing costs even further. In this way, risky or uncertain elements can be tried out without committing to building the real item.</p>

			<P>We build software prototypes in the same fashion, and for the same reasons—to analyze and expose risk, and to offer chances for correction at a greatly reduced cost. Like the car makers, we can target a prototype to test one or more specific aspects of a project.</P>

			<P>We tend to think of prototypes as code-based, but they don't always have to be. Like the car makers, we can build prototypes out of different materials. Post-it notes are great for prototyping dynamic things such as workflow and application logic. A user interface can be prototyped as a drawing on a whiteboard, as a nonfunctional mock-up drawn with a paint program, or with an interface builder.</P>

			<p>Prototypes are designed to answer just a few questions, so they are much cheaper and faster to develop than applications that go into production. The code can ignore unimportant details—unimportant to you at the moment, but probably very important to the user later on. If you are prototyping a GUI, for instance, you can get away with incorrect results or data. On the other hand, if you're just investigating computational or performance aspects, you can get away with a pretty poor GUI, or perhaps even no GUI at all.</p>

			<p>But if you find yourself in an environment where you <i>cannot</I> give up the details, then you need to ask yourself if you are really building a prototype at all. Perhaps a tracer bullet style of development would be more appropriate in this case (see <A href="020161622x_snode25.html">Tracer Bullets</a>).</p>

			<H4>Things to Prototype</H4>
				<P>What sorts of things might you choose to investigate with a prototype? Anything that carries risk. Anything that hasn't been tried before, or that is absolutely critical to the final system. Anything unproven, experimental, or doubtful. Anything you aren't comfortable with. You can prototype</P>

				<ul>
<li><p>Architecture</p>
</li>
<li><p>New functionality in an existing system</p>
</li>
<li><p>Structure or contents of external data</p>
</li>
<LI><P>Third-party tools or components</P>
</li>
<li><p>Performance issues</P>

<li><p>User interface design</P>

				<p>Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code produced, but in the lessons learned. That's really the point of prototyping.</p>

			<h4>How to Use Prototypes</h4>
				<p>When building a prototype, what details can you ignore?</p>

				<ul>
<li><p><b>Correctness.  </b>

							You may be able to use dummy data where appropriate.</p>
</li>
<LI><P><B>Completeness.  </b>

							The prototype may function only in a very limited sense, perhaps with only one preselected piece of input data and one menu item.</p>
</li>
<lI><p><B>Robustness.  </b>

							Error checking is likely to be incomplete or missing entirely. If you stray from the predefined path, the prototype may crash and burn in a glorious display of pyrotechnics. That's okay.</p>
</lI>
<LI><P><B>Style.  </b>

							It is painful to admit this in print, but prototype code probably doesn't have much in the way of comments or documentation. You may produce reams of documentation as a result of your experience with the prototype, but comparatively very little on the prototype system itself.</p>

					</li>
</UL>
				<P>Since a prototype should gloss over details, and focus in on specific aspects of the system being considered, you may want to implement prototypes using a very high-level language—higher than the rest of the project (maybe a language such as Perl, Python, or Tcl). A high-level scripting language lets you defer many details (including specifying data types) and still produce a functional (albeit incomplete or slow) piece of code.<Font sIZE="1"><Sup><a hREF="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</A></sup></font>
 If you need to prototype user interfaces, investigate tools such as Tcl/Tk, Visual Basic, Powerbuilder, or Delphi.</p>
<blockquote><foNT SIze="1">
<p clAsS="footnote">
<sup><A NAME="FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></sup>
If you are investigating absolute (instead of relative) performance, you will need to stick to a language that is close in performance to the target language.</P>
</FONt></bloCKQUote>

					
				<p>Scripting languages work well as the "glue" to combine low-level pieces into new combinations. Under Windows, Visual Basic can glue together COM controls. More generally, you can use languages such as Perl and Python to bind together low-level C libraries—either by hand, or automatically with tools such as the freely available SWIG [<A href="020161622x_snode86.html#32">URL 28</a>]. Using this approach, you can rapidly assemble existing components into new configurations to see how things work.</p>

			
			<h4>Prototyping Architecture</h4>
				<p>Many prototypes are constructed to model the entire system under consideration. As opposed to tracer bullets, none of the individual modules in the prototype system need to be particularly functional. In fact, you may not even need to code in order to prototype architecture—you can prototype on a whiteboard, with Post-it notes or index cards. What you are looking for is how the system hangs together as a whole, again deferring details. Here are some specific areas you may want to look for in the architectural prototype:</p>

				<ul>
<li><p>Are the responsibilities of the major components well defined and appropriate?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Are the collaborations between major components well defined?</p>
</lI>
<LI><P>Is coupling minimized?</p>
</li>
<li><P>Can you identify potential sources of duplication?</p>
</Li>
<li><P>Are interface definitions and constraints acceptable?</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>Does every module have an access path to the data it needs during execution? Does it have that access <i>when</i> it needs it?</P>

					</LI>
</Ul>
				<p>This last item tends to generate the most surprises and the most valuable results from the prototyping experience.</p>

			
			<h4>How Not to Use Prototypes</H4>
				<P>Before you embark on any code-based prototyping, make sure that everyone understands that you are writing disposable code. Prototypes can be deceptively attractive to people who don't know that they are just prototypes. You must make it <I>very</I> clear that this code is disposable, incomplete, and unable to be completed.</p>

				<p>It's easy to become misled by the apparent completeness of a demonstrated prototype, and project sponsors or management may insist on deploying the prototype (or its progeny) if you don't set the right expectations. Remind them that you can build a great prototype of a new car out of balsa wood and duct tape, but you wouldn't try to drive it in rush-hour traffic!</p>

				<p>If you feel there is a strong possibility in your environment or culture that the purpose of prototype code may be misinterpreted, you may be better off with the tracer bullet approach. You'll end up with a solid framework on which to base future development.</P>

				<P>When used properly, a prototype can save you huge amounts of time, money, pain, and suffering by identifying and correcting potential problem spots early in the development cycle—the time when fixing mistakes is both cheap and easy.</P>
