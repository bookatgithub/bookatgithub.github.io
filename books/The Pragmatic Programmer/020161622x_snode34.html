<FONT><h3>Source Code Control</h3>
			<p><i>Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.</I></P>

			<P><B>George Santayana,<i> Life of Reason</i></b></p>

			<P>One of the important things we look for in a user interface is the <IMG bordER="0" WIdth="50" height="26" src="FILES/undo.gif" alt="graphics/undo.gif"> key드 single button that forgives us our mistakes. It's even better if the environment supports multiple levels of undo and redo, so you can go back and recover from something that happened a couple of minutes ago. But what if the mistake happened last week, and you've turned your computer on and off ten times since then? Well, that's one of the many benefits of using a source code control system: it's a giant <img boRDER="0" width="50" HeIght="26" src="FILES/undo.gif" ALt="graphics/undo.gif"> key드 project-wide time machine that can return you to those halcyon days of last week, when the code actually compiled and ran.</p>

			<p>Source code control systems, or the more widely scoped <i>configuration management</I> systems, keep track of every change you make in your source code and documentation. The better ones can keep track of compiler and OS versions as well. With a properly configured source code control system, <I>you can always go back to a previous version of your software.</I></P>

			<p>But a source code control system (SCCS<fonT SIZe="1"><sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></sup></font>
) does far more than undo mistakes. A good SCCS will let you track changes, answering questions such as: Who made changes in this line of code? What's the difference between the current version and last week's? How many lines of code did we change in this release? Which files get changed most often? This kind of information is invaluable for bug-tracking, audit, performance, and quality purposes.</p>
<blockquote><FONT size="1">
<p ClAss="footnote">
<sUP><A NAme="FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a></sUP>
We use the uppercase SCCS to refer to generic source code control systems. There is also a specific system called "sccs," originally released with AT&amp;T System V Unix.</P>
</Font></bLOCKquotE>

				
			<P>An SCCS will also let you identify releases of your software. Once identified, you will always be able to go back and regenerate the release, independent of changes that may have occurred later.</P>

			<P>We often use an SCCS to manage branches in the development tree. For example, once you have released some software, you'll normally want to continue developing for the next release. At the same time, you'll need to deal with bugs in the current release, shipping fixed versions to clients. You'll want these bug fixes rolled into the next release (if appropriate), but you don't want to ship code under development to clients. With an SCCS you can generate branches in the development tree each time you generate a release. You apply bug fixes to code in the branch, and continue developing on the main trunk. Since the bug fixes may be relevant to the main trunk as well, some systems allow you to merge selected changes from the branch back into the main trunk automatically.</p>

			<p>Source code control systems may keep the files they maintain in a central repository드 great candidate for archiving.</p>

			<p>Finally, some products may allow two or more users to be working concurrently on the same set of files, even making concurrent changes in the same file. The system then manages the merging of these changes when the files are sent back to the repository. Although seemingly risky, such systems work well in practice on projects of all sizes.</p>

			<div class="note"><p class="notetitle"><b>Tip 23</B></P><P>

				<P>Always Use Source Code Control</p>

			</p></div>
<Br>
<Br>

			<p>Always. Even if you are a single-person team on a one-week project. Even if it's a "throw-away" prototype. Even if the stuff you're working on isn't source code. Make sure that <i>everything</I> is under source code control듟ocumentation, phone number lists, memos to vendors, makefiles, build and release procedures, that little shell script that burns the CD master든verything. We routinely use source code control on just about everything we type (including the text of this book). Even if we're not working on a project, our day-to-day work is secured in a repository.</P>

			<H4>Source Code Control and Builds</H4>
				<P>There is a tremendous hidden benefit in having an entire project under the umbrella of a source code control system: you can have product builds that are <i>automatic</i> and <i>repeatable.</i></P>

				<P>The project build mechanism can pull the latest source out of the repository automatically. It can run in the middle of the night after everyone's (hopefully) gone home. You can run automatic regression tests to ensure that the day's coding didn't break anything. The automation of the build ensures consistency듮here are no manual procedures, and you won't need developers remembering to copy code into some special build area.</P>

				<P>The build is repeatable because you can always rebuild the source as it existed on a given date.</p>
