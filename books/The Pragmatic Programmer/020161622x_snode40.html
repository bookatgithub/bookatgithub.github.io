<FONT><h3>Code Generators</h3>
			<p>When woodworkers are faced with the task of producing the same thing over and over, they cheat. They build themselves a jig or a template. If they get the jig right once, they can reproduce a piece of work time after time. The jig takes away complexity and reduces the chances of making mistakes, leaving the craftsman free to concentrate on quality.</p>

			<P>As programmers, we often find ourselves in a similar position. We need to achieve the same functionality, but in different contexts. We need to repeat information in different places. Sometimes we just need to protect ourselves from carpal tunnel syndrome by cutting down on repetitive typing.</P>

			<P>In the same way a woodworker invests the time in a jig, a programmer can build a code generator. Once built, it can be used throughout the life of the project at virtually no cost.</P>

			<p>There are two main types of code generators:</p>

			<ol type="1">
<LI>
<P><I>Passive code generators</i> are run once to produce a result. From that point forward, the result becomes freestanding—it is divorced from the code generator. The wizards discussed in <i>Evil Wizards,</i> along with some CASE tools, are examples of passive code generators.</p>
</lI>
<lI>
<p><i>Active code generators</i> are used each time their results are required. The result is a throw-away—it can always be reproduced by the code generator. Often, active code generators read some form of script or control file to produce their results.</P>

				</LI>
</OL>

			<h4>Passive Code Generators</h4>
				<p>Passive code generators save typing. They are basically parameterized templates, generating a given output from a set of inputs. Once the result is produced, it becomes a full-fledged source file in the project; it will be edited, compiled, and placed under source control just like any other file. Its origins will be forgotten.</p>

				<P>Passive code generators have many uses:</P>

				<UL>
<li><p><i>Creating new source files.</I> A passive code generator can produce templates, source code control directives, copyright notices, and standard comment blocks for each new file in a project. We have our editors set up to do this whenever we create a new file: edit a new Java program, and the new editor buffer will automatically contain a comment block, package directive, and the outline class declaration, already filled in.</P>
</LI>
<li><p><i>Performing one-off conversions</I> among programming languages. We started writing this book using the troff system, but we switched to LaTeXafter 15 sections had been completed. We wrote a code generator that read the troff source and converted it to LaTeX. It was about 90% accurate; the rest we did by hand. This is an interesting feature of passive code generators: they don't have to be totally accurate. You get to choose how much effort you put into the generator, compared with the energy you spend fixing up its output.</P>
</LI>
<li><p><i>Producing lookup tables and other resources</i> that are expensive to compute at runtime. Instead of calculating trigonometric functions, many early graphics systems used precomputed tables of sine and cosine values. Typically, these tables were produced by a passive code generator and then copied into the source.</p>

					</li>
</ul>
			
			<h4>Active Code Generators</h4>
				<p>While passive code generators are simply a convenience, their active cousins are a necessity if you want to follow the <i>DRY</i> principle. With an active code generator, you can take a single representation of some piece of knowledge and convert it into all the forms your application needs. This <i>is not</i> duplication, because the derived forms are disposable, and are generated as needed by the code generator (hence the word <i>active</i>)<i>.</I></P>

				<P>Whenever you find yourself trying to get two disparate environments to work together, you should consider using active code generators.</P>

				<p>Perhaps you're developing a database application. Here, you're dealing with two environments—the database and the programming language you are using to access it. You have a schema, and you need to define low-level structures mirroring the layout of certain database tables. You could just code these directly, but this violates the <i>DRY</i> principle: knowledge of the schema would then be expressed in two places. When the schema changes, you need to remember to change the corresponding code. If a column is removed from a table, but the code base is not changed, you might not even get a compilation error. The first you'll know about it is when your tests start failing (or when the user calls).</p>

				<p>An alternative is to use an active code generator—take the schema and use it to generate the source code for the structures, as shown in <A href="020161622x_snode40.html#4">Figure 3.3</a>. Now, whenever the schema changes, the code used to access it also changes, automatically. If a column is removed, then its corresponding field in the structure will disappear, and any higher-level code that uses that column will fail to compile. You've caught the error at compile time, not in production. Of course, this scheme works only if you make the code generation part of the build process itself.<FONT Size="1"><sUP><A Href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a></SUP></Font>

Just <i>how</i> do you go about building code from a database schema? There are several ways. If the schema is held in a flat file (for example, as <tT CLASs="monofont">create table</tt> statements), then a relatively simple script can parse it and generate the source. Alternatively, if you use a tool to create the schema directly in the database, then you should be able to extract the information you need directly from the database's data dictionary. Perl provides libraries that give you access to most major databases.</p>

				<p>Another example of melding environments using code generators happens when different programming languages are used in the same application. In order to communicate, each code base will need some information in common—data structures, message formats, and field names, for example. Rather than duplicate this information, use a code generator. Sometimes you can parse the information out of the source files of one language and use it to generate code in a second language. Often, though, it is simpler to express it in a simpler, language-neutral representation and generate the code for both languages, as shown in <a href="020161622x_snode40.html#5">Figure 3.4</A> on the following page. Also see the answer to Exercise 13 on page 286 for an example of how to separate the parsing of the flat file representation from code generation.</P>

			<h4>Code Generators Needn't Be Complex</H4>
				<p>All this talk of <i>active</i> this and <I>passive</I> that may leave you with the impression that code generators are complex beasts. They needn't be. Normally the most complex part is the parser, which analyzes the input file. Keep the input format simple, and the code generator becomes simple. Have a look at the answer to Exercise 13 (page 286): the actual code generation is basically <TT Class="monofont">print</TT> statements.</P>

			
			<H4>Code Generators Needn't Generate Code</h4>
				<p>Although many of the examples in this section show code generators that produce program source, this needn't always be the case. You can use code generators to write just about any output: HTML, XML, plain text—any text that might be an input somewhere else in your project.</p>
