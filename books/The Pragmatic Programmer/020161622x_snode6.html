<FONT><h3>What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?</h3>
			<p>Each developer is unique, with individual strengths and weaknesses, preferences and dislikes. Over time, each will craft his or her own personal environment. That environment will reflect the programmer's individuality just as forcefully as his or her hobbies, clothing, or haircut. However, if you're a Pragmatic Programmer, you'll share many of the following characteristics:</p>

			<UL>
<LI><p><b>Early adopter/fast adapter.  </b>

						You have an instinct for technologies and techniques, and you love trying things out. When given something new, you can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of your knowledge. Your confidence is born of experience.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p><b>Inquisitive.  </b>

						You tend to ask questions. <i>That's neat—how did you do that? Did you have problems with that library? What's this BeOS I've heard about? How are symbolic links implemented?</I> You are a pack rat for little facts, each of which may affect some decision years from now.</P>
</LI>
<li><p><b>Critical thinker.  </b>

						You rarely take things as given without first getting the facts. When colleagues say "because that's the way it's done," or a vendor promises the solution to all your problems, you smell a challenge.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Realistic.  </b>

						You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face. This realism gives you a good feel for how difficult things are, and how long things will take. Understanding for yourself that a process <i>should</i> be difficult or <i>will</i> take a while to complete gives you the stamina to keep at it.</p>
</li>
<LI><P><B>Jack of all trades.  </b>

						You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologies and environments, and you work to keep abreast of new developments. Although your current job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move on to new areas and new challenges.</p>

				</li>
</uL>
			<p>We've left the most basic characteristics until last. All Pragmatic Programmers share them. They're basic enough to state as tips:</P>

			<div CLASS="note"><p claSS="notetitle"><B>Tip 1</B></p><p>

				<p>Care About Your Craft</p>

			</P></DIV>
<br>
<br>

			<P>We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well.</P>

			<DIv class="note"><p class="notetitle"><b>Tip 2</b></p><p>

				<p>Think! About Your Work</p>

			</p></dIV>
<BR>
<br>

			<p>In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer, we're challenging you to think about what you're doing while you're doing it. This isn't a one-time audit of current practices—it's an ongoing critical appraisal of every decision you make, every day, and on every development. Never run on auto-pilot. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time. The old IBM corporate motto, THINK!, is the Pragmatic Programmer's mantra.</p>

			<p>If this sounds like hard work to you, then you're exhibiting the <I>realistic</i> characteristic. This is going to take up some of your valuable time—time that is probably already under tremendous pressure. The reward is a more active involvement with a job you love, a feeling of mastery over an increasing range of subjects, and pleasure in a feeling of continuous improvement. Over the long term, your time investment will be repaid as you and your team become more efficient, write code that's easier to maintain, and spend less time in meetings.</P>
