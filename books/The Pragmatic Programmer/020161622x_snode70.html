<FONT size="-1"><H3>Solving Impossible Puzzles</H3>
			<P><I>Gordius, the King of Phrygia, once tied a knot that no one could untie. It was said that he who solved the riddle of the Gordian Knot would rule all of Asia. So along comes Alexander the Great, who chops the knot to bits with his sword. Just a little different interpretation of the requirements, that's all… and he did end up ruling most of Asia.</i></p>

			<p>Every now and again, you will find yourself embroiled in the middle of a project when a really tough puzzle comes up: some piece of engineering that you just can't get a handle on, or perhaps some bit of code that is turning out to be much harder to write than you thought. Maybe it looks impossible. But is it really as hard as it seems?</p>

			<P>Consider real-world puzzles—those devious little bits of wood, wrought iron, or plastic that seem to turn up as Christmas presents or at garage sales. All you have to do is remove the ring, or fit the T-shaped pieces in the box, or whatever.</P>

			<P>So you pull on the ring, or try to put the T's in the box, and quickly discover that the obvious solutions just don't work. The puzzle can't be solved that way. But even though it's obvious, that doesn't stop people from trying the same thing—over and over—thinking there must be a way.</P>

			<p>Of course, there isn't. The solution lies elsewhere. The secret to solving the puzzle is to identify the real (not imagined) constraints, and find a solution therein. Some constraints are <i>absolute;</i> others are merely <i>preconceived notions.</I> Absolute constraints <I>must</I> be honored, however distasteful or stupid they may appear to be. On the other hand, some apparent constraints may not be real constraints at all. For example, there's that old bar trick where you take a brand new, unopened champagne bottle and bet that you can drink beer out of it. The trick is to turn the bottle upside down, and pour a small quantity of beer in the hollow in the bottom of the bottle. Many software problems can be just as sneaky.</P>

			<h4>Degrees of Freedom</h4>
				<p>The popular buzz-phrase "thinking outside the box" encourages us to recognize constraints that might not be applicable and to ignore them.</p>

				<p>But this phrase isn't entirely accurate. If the "box" is the boundary of constraints and conditions, then the trick is to <i>find</i> the box, which may be considerably larger than you think.</p>

				<p>The key to solving puzzles is both to recognize the constraints placed on you and to recognize the degrees of freedom you <i>do</i> have, for in those you'll find your solution. This is why some puzzles are so effective; you may dismiss potential solutions too readily.</p>

				<p>For example, can you connect all of the dots in the following puzzle and return to the starting point with just three straight lines—without lifting your pen from the paper or retracing your steps [<a href="020161622x_snode87.html#18">Hol78</a>]?</p>

				<BR>
<IMg bordEr="0" WidtH="50" HEIGht="50" src="FILES/puzzles.gif" ALT="graphics/puzzles.gif"><br>
				<p>You must challenge any preconceived notions and evaluate whether or not they are real, hard-and-fast constraints.</p>

				<P>It's not whether you think inside the box or outside the box. The problem lies in <I>finding</I> the box—identifying the real constraints.</P>

				<P>When faced with an intractable problem, enumerate <I>all</i> the possible avenues you have before you. Don't dismiss anything, no matter how unusable or stupid it sounds. Now go through the list and explain why a certain path cannot be taken. Are you sure? Can you <i>prove</i> it?</p>

				<p>Consider the Trojan horse—a novel solution to an intractable problem. How do you get troops into a walled city without being discovered? You can bet that "through the front door" was initially dismissed as suicide.</P>

				<p>Categorize and prioritize your constraints. When woodworkers begin a project, they cut the longest pieces first, then cut the smaller pieces out of the remaining wood. In the same manner, we want to identify the most restrictive constraints first, and fit the remaining constraints within them.</P>

				<p>By the way, a solution to the Four Posts puzzle is shown on page 307.</p>

			
			<h4>There Must Be an Easier Way!</H4>
				<P>Sometimes you will find yourself working on a problem that seems much harder than you thought it should be. Maybe it feels like you're going down the wrong path—that there must be an easier way than this! Perhaps you are running late on the schedule now, or even despair of ever getting the system to work because this particular problem is "impossible."</P>

				<P>That's when you step back a pace and ask yourself these questions:</P>

				<ul>
<li><P><I>Is</I> there an easier way?</P>
</li>
<li><P>Are you trying to solve the right problem, or have you been distracted by a peripheral technicality?</P>
</LI>
<li><p><i>Why</I> is this thing a problem?</P>
</LI>
<li><p>What is it that's making it so hard to solve?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does it have to be done this way?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does it have to be done at all?</p>

					</li>
</ul>
				<P>Many times a surprising revelation will come to you as you try to answer one of these questions. Many times a reinterpretation of the requirements can make a whole set of problems go away—just like the Gordian knot.</P>

				<P>All you need are the real constraints, the misleading constraints, and the wisdom to know the difference.</P>

			
			<h4>Challenges</h4>
				<ul>
<lI><p>Take a hard look at whatever difficult problem you are embroiled in today. Can you cut the Gordian knot? Ask yourself the key questions we outlined above, especially <I>"Does it have to be done this way?"</i></p>
</lI>
<LI><P>Were you handed a set of constraints when you signed on to your current project? Are they all still applicable, and is the interpretation of them still valid?</P>

					</li>
</ul>
