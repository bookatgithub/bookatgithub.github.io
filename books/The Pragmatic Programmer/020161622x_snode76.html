<FONT><h3>Pragmatic Teams</h3>
			<p><i>At Group L, Stoffel oversees six first-rate programmers, a managerial challenge roughly comparable to herding cats.</I></P>

			<P><B><i>The Washington Post Magazine, June 9, 1985</i></b></p>

			<P>So far in this book we've looked at pragmatic techniques that help an individual be a better programmer. Can these methods work for teams as well?</P>

			<P>The answer is a resounding "yes!" There are advantages to being a pragmatic individual, but these advantages are multiplied manyfold if the individual is working on a pragmatic team.</P>

			<p>In this section we'll look briefly at how pragmatic techniques can be applied to teams as a whole. These notes are only a start. Once you've got a group of pragmatic developers working in an enabling environment, they'll quickly develop and refine their own team dynamics that work for them.</p>

			<p>Let's recast some of the previous sections in terms of teams.</p>

			<H4>No Broken Windows</H4>
				<P>Quality is a team issue. The most diligent developer placed on a team that just doesn't care will find it difficult to maintain the enthusiasm needed to fix niggling problems. The problem is further exacerbated if the team actively discourages the developer from spending time on these fixes.</P>

				<p>Teams as a whole should not tolerate broken windows—those small imperfections that no one fixes. The team <i>must</i> take responsibility for the quality of the product, supporting developers who understand the <i>no broken windows</i> philosophy we describe in <a href="020161622x_snode14.html">Software Entropy</a>, and encouraging those who haven't yet discovered it.</p>

				<p>Some team methodologies have a <i>quality officer</i>—someone to whom the team delegates the responsibility for the quality of the deliverable. This is clearly ridiculous: quality can come only from the individual contributions of <i>all</i> team members.</p>

			
			<h4>Boiled Frogs</h4>
				<P>Remember the poor frog in the pan of water, back in <A href="020161622x_snode15.html">Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs?</a> It doesn't notice the gradual change in its environment, and ends up cooked. The same can happen to individuals who aren't vigilant. It can be difficult to keep an eye on your overall environment in the heat of project development.</p>

				<p>It's even easier for teams as a whole to get boiled. People assume that someone else is handling an issue, or that the team leader must have OK'd a change that your user is requesting. Even the best-intentioned teams can be oblivious to significant changes in their projects.</P>

				<p>Fight this. Make sure everyone actively monitors the environment for changes. Maybe appoint a <I>chief water tester.</i> Have this person check constantly for increased scope, decreased time scales, additional features, new environments—anything that wasn't in the original agreement. Keep metrics on new requirements (see page 209). The team needn't reject changes out of hand—you simply need to be aware that they're happening. Otherwise, it'll be <i>you</i> in the hot water.</P>

			
			<H4>Communicate</H4>
				<P>It's obvious that developers in a team must talk to each other. We gave some suggestions to facilitate this in <A href="020161622x_snode18.html">Communicate!</A>. However, it's easy to forget that the team itself has a presence within the organization. The team as an entity needs to communicate clearly with the rest of the world.</P>

				<P>To outsiders, the worst project teams are those that appear sullen and reticent. They hold meetings with no structure, where no one wants to talk. Their documents are a mess: no two look the same, and each uses different terminology.</P>

				<p>Great project teams have a distinct personality. People look forward to meetings with them, because they know that they'll see a well-prepared performance that makes everyone feel good. The documentation they produce is crisp, accurate, and consistent. The team speaks with one voice.<fonT SIZe="1"><sup><A HREf="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></sup></font>
  They may even have a sense of humor.</p>
<blockquote><FONT size="1">
<p ClAss="footnote">
<sUP><A NAme="FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></sUP>
The team speaks with one voice-externally. Internally, we strongly encourage lively, robust debate. Good developers tend to be passionate about their work.</P>
</Font></bLOCKquotE>

				<P>There is a simple marketing trick that helps teams communicate as one: generate a brand. When you start a project, come up with a name for it, ideally something off-the-wall. (In the past, we've named projects after things such as killer parrots that prey on sheep, optical illusions, and mythical cities.) Spend 30 minutes coming up with a zany logo, and use it on your memos and reports. Use your team's name liberally when talking with people. It sounds silly, but it gives your team an identity to build on, and the world something memorable to associate with your work.</P>

			
			<H4>Don't Repeat Yourself</h4>
				<p>In <a href="020161622x_snode22.html">The Evils of Duplication</a>, we talked about the difficulties of eliminating duplicated work between members of a team. This duplication leads to wasted effort, and can result in a maintenance nightmare. Clearly good communication can help here, but sometimes something extra is needed.</p>

				<p>Some teams appoint a member as the project librarian, responsible for coordinating documentation and code repositories. Other team members can use this person as the first port of call when they're looking for something. A good librarian will also be able to spot impending duplication by reading the material that they're handling.</p>

				<p>When the project's too big for one librarian (or when no one wants to play the role), appoint people as focal points for various functional aspects of the work. If people want to talk over date handling, they should know to talk with Mary. If there's a database schema issue, see Fred.</p>

				<p>And don't forget the value of groupware systems and local Usenet news-groups for communicating and archiving questions and answers.</p>

			
			<h4>Orthogonality</h4>
				<p>Traditional team organization is based on the old-fashioned waterfall method of software construction. Individuals are assigned roles based on their job function. You'll find business analysts, architects, designers, programmers, testers, documenters, and the like.<foNT SIze="1"><sup><A hRef="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></SUP></FOnt>
 There is an implicit hierarchy here—the closer to the user you're allowed, the more senior you are.</p>
<bLOCKquotE><FONt sizE="1">
<P CLass="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></sup>
In <i>The Rational Unified Process: An Introduction,</i> the author identifies 27 separate roles within a project team! [<a href="020161622x_snode87.html#25">Kru98</A>]</P>
</font></bLoCkquOTE>

					
				<P>Taking things to the extreme, some development cultures dictate strict divisions of responsibility; coders aren't allowed to talk to testers, who in turn aren't allowed to talk to the chief architect, and so on. Some organizations then compound the problem by having different sub-teams report through separate management chains.</P>

				<p>It is a mistake to think that the activities of a project—analysis, design, coding, and testing—can happen in isolation. They can't. These are different views of the same problem, and artificially separating them can cause a boatload of trouble. Programmers who are two or three levels removed from the actual users of their code are unlikely to be aware of the context in which their work is used. They will not be able to make informed decisions.</p>

				<diV CLAss="note"><p cLASS="notetitle"><b>Tip 60</b></p><p>

					<P>Organize Around Functionality, Not Job Functions</P>

				</P></Div>
<br>
<br>

				<p>We favor splitting teams functionally. Divide your people into small teams, each responsible for a particular functional aspect of the final system. Let the teams organize themselves internally, building on individual strengths as they can. Each team has responsibilities to others in the project, as defined by their agreed-upon commitments. The exact set of commitments changes with each project, as does the allocation of people into teams.</p>

				<p>Functionality here does not necessarily mean end-user use cases. The database access layer counts, as does the help subsystem. We're looking for cohesive, largely self-contained teams of people—exactly the same criteria we should be using when we modularize code. There are warning signs that the team organization is wrong—a classic example is having two subteams working on the same program module or class.</p>

				<p>How does this functional style of organization help? Organize our resources using the same techniques we use to organize code, using techniques such as contracts (<a href="020161622x_snode43.html">Design by Contract</a>), decoupling (<a href="020161622x_snode55.html">Decoupling and the Law of Demeter</A>), and orthogonality (<A href="020161622x_snode23.html">Orthogonality</a>), and we help isolate the team as a whole from the effects of change. If the user suddenly decides to change database vendors, only the database team should be affected. Should marketing suddenly decide to use an off-the-shelf tool for the calendar function, the calendar group takes a hit. Properly executed, this kind of group approach can dramatically reduce the number of interactions between individuals' work, reducing time scales, increasing quality, and cutting down on the number of defects. This approach can also lead to a more committed set of developers. Each team knows that they alone are responsible for a particular function, so they feel more ownership of their output.</P>

				<p>However, this approach works only with responsible developers and strong project management. Creating a pool of autonomous teams and letting them loose without leadership is a recipe for disaster. The project needs at least two "heads"—one technical, the other administrative. The technical head sets the development philosophy and style, assigns responsibilities to teams, and arbitrates the inevitable "discussions" between people. The technical head also looks constantly at the big picture, trying to find any unnecessary commonality between teams that could reduce the orthogonality of the overall effort. The administrative head, or project manager, schedules the resources that the teams need, monitors and reports on progress, and helps decide priorities in terms of business needs. The administrative head might also act as the team's ambassador when communicating with the outside world.</P>

				<p>Teams on larger projects need additional resources: a librarian who indexes and stores code and documentation, a tool builder who provides common tools and environments, operational support, and so on.</p>

				<p>This type of team organization is similar in spirit to the old chief programmer team concept, first documented in 1972 [<A href="020161622x_snode87.html#1">Bak72</a>].</p>

			
			<h4>Automation</h4>
				<P>A great way to ensure both consistency and accuracy is to automate everything the team does. Why lay code out manually when your editor can do it automatically as you type? Why complete test forms when the overnight build can run tests automatically?</P>

				<P>Automation is an essential component of every project team—important enough for us to dedicate an entire section to it, starting on the following page. To ensure that things get automated, appoint one or more team members as <I>tool builders</i> to construct and deploy the tools that automate the project drudgery. Have them produce makefiles, shell scripts, editor templates, utility programs, and the like.</p>

			
			<h4>Know When to Stop Adding Paint</h4>
				<P>Remember that teams are made up of individuals. Give each member the ability to shine in his or her own way. Give them just enough structure to support them and to ensure that the project delivers against its requirements. Then, like the painter in <A href="020161622x_snode16.html">Good-Enough Software</a>, resist the temptation to add more paint.</p>
