			<p>Typically, developers don't give much thought to documentation. At best it is an unfortunate necessity; at worst it is treated as a low-priority task in the hope that management will forget about it at the end of the project.</p>

			<P>Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process. Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself, if possible.</P>

			<P>These aren't exactly original or novel thoughts; the idea of wedding code and documentation appears in Donald Knuth's work on literate programming and in Sun's JavaDoc utility, among others. We want to downplay the dichotomy between code and documentation, and instead treat them as two views of the same model (see <A href="020161622x_snode58.html">It's Just a View</A>). In fact, we want to go a little further and apply <I>all</I> of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to code.</P>

				<p>Treat English as Just Another Programming Language</p>

			</P></DIV>
<br>
<br>

			<p>There are basically two kinds of documentation produced for a project: internal and external. Internal documentation includes source code comments, design and test documents, and so on. External documentation is anything shipped or published to the outside world, such as user manuals. But regardless of the intended audience, or the role of the writer (developer or technical writer), all documentation is a mirror of the code. If there's a discrepancy, the code is what matters—for better or worse.</P>

			<dIv clASS="note"><P Class="notetitle"><B>Tip 68</B></P><P>

				<p>Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On</p>

			</p></dIV>
<BR>
<br>

			<p>We'll start with internal documentation.</p>

			<H4>Comments in Code</H4>
				<P>Producing formatted documents from the comments and declarations in source code is fairly straightforward, but first we have to ensure that we actually <I>have</i> comments in the code. Code should have comments, but too many comments can be just as bad as too few.</p>

				<p>In general, comments should discuss <i>why</i> something is done, its purpose and its goal. The code already shows <i>how</i> it is done, so commenting on this is redundant—and is a violation of the <i>DRY</i> principle.</p>

				<p>Commenting source code gives you the perfect opportunity to document those elusive bits of a project that can't be documented anywhere else: engineering trade-offs, why decisions were made, what other alternatives were discarded, and so on.</p>

				<p>We like to see a <i>simple</i> module-level header comment, comments for significant data and type declarations, and a brief per-class and per-method header, describing how the function is used and anything that it does that is not obvious.</p>

				<p>Variable names, of course, should be well chosen and meaningful. <tt cLASS="monofont">foo,</tt> for instance, is meaningless, as is <tt cLaSs="monofont">doit</tt> or <TT CLAss="monofont">manager</tt> or <TT CLass="monofont">stuff.</tT> Hungarian notation (where you encode the variable's type information in the name itself) is utterly inappropriate in object-oriented systems. Remember that you (and others after you) will be <I>reading</I> the code many hundreds of times, but only <I>writing</i> it a few times. Take the time to spell out <tt cLASS="monofont">connectionPool</tt> instead of <tt class="monofont">cp.</tt></p>

				<p>Even worse than meaningless names are <i>misleading</i> names. Have you ever had someone explain inconsistencies in legacy code such as, "The routine called <tt claSS="monofont">getData</TT> really writes data to disk"? The human brain will repeatedly foul this up—it's called the <i>Stroop Effect</i> [<a href="020161622x_snode87.html#42">Str35</A>]. You can try the following experiment yourself to see the effects of such interference. Get some colored pens, and use them to write down the names of colors. However, never write a color name using that color pen. You could write the word "blue" in green, the word "brown" in red, and so on. (Alternatively, we have a sample set of colors already drawn on our Web site at <a taRGET="_blank" Href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/default.htm">http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com</a>.) Once you have the color names drawn, try to say aloud the color with which each word is drawn, as fast as you can. At some point you'll trip up and start reading the names of the colors, and not the colors themselves. Names are deeply meaningful to your brain, and misleading names add chaos to your code.</P>

				<P>You can document parameters, but ask yourself if it is really necessary in all cases. The level of comment suggested by the JavaDoc tool seems appropriate:</P>

				<Pre>
					
    /**
      * <i>Find the peak (highest) value within a specified date</i>
      * <I>range of samples.</I>
      *
      * <I>@param  aRange Range of dates to search for data.</I>
      * <i>@param  aThreshold Minimum value to consider.</i>
      * <i>@return the value, or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if no value found</i>
                <I>greater than or equal to the threshold.</I>
      */
      <B>public</B> Sample findPeak(DateRange aRange, <b>double</b> aThreshold);
</pre>

				<p>Here's a list of things that should not appear in source comments.</p>

				<ul>
<li><p><b>A list of the functions exported by code in the file.  </b>

							There are programs that analyze source for you. Use them, and the list is guaranteed to be up to date.</p>
</li>
<li><p><B>Revision history.  </B>

							This is what source code control systems are for (see <A href="020161622x_snode34.html">Source Code Control</a>). However, it can be useful to include information on the date of last change and the person who made it.<fOnT sizE="1"><SUP><A href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</A></SUP></font>
<BLOCkquoTE><FOnt size="1">
<p class="footnote">
<sup><a name="FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</A></SUP>
This kind of information, as well as the filename, is provided by the RCS <tt claSs="monofont">$Id$</Tt> tag.</p>
</fONT></BLockqUOTE>

								</p>
</li>
<lI><P><B>A list of other files this file uses.  </B>

							This can be determined more accurately using automatic tools.</p>
</li>
<lI><P><B>The name of the file.  </B>

							If it must appear in the file, don't maintain it by hand. RCS and similar systems can keep this information up to date automatically. If you move or rename the file, you don't want to have to remember to edit the header.</p>

					</li>
</ul>
				<p>One of the most important pieces of information that <i>should</i> appear in the source file is the author's name—not necessarily who edited the file last, but the owner. Attaching responsibility and accountability to source code does wonders in keeping people honest (see <a href="020161622x_snode81.html">Pride and Prejudice</a>).</p>

				<p>The project may also require certain copyright notices or other legal boilerplate to appear in each source file. Get your editor to insert these for you automatically.</p>

				<p>With meaningful comments in place, tools such as JavaDoc [<a href="020161622x_snode86.html#11">URL 7</A>] and DOC++ [<a href="020161622x_snode86.html#25">URL 21</A>] can extract and format them to automatically produce API-level documentation. This is one specific example of a more general technique we use—<i>executable documents.</I></p>

			
			<h4>Executable Documents</h4>
				<P>Suppose we have a specification that lists the columns in a database table. We'll then have a separate set of SQL commands to create the actual table in the database, and probably some kind of programming language record structure to hold the contents of a row in the table. The same information is repeated three times. Change any one of these three sources, and the other two are immediately out of date. This is a clear violation of the <I>DRY</I> principle.</P>

				<P>To correct this problem, we need to choose the authoritative source of information. This may be the specification, it may be a database schema tool, or it may be some third source altogether. Let's choose the specification document as the source. It's now our <i>model</i> for this process. We then need to find a way to export the information it contains as different <i>views</i>—a database schema and a high-level language record, for example.<FONT size="1"><SUP><A href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</A></SUP></font>
</p>
<blockquote><font sIZE="1">
<P class="footnote">
<SuP><a naME="FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</A></SUp>
See <a href="020161622x_snode58.html">It's Just a View</A>, for more on models and views.</P>
</font></BLOCkquoTE>

					
				<P>If your document is stored as plain text with markup commands (using HTML, LaTeX, or troff, for example), then you can use tools such as Perl to extract the schema and reformat it automatically. If your document is in a word processor's binary format, then see the box on the following page for some options.</P>

				<p>Your document is now an integral part of the project development. The only way to change the schema is to change the document. You are guaranteeing that the specification, schema, and code all agree. You minimize the amount of work you have to do for each change, and you can update the views of the change automatically.</p>

				<p><table cellspacing="0" wIDTH="90%" bordeR="1"><tR><td><cENTER><h2>
What if My Document Isn't Plain Text?</h2></ceNTER>
					<p>Unfortunately, more and more project documents are now being written using world processors that store the file on disk in some proprietary format. We say "unfortunately" because this severely restricts your options to process the document automatically. However, you still have a couple of options:</p>

					<ul>
<LI><P><B>Write macros.  </b>

								Most sophisticated word processors now have a macro language. With some effort you can program them to export tagged sections of your documents into the alternative forms you need. If programming at this level is too painful, you could always export the appropriate section into a standard format plain text file, and then use a tool such as Perl to convert this into the final forms.</p>
</li>
<LI><P><B>Make the document subordinate.  </b>

								Rather than have the document as the definitive source, use another representation. (In the database example, you might want to use the schema as the authoritative information.) Then write a tool that exports this information into a form that the document can import. Be careful, however. You need to ensure that this information is imported every time the document is printed, rather than just once when the document is created.</p>

						</li>
</ul>
				</td></tr></table></p>

				<p>We can generate API-level documentation from source code using tools such as JavaDoc and DOC++ in a similar fashion. The model is the source code: one view of the model can be compiled; other views are meant to be printed out or viewed on the Web. Our goal is always to work on the model—whether the model is the code itself or some other document—and have all views updated automatically (see <a href="020161622x_snode77.html">Ubiquitous Automation</A>, for more on automatic processes).</P>

				<p>Suddenly, documentation isn't so bad.</p>

			
			<h4>Technical Writers</h4>
				<p>Up until now, we've talked only about internal documentation—written by the programmers themselves. But what happens when you have professional technical writers involved in the project? All too often, programmers just throw material "over the wall" to technical writers and let them fend for themselves to produce user manuals, promotional pieces, and so on.</P>

				<p>This is a mistake. Just because programmers aren't writing these documents doesn't mean that we can forsake pragmatic principles. We want the writers to embrace the same basic principles that a Pragmatic Programmer does—especially honoring the <I>DRY</i> principle, orthogonality, the model-view concept, and the use of automation and scripting.</p>

			
			<h4>Print It or Weave It</H4>
				<P>One problem inherent with published, paper documentation is that it can become out of date as soon as it's printed. Documentation of any form is just a snapshot.</P>

				<P>So we try to produce all documentation in a form that can be published online, on the Web, complete with hyperlinks. It's easier to keep this view of the documentation up to date than to track down every existing paper copy, burn it, and reprint and redistribute new copies. It's also a better way to address the needs of a wide audience. Remember, though, to put a date stamp or version number on each Web page. This way the reader can get a good idea of what's up to date, what's changed recently, and what hasn't.</P>

				<p>Many times you need to present the same documentation in different formats: a printed document, Web pages, online help, or perhaps a slide show. The typical solution relies heavily on cut-and-paste, creating a number of new independent documents from the original. This is a bad idea: a document's presentation should be independent of its content.</p>

				<p>If you are using a markup system, you have the flexibility to implement as many different output formats as you need. You can choose to have</p>

				<PRE>
					
    &lt;H1&gt;<I>Chapter Title</i>&lt;/H1&gt;
</pre>

				<P>generate a new chapter in the report version of the document and title a new slide in the slide show. Technologies such as XSL and CSS<FONt sizE="1"><SUP><a href="#FOOTNOTE-11">[11]</a></sup></font>
 can be used to generate multiple output formats from this one markup.</p>
<blockqUOTE><font sIzE="1">
<p clASS="footnote">
<SUp><a naME="FOOTNOTE-11">[11]</A></Sup>
eXtensible Style Language and Cascading Style Sheets, two technologies designed to help separate presentation from content.</p>
</fONT></BlockQUOTe>

					
				<p>If you are using a word processor, you'll probably have similar capabilities. If you remembered to use styles to identify different document elements, then by applying different style sheets you can drastically alter the look of the final output. Most word processors now allow you to convert your document to formats such as HTML for Web publishing.</p>

			
			<h4>Markup Languages</h4>
				<p>Finally, for large-scale documentation projects, we recommend looking at some of the more modern schemes for marking up documentation.</p>

				<p>Many technical authors now use DocBook to define their documents. DocBook is an SGML-based markup standard that carefully identifies every component in a document. The document can be passed through a DSSSL processor to render it into any number of different formats. The Linux documentation project uses DocBook to publish information in RTF, <img border="0" widTH="50" HEight="28" src="FILES/tex.gif" Alt="graphics/tex.gif">, info, PostScript, and HTML formats.</p>

				<P>As long as your original markup is rich enough to express all the concepts you need (including hyperlinks), translation to any other pub-lishable form can be both easy and automatic. You can produce online help, published manuals, product highlights for the Web site, and even a tip-a-day calendar, all from the same source—which of course is under source control and is built along with the nightly build (see <A href="020161622x_snode77.html">Ubiquitous Automation</a>).</p>

				<p>Documentation and code are different views of the same underlying model, but the view is <I>all</I> that should be different. Don't let documentation become a second-class citizen, banished from the main project workflow. Treat documentation with the same care you treat code, and the users (and maintainers who follow) will sing your praises.</P>
