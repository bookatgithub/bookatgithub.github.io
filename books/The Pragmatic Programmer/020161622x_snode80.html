<FONT><h3>Great Expectations</h3>
			<p><i>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid…</I></P>

			<P><B>Jeremiah 2:12</b></p>

			<p>A company announces record profits, and its share price drops 20%. The financial news that night explains that the company failed to meet analysts' expectations. A child opens an expensive Christmas present and bursts into tears—it wasn't the cheap doll the child was hoping for. A project team works miracles to implement a phenomenally complex application, only to have it shunned by its users because it doesn't have a help system.</p>

			<P>In an abstract sense, an application is successful if it correctly implements its specifications. Unfortunately, this pays only abstract bills.</P>

			<P>In reality, the success of a project is measured by how well it meets the <I>expectations</i> of its users. A project that falls below their expectations is deemed a failure, no matter how good the deliverable is in absolute terms. However, like the parent of the child expecting the cheap doll, go too far and you'll be a failure, too.</p>

			<diV CLAss="note"><p class="notetitle"><b>Tip 69</b></p><p>

				<p>Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations</p>

			</p></div>
<br>
<BR>

			<P>However, the execution of this tip requires some work.</P>

			<h4>Communicating Expectations</h4>
				<p>Users initially come to you with some vision of what they want. It may be incomplete, inconsistent, or technically impossible, but it is <i>theirs,</i> and, like the child at Christmas, they have some emotion invested in it. You cannot just ignore it.</P>

				<p>As your understanding of their needs develops, you'll find areas where their expectations cannot be met, or where their expectations are perhaps too conservative. Part of your role is to communicate this. Work with your users so that their understanding of what you'll be delivering is accurate. And do this throughout the development process. Never lose sight of the business problems your application is intended to solve.</P>

				<p>Some consultants call this process "managing expectations"—actively controlling what users should hope to get from their systems. We think this is a somewhat elitist position. Our role is not to control the hopes of our users. Instead, we need to work with them to come to a common understanding of the development process and the final deliverable, along with those expectations they have not yet verbalized. If the team is communicating fluently with the outside world, this process is almost automatic; everyone should understand what's expected and how it will be built.</p>

				<p>There are some important techniques that can be used to facilitate this process. Of these, <A href="020161622x_snode25.html">Tracer Bullets</a>, and <a href="020161622x_snode26.html">Prototypes and Post-it Notes</A>, are the most important. Both let the team construct something that the user can see. Both are ideal ways of communicating your understanding of their requirements. And both let you and your users practice communicating with each other.</P>

			
			<h4>The Extra Mile</h4>
				<p>If you work closely with your users, sharing their expectations and communicating what you're doing, then there will be few surprises when the project gets delivered.</p>

				<P>This is a <TT Class="monofont">BAD THING.</TT> Try to surprise your users. Not scare them, mind you, but <I>delight</I> them.</p>

				<p>Give them that little bit more than they were expecting. The extra bit of effort it requires to add some user-oriented feature to the system will pay for itself time and time again in goodwill.</p>

				<p>Listen to your users as the project progresses for clues about what features would really delight them. Some things you can add relatively easily that look good to the average user include:</p>

				<ul>
<li><p>Balloon or ToolTip help</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keyboard shortcuts</p>
</li>
<lI><P>A quick reference guide as a supplement to the user's manual</P>
</Li>
<li><p>Colorization</p>
</Li>
<Li><p>Log file analyzers</p>
</LI>
<LI><P>Automated installation</p>
</li>
<lI><P>Tools for checking the integrity of the system</P>
</Li>
<li><p>The ability to run multiple versions of the system for training</P>
</LI>
<Li><p>A splash screen customized for their organization</p>

					</lI>
</UL>
				<P>All of these things are relatively superficial, and don't really overburden the system with feature bloat. However, each tells your users that the development team cared about producing a great system, one that was intended for real use. Just remember not to break the system adding these new features.</p>
