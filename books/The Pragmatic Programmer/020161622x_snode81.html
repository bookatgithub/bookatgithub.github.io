<FONT><h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
			<p><i>You have delighted us long enough.</I></P>

			<P><B>Jane Austen, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i></b></p>

			<P>Pragmatic Programmers don't shirk from responsibility. Instead, we rejoice in accepting challenges and in making our expertise well known. If we are responsible for a design, or a piece of code, we do a job we can be proud of.</P>

			<DIv claSS="note"><P Class="notetitle"><b>Tip 70</b></p><p>

				<p>Sign Your Work</p>

			</p></div>
<br>
<br>

			<p>Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too.</p>

			<P>Project teams are still made up of people, however, and this rule can cause trouble. On some projects, the idea of <I>code ownership</I> can cause cooperation problems. People may become territorial, or unwilling to work on common foundation elements. The project may end up like a bunch of insular little fiefdoms. You become prejudiced in favor of your code and against your coworkers.</P>

			<p>That's not what we want. You shouldn't jealously defend your code against interlopers; by the same token, you should treat other people's code with respect. The Golden Rule ("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you") and a foundation of mutual respect among the developers is critical to make this tip work.</p>

			<p>Anonymity, especially on large projects, can provide a breeding ground for sloppiness, mistakes, sloth, and bad code. It becomes too easy to see yourself as just a cog in the wheel, producing lame excuses in endless status reports instead of good code.</p>

			<p>While code must be owned, it doesn't have to be owned by an individual. In fact, Kent Beck's successful eXtreme Programming method [<A href="020161622x_snode86.html#53">URL 45</a>] recommends communal ownership of code (but this also requires additional practices, such as pair programming, to guard against the dangers of anonymity).</P>

			<P>We want to see pride of ownership. "I wrote this, and I stand behind my work." Your signature should come to be recognized as an indicator of quality. People should see your name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well written, tested, and documented. A really professional job. Written by a real professional.</P>

			<P>A Pragmatic Programmer.</P>
