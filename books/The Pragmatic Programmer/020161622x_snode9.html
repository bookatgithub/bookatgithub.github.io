<FONT><h3>How the Book Is Organized</h3>
			<p>This book is written as a collection of short sections. Each section is self-contained, and addresses a particular topic. You'll find numerous cross references, which help put each topic in context. Feel free to read the sections in any order—this isn't a book you need to read front-to-back.</p>

			<P>Occasionally you'll come across a box labeled <I>Tip nn</I> (such as Tip 1, "Care About Your Craft" on page xix). As well as emphasizing points in the text, we feel the tips have a life of their own—we live by them daily. You'll find a summary of all the tips on a pull-out card inside the back cover.</P>

			<p><a href="020161622x_cnode82.html">Appendix A</A> contains a set of resources: the book's bibliography, a list of URLs to Web resources, and a list of recommended periodicals, books, and professional organizations. Throughout the book you'll find references to the bibliography and to the list of URLs—such as [<A href="020161622x_snode87.html#24">KP99</A>] and [URL 18], respectively.</P>

			<P>We've included exercises and challenges where appropriate. Exercises normally have relatively straightforward answers, while the challenges are more open-ended. To give you an idea of our thinking, we've included our answers to the exercises in <A href="020161622x_cnode88.html">Appendix B</a>, but very few have a single <i>correct</i> solution. The challenges might form the basis of group discussions or essay work in advanced programming courses.</p>
