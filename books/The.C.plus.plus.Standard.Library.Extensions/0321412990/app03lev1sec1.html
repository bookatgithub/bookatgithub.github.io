<h3 id="title-IDA5WJQF" class="docSection1Title">C.1. Problems</h3>
<p class="docText">When writing a multithreaded application, you have to think about two problems: avoiding conflicting changes to shared data and making sure that changes to shared data are visible to other threads. Most programmers are familiar with the first of these; the second is becoming more important as we move to hardware systems with multiple CPUs.</p>
<p class="docText">If two threads are changing the same data object at the same time, the result will likely be a nonviable hybrid, with some parts from one thread and other parts from the other thread. To prevent this from happening, you have to make sure that all the changes made by one thread have been written to the data object before the other thread makes any changes. You do this by locking a <span class="docEmphasis">mutex</span> object; when a thread tries to lock a mutex object that is already locked, the execution of that thread is suspended until the thread that locked the mutex object unlocks it. This serializes access to the shared data object, giving each of the threads a coherent view of the contents of the object.</p>
<p class="docText">In a hardware system with multiple CPUs, all of them usually share most <a name="iddle1678"></a>or all of the system's main memory, and each CPU has its own private cache memory. Each CPU reads data from and writes data to its cache; this speeds up the CPU's work because the CPU doesn't have to contend with other CPUs for access to main memory. However, because the CPU is working with its cache instead of main memory, it might not see changes that other CPUs have made to the contents of main memory, and changes made by it might not have made it out to main memory, so won't be seen by other CPUs. So from time to time, each CPU has to synchronize the data in its cache with the corresponding data in main memory: Any data that has been written to the cache has to be flushed to main memory, and any data that another CPU has changed in main memory has to be refreshed in the cache.</p>
<p class="docText">On most systems, changes made to a shared object before creation of a thread are visible to code in that thread. At the other end, when a thread terminates, any changes made to a shared object by that thread are visible to any thread that checks the status of the terminated threadby, for example, calling <tt>pthread_join</tt> on POSIX systems. In between, after a thread unlocks a mutex, all changes to global data made by that thread are visible to any other thread that subsequently locks the mutex:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>int g1 =  0;
int g2 =  0;

<span class="docEmphasis">// thread 1</span>                        <span class="docEmphasis">// thread 2</span>
g1 = 1;                            // ...
start_thread2 ();                  assert (g1 == 1);     <span class="docEmphasis">// 1</span>
lock_mutex ();                     lock_mutex ();
unlock_mutex ();                   g1 =  2;
assert (g1 == 2);     <span class="docEmphasis">// 2</span>         unlock_mutex ();
wait_for_thread2 ();               g2 =  3;
assert (g2 == 3);     <span class="docEmphasis">// 3</span>         exit_thread ();
</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">In the preceding code, <tt>assert</tt> number 1 will always succeed. The change made to <tt>g1</tt> by thread 1 is visible to thread 2 because thread 1 created thread 2 after it changed <tt>g1</tt>. Also, <tt>assert</tt> number 3 will always succeed. Thread 2 set the value of <tt>g2</tt> to 3 before it terminated, and thread 1 waited until thread 2 terminated before taking its final look at the value of <tt>g2</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText">The second <tt>assert</tt> is more complicated. If thread 2 locked the mutex before thread 1 did, the <tt>assert</tt> will succeed. In that case, thread 2 made the change before unlocking the mutex, so the change will be visible to threads that subsequently lock the mutex. On the other hand, if thread 1 locked the mutex before thread 2 did, there's no way to know what will happen. There is no guarantee that the change made by thread 2 will be visible, but there is also no guarantee that it won't. So thread 1 could see either 1 or 2 in <tt>g1</tt>. But it's <a name="iddle1477"></a><a name="iddle1525"></a>worse than that: It's possible that a thread switch could occur while thread 2 is writing the new value to <tt>g1</tt>, creating a nonviable hybrid. This is a <span class="docEmphasis">race condition</span>: The validity and the result of the code depend, in unpredictable ways, on the timing of the execution of the code in the two threads.</p>
