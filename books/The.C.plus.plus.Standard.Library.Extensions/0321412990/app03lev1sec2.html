<h3 id="title-IDALFJLF" class="docSection1Title">C.2. Libraries and Multithreading</h3>
<p class="docText">If you think about it, it should become clear that a library cannot solve these multithreading problems. Ensuring that accesses to shared data are properly synchronized requires that an application be designed with thread safety in mind. For example:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>void show ()
  {
  std :: cout &lt;&lt; " hello, " &lt;&lt; " world \n";
  }
</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">The two insertion operations are separate functions. The implementation of the stream inserter can protect <tt>cout</tt>'s internal data from conflicting writes, but if <tt>show</tt> is called from multiple threads, there is nothing the implementation can reasonably do to prevent a thread switch between the two insertions. The output of such a program could have multiple <tt>hello</tt>s and multiple <tt>world</tt>s instead of the orderly sequence of lines that the programmer might have expected. To maintain the proper order, the application must guard all stream insertions:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>void show ()
  {
  mutex lock ; <span class="docEmphasis">// constructor locks, destructor unlocks</span>
  std :: cout &lt;&lt; " hello, " &lt;&lt; " world \n";
  }
</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">However, library writers should avoid making things more difficult for application designers concerned with writing fast and robust multithreaded applications. As we saw earlier, applying visibility rules requires knowing when the contents of a shared data object have been changed. A good library implementation will change the contents of a shared data object only when a program explicitly changes that object.</p>
<p class="docText">That may seem obvious, but sneak paths often modify objects behind the scenes. For example, at one time or another, you've probably written code to count the number of objects of a particular type that are in existence: You add a static data member to hold the count, and then each constructor increments the count, and each destructor decrements it. This seems innocuous, but if you <a name="iddle1679"></a>create two of these objects in two separate threads, you may find that neither one has the correct count; the static counter is shared data, and without synchronization, there is no guarantee that changes made by either thread will be visible to the other.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#app03fn1">[1]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="app03fn1">[1]</a></sup> This problem is also discussed in <a class="docLink" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Most library implementations make the following promises.</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Multiple threads can read data from the same object without interference</p></li><LI><p class="docList">Changes to one object do not affect other objects of the same type.</p></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">Keeping these promises in mind, you can write robust multithreaded applications by applying the visibility and locking rules that we just talked about. Using objects from the standard C++ library and the TR1 library won't introduce additional problems.</p>
