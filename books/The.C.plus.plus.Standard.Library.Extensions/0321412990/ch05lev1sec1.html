<h3 id="title-IDAJHKQF" class="docSection1Title">5.1. Standardizing Hash Tables</H3>
<p class="docText">One of the most commonly requested additions to the standard C++ library is hash tables. Properly used, they can provide significant speed improvements <a name="iddle1347"></a>in searches. A 1995 proposal to add STL-style hash tables to the standard library was rejected because the target date for completion of the standard did not leave enough time for proper evaluation and adaptation of the proposed changes. Now that there's time, the TR1 library provides hash tables, under the names <tt>unordered_map</tt>, <tt>unordered_multimap</tt>, <tt>unordered_set</tt>, and <tt>unordered_multiset</tt>.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#ch05fn2">[2]</a></sup> These template classes are defined in the headers <tt>&lt;unordered_map&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;unordered_set&gt;</tt>. In addition to these four containers, the TR1 library provides a template class named <tt>hash</tt> that provides the default hash functions for these containers.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="ch05fn2">[2]</a></sup> The more obvious names, <tt>hash_map</tt>, and so on, were rejected because they are already widely used for hash tables that are somewhat different from the hashed containers in TR1.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">These containers don't quite fit into the existing set of container requirements, so TR1 provides a new set of requirements for what it formally refers to as &quot;unordered associative containers.&quot; Don't let the name confuse you: Their requirements are slightly different from the requirements for associative containers, so the two kinds aren't quite interchangeable. We'll look at their differences in more detail a little later.</P>
<p class="docText">One of the biggest problems in designing a generic interface to a hash table is choosing the right set of parameters for tuning the operation of the resulting objects. With too few parameters, the template is too inflexible for broad use. With too many, it's too flexible, and it becomes difficult to know what it's really doing. TR1's unordered containers can be tuned at compile time by selecting suitable type arguments for hashing data values and for comparing data values for equality. They can be tuned at runtime by setting the maximum allowable load factor, which determines how many objects can be inserted in the container without forcing it to reshuffle them into more buckets, and by calling the member function <tt>rehash</tt>, which forces that reshuffling.</p>
