<p class="docText">Some hardware architectures impose <span class="docEmphasis">alignment</span> constraints, requiring that objects of certain types have addresses whose value is a multiple of some small number. In some cases, this is an absolute requirement: Attempting to access data that is not properly aligned causes a hardware fault. In others, it affects program performance: Attempting to access data that is not properly aligned requires additional bus cycles, slowing reading and writing of that data. Since alignment restrictions are imposed by hardware, the small number that defines the required alignment is usually a power of 2: typically, 4, 8, or 16. When we talk about the required alignment for some type, we usually say that it requires, for example, 8-byte alignment. This means that its address must be a multiple of 8.</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>template &lt;class Ty&gt; struct alignment_of;
template &lt;std::size_t Len, std::size_t Align&gt;
  struct aligned_storage;
</pre></div><br>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">The template specialization <tt>alignment_of&lt;Ty&gt;</tt> is derived from <tt>integral_constant&lt;std::size_t, Align&gt;</tt>, where <tt>Align</tt> is the alignment of objects of type <tt>Ty</tt>.</P>
<p class="docText">The argument <tt>Ty</tt> to the class template <tt>alignment_of&lt;Ty&gt;</tt> must name a complete type.</p>
<p class="docText">The template specialization <tt>aligned_storage&lt; Len, Align &gt;</tt> holds a nested type named <tt>type</tt> that names a POD type that can be used as uninitialized storage for an object whose alignment is a divisor of <tt>Align</tt> and whose size is less than or equal to <tt>Len</tt>. The value of the template argument <tt>Align</tt> must be the same as <tt>alignment_of&lt;Ty&gt;::value</tt> for some type <tt>Ty</tt>.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#ch11fn7">[7]</a></sup></P>
<blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="ch11fn7">[7]</a></sup> This means, in part, that <tt>aligned_storage</tt> cannot be used to create a typical DMA buffer, which usually must be aligned on a boundary that's a multiple of a fairly large number, such as 16K.</P></blockquote></blockquote>
<p class="docText">The primary problem that these templates address is the need to create a properly aligned static storage block to use with placement <tt>new</tt>. This code doesn't necessarily work correctly:</P>
<div class="docText"><pre>unsigned char data [ sizeof (double)];
double * loc = new (( void *)&amp; data ) double ;
* loc = 1.0;
</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">The problem here is that the array <tt>data</tt> can usually be aligned at a 1-byte boundarythat is, anywhere in memorywhereas the <tt>double*</tt> returned by placement <tt>new</tt> must point to memory that is properly aligned for an object of type <tt>double</tt>, which often requires a 4-byte or 8-byte boundary. The usual solution to this problem is to use a union of eight to ten fundamental types, in the hope that one of them will require the target platform's worst-case alignment; a data array that can hold an object of that type will then be able to hold any data type. This approach has two drawbacks. First, alignment requirements for some types may be more severe than those of the types included in the union. In that case, those types will probably not be suitably aligned. Second, this approach wastes space for types whose alignment requirements are less severe than the worst case provided by the union. The solution using the TR1 alignment templates looks like this:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>aligned_storage &lt; sizeof ( double ),
  alignment_of &lt;double&gt;:: value&gt;:: type data ;
double * loc = new ((void *)&amp; data) double;
* loc = 1.0;
</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">The definition of <tt>data</tt> in that code is a bit daunting, so let's look at it piece by piece. First, <tt>sizeof(double)</tt> is the number of bytes needed to represent a value of type <tt>double</tt>. Second, <tt>alignment_of&lt;double&gt;::value</tt> is the required alignment for a value of type <tt>double</tt>. Those two values are passed as the template arguments <tt>Len</tt> and <tt>Align</tt> to the class template <tt>aligned_-storage</tt>. The resulting template instantiation has a nested type named <tt>type</tt> that has the required size and alignment. By defining <tt>data</tt> to be an object of that type, we guarantee that <tt>data</tt> has the required size and alignment. Since that type is a POD, it has a trivial destructor, so running a destructor on data that doesn't make sense won't cause any problems.</p>
