<p class="docText">Powerful software facilities, too, are often made of a multitude of fibers. The <tt>&lt;regex&gt;</tt> header offers a somewhat daunting set of class templates and function templates for searches using regular expressions. Don't let the size of the header deter you, though; you need to understand only a few basic ideas to use regular expressions effectively. You need to know how to write a regular expression (<a class="docLink" href="ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>), how to create an object that holds a regular expression (<a class="docLink" href="ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a>), how to use a regular expression object to search for matches in a target string (<a class="docLink" href="ch17.html#ch17">Chapter 17</a>), and how to hold the results of a search (<a class="docLink" href="ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a>). For more sophisticated applications you can create iterator objects that perform multiple sequential searches (<a class="docLink" href="ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>), suitable for use as input sequences to STL algorithms, and you can scan input text, replacing portions selected by a regular expression (<a class="docLink" href="ch20.html#ch20">Chapter 20</a>). Finally, if you really need to, you can customize some aspects of the regular expression engine (<a class="docLink" href="ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a>). We look at each of these subjects in a bit more detail in the rest of this chapter and in far more detail in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p class="docText">A <span class="docEmphasis">regular expression</span> is a sequence of characters that can match one or more target sequences of characters according to the rules of a regular expression grammar. For example, the regular expression <tt>&quot;sequence[^s]&quot;</tt> matches the text &quot;sequence&quot; earlier in this sentence but not the text &quot;sequences.&quot; The rules that determine what is and isn't a valid regular expression and what a valid regular expression means are called the regular expression grammar. The grammars supported by the TR1 library are discussed in <a class="docLink" href="ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>.</p>
<p class="docText">When writing regular expressions, it's important to keep in mind that a backslash character has a special meaning both in regular expression grammars and in C++. When you write a regular expression as a string literal in code, the compiler gets the first shot at any backslashes and will treat them as escape characters. If you need to have a backslash in the regular expression itself, you must use two backslashes in the string literal. For example, the regular expression <tt>"\.a"</tt> is the character <tt>'\'</tt> followed by the character <tt>'.'</tt> followed by the character <tt>'a'</tt>. In code, however, a string literal representing that same regular expression has two backslashes.</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>std::string str("\\.a");     <span class="docEmphasis">//</span> str <span class="docEmphasis">holds the character sequence</span> '\'
'.' 'a'
</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Once you know how to write a regular expression that correctly describes the text pattern you want to search for, you need to create an object that encapsulates that pattern. The class template <tt>basic_regex</tt> does this for more or less arbitrary types of characters. You'll almost always be providing regular expressions as sequences of <tt>char</tt> or <tt>wchar_t</tt>, for which you'll use the specializations of <tt>basic_regex</tt> named <tt>regex</tt> and <tt>wregex</tt>, respectively. Objects of these types are constructed from a text sequence that defines a regular expression:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>std ::tr1 :: regex rgx(str );    <span class="docEmphasis">// rgx holds the regular expression "\.a"</span>
</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">When you search for text that matches the pattern defined by a regular expression, you're often interested in more than simply whether a match was found. You usually want to know where the match was in the target sequence and, sometimes, where some matching subsequences occurred. These results are reported through the class templates <tt>sub_match</tt> and <tt>match_results</tt> or, more commonly, through their specializations for use with particular kinds of target sequences. In the following code snippet, <tt>cmatch</tt> can hold the results of a search through an array of <tt>char</tt>:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>std ::tr1 :: cmatch match ;    <span class="docEmphasis">// match will receive search results</span>
</pre></div><br>
<p class="docText">Of course, the reason for using a regular expression in the first place is to search for text that matches it. Three function templates search for matching text. The function template <tt>regex_match</tt> checks whether a target sequence exactly matches the regular expression. The function template <tt>regex_search</tt> looks for the first matching subsequence. The function template <tt>regex_replace</tt> looks for matches and replaces them with new text. These functions all take a regular expression object that defines the pattern to search for and a target sequence that will be searched. The various overloads of the function templates <tt>regex_match</tt> and <tt>regex_search</tt> all return a Boolean value that indicates whether a match was found. Some of the overloads of these function templates also take a <tt>match_results</tt> object for more detailed results:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>if ( std ::tr1 :: regex_search (" aba .a", match, rgx ))
   std :: cout &lt;&lt; " match found after "
      &lt;&lt; match .prefix () &lt;&lt; '\n';
</pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">In the preceding code snippet, <tt>regex_search</tt> looks for the first position in the text <tt>&quot;aba.a&quot;</tt> that matches the regular expression. That match consists of the fourth and fifth characters, so the code snippet will display <tt>&quot;match found after aba&quot;</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText">Here is the complete program that these code snippets were taken from.</P>

<p class="docText">Sometimes, your program needs to split its input text into chunks according to a set of rules that can be defined by a regular expression. Two forms of regular expression iterators do this. You can call an STL algorithm with such an iterator object, and the algorithm will see the individual chunks. In the example that follows, all the code before <tt>main</tt> is infrastructure. The <tt>regex</tt> object <tt>word_sep</tt> holds a regular expression that matches any sequence of text consisting of one or more separator characters, where a separator character is a space, a comma, a period, a horizontal tab, a newline, a semicolon, or a colon. The object <tt>words</tt>, of type <tt>sregex_token_iterator</tt>, uses <tt>word_sep</tt> to separate the input sequence <tt>[text.begin(), text.end())</tt> into tokens separated by subsequences that match the regular expression. Thus, each token is a word from the input text. The <tt>map</tt> object <tt>word_count</tt> counts the number of times each word appears in the text. The <tt>while</tt> loop loops through the words, as determined by <tt>words</tt>, and increments the count for each word it encounters. The call to <tt>copy</tt> shows the result.</P>

<p class="docText">Finally, it's possible to customize the regular expression grammars in limited ways. Each <tt>basic_regex</tt> object has a traits object that it uses to determine whether a particular character has a special meaning and what that meaning is, whether two characters should be treated as equivalent, and so on. This customization is discussed in <a class="docLink" href="ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a>.</P>
