<p class="docText">Before embarking on a porting project, it is important to note which <a name="iddle1110"></a>business processes within the application life cycle will be affected. Business processes currently in place must be modified to accommodate the ported application in terms of having a new platform to support, new test environment, new tools, new documents, and (most important) new customers to support and establish relations with.</P>
<p class="docText">The three main areas of the application life cycle to consider that may affect the business process are development and testing, customer support, and software application distribution:</P>
