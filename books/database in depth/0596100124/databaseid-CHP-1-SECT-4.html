<H3 class="docSection1Title">Model Versus Implementation</h3>
<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0118"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0119"></a>
<p class="docText">Before going any further, there's one very important point I need to explain, because it underpins everything else in this book. The relational model is, of course, a <span class="docEmphasis">data</span> model. Unfortunately, however, this latter term has two quite distinct meanings in the database world. The first and more fundamental meaning is this:</p>
<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Definition:</span> A <span class="docEmphasis">data model</span> (first sense) is an abstract, self-contained, logical definition of the data structures, data operators, and so forth, that together make up the <span class="docEmphasis">abstract machine</span> with which users interact.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">This is the meaning we have in mind when we talk about the relational model in particular. And, armed with this definition, we can usefully (and importantly) go on to distinguish a data model<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0120"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0121"></a> in this first sense from its <span class="docEmphasis">implementation</span><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0122"></a>, which can be defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Definition:</span> An <span class="docEmphasis">implementation</span> of a given data model is a physical realization on a real machine of the components of the abstract machine that together constitute that model.</P></blockquote>
<p class="docText">I'll illustrate these definitions in terms of the relational model specifically. First, and obviously enough, the concept of <span class="docEmphasis">relation</span> is itself part of the model: users have to know what relations are, they have to know they're made up of tuples and attributes, they have to know how to interpret them, and so on. All that is part of the model. But they don't have to know how relations are physically stored on the disk, or how individual data values are physically encoded, or what indexes or other access paths exist; all that is part of the implementation, not part of the model.</p>
<p class="docText">Or consider the concept <span class="docEmphasis">join:</span> users have to know what a join is, they have to know how to invoke a join, they have to know what the result of a join looks like, and so on. Again, all that is part of the model. But they don't have to know how joins are physically implemented, or what expression transformations take place under the covers, or what indexes or other access paths are used, or what physical I/O's occur;<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-1-FNOTE-5">[*]</a></sup> all that is part of the implementation, not the model.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-1-FNOTE-5">[*]</a></sup> I/O = input/output operation.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">In a nutshell, then:</P>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">The model (first meaning) is <span class="docEmphasis">what the user has to know</span>.</P></li><li><p class="docList">The implementation is what the user <span class="docEmphasis">doesn't</span> have to know.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">(Of course, I'm not saying users aren't <span class="docEmphasis">allowed</span> to know about the implementation; I'm just saying they don't have to. In other words, everything to do with the implementation should be, at least potentially, hidden from the user.)</p>
<p class="docText">Here are some important consequences of the foregoing definitions. First, note that performance is fundamentally an implementation issue, not a model issue<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0123"></a>—despite extremely common misconceptions to the contrary. We're often told, for example, that "joins are slow." But such remarks make no sense! Join is part of the model, and the model as such can't be said to be either fast or slow; only implementations can be said to possess any such quality. Thus, we might reasonably say that some specific product <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> has a faster or slower implementation of some specific join than some other specific product <span class="docEmphasis">Y</span>—but that's all.</p>
<a name="databaseid-CHP-1-NOTE-3"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNormalTitle">NOTE</p><p><p class="docText">I don't want to give the wrong impression here. It's true that performance is basically an implementation issue; but that doesn't mean a good implementation will perform well if you use the model badly! Indeed, this is precisely one of the reasons why you need to know the model (I mean, so that you <span class="docEmphasis">don't</span> use it badly). If you write an expression such as S JOIN SP, you're within your rights to expect the implementation to do a good job on it; but if you insist on (in effect) hand-coding the join yourself, perhaps like this:</p>
<pre>
    do for all tuples in S ;
       fetch S tuple into TNO, TN, TS, TC ;
       do for all tuples in SP with SNO = TNO ;
          fetch SP tuple into TNO, TP, TQ ;
          emit tuple TNO, TN, TS, TC, TP, TQ ;
       end ;
    end ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">then there's no way you're going to get good performance. Relational systems should not be used like simple access methods.</p></p></div>
<p class="docText">Second, as you probably realize, it's precisely the fact that model and implementation are logically distinct that enables us to achieve <span class="docEmphasis">data independence</span><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0124"></a>. Data independence (not a great term, by the way, but we're probably stuck with it) means we have the freedom to change the way the data is physically stored and accessed without having to make corresponding changes in the way the data is perceived by the user. The reason we might want to change those storage and access details is, of course, performance; and the fact that we can make such changes without having to change the way the data looks to the user means that existing application programs, queries, and so on can still work. Very importantly, therefore, data independence means <span class="docEmphasis">protecting your investment in user training and applications</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">As you can see from the foregoing definitions, the distinction between model and implementation is really just a special case (a very important special case) of the familiar distinction between <span class="docEmphasis">logical</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">physical</span>. Sadly, however, most of today's database systems, even those that claim to be relational, don't make those distinctions as clearly as they should. As a direct consequence, they deliver far less data independence than they should, and far less than relational systems are theoretically capable of. I'll come back to this issue in the next section, as well as in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-7.html#databaseid-CHP-7">Chapter 7</a>.</P>
<p class="docText">Now I want to turn to the second meaning of the term <span class="docEmphasis">data model</span>, which I dare say you're very familiar with. It can be defined thus:</p>
<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Definition:</span> A <span class="docEmphasis">data model</span> (second sense) is a model of the persistent data of some particular enterprise.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">In other words, a data model in the second sense is just a (possibly somewhat abstract) <span class="docEmphasis">database design</span>. For example, we might speak of the data model for some bank, or some hospital, or some government department.</p>
<p class="docText">Having now explained these two different meanings, I'd like to draw your attention to an analogy that I think nicely illuminates the relationship between them:</p>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">A data model in the first sense is like aprogramming language, whose constructs can be used to solve many specific problems, but in and of themselves have no direct connection with any such specific problem.</p></LI><LI><p class="docList">A data model in the second sense is like a specific program written in that language—it uses the facilities provided by the model, in the first sense of that term, to solve some specific problem.</P></li></UL>
<p class="docText">By the way, it follows from all of the above that if we're talking about data models in the second sense, we might reasonably speak of "relational models" in the plural or "a" relational model (with an indefinite article). But if we're talking about data models in the first sense, then <span class="docEmphasis">there's only one relational model</span>, and it's <span class="docEmphasis">the</span> model (with the definite article). I'll have more to say on this issue in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-8.html#databaseid-CHP-8">Chapter 8</a>.</P>
<p class="docText">For the rest of this book I'll use the term <span class="docEmphasis">data model</span>—or usually just <span class="docEmphasis">model</span> for short—exclusively in its first sense.</P>
