<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0125"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0126"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0127"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0128"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0129"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0130"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0131"></a>
<p class="docText">Now let's get back to an examination of basic relational concepts. In this section I want to focus on some specific properties of relations themselves. First of all, every relation<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0132"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0133"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0134"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0135"></a> has a <span class="docEmphasis">heading</span> and a <span class="docEmphasis">body:</span> the heading is a set of attributes (where an <span class="docEmphasis">attribute</span> is an attribute-name:type-name pair<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0136"></a>), and the body is a set of tuples that conform to that heading. In the case of the suppliers relation of <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1-SECT-3.html#databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a>, for example, there are four attributes in the heading and five tuples in the body. Note, therefore, that a relation doesn't really contain tuples들t contains a body, and that body in turn contains the tuples득ut we do usually talk as if relations contained tuples directly, for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p class="docText">By the way, although it's strictly correct to say that the heading consists of attribute-name:type-name pairs, it's usual to omit the type names in pictures like <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1-SECT-3.html#databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a> and thereby pretend that the heading is a set of attribute names only. For example, the STATUS attribute does have a type (INTEGER, let's say), but I didn't show it in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1-SECT-3.html#databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a>. But you should never forget it's there!</p>
<p class="docText">Next, the number of attributes in the heading is the <span class="docEmphasis">degree</span> (sometimes the <span class="docEmphasis">arity</span><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0137"></a>), and the number of tuples in the body is the <span class="docEmphasis">cardinality</span>. For example, relations S, P, and SP in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1-SECT-3.html#databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a> have degree 4, 5, and 3, respectively, and cardinality 5, 6, and 12, respectively.</p>
<p class="docText">Next, relations <span class="docEmphasis">never</span> contain duplicate tuples. This property follows because a body is a <span class="docEmphasis">set</span> of tuples, and sets in mathematics do not contain duplicate elements. By the way, SQL fails here: SQL tables are allowed to contain duplicate rows, as I'm sure you know, and SQL tables are thus not relations, in general. Please understand, therefore, that in this book I <span class="docEmphasis">always</span> use the term "relation" to mean a relation등ithout duplicate tuples, by definition드nd not an SQL table. Please understand also that relational operations <span class="docEmphasis">always</span> produce a result without duplicate tuples, again by definition. For example, projecting the suppliers relation of <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1-SECT-3.html#databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a> on CITY produces the result shown on the left and <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> the one on the right:</P>
<a name="databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-u02"></a><p><center>
<H5 class="docFigureTitle"></h5>
<img border="0" alt=""  width="139" height="108" SRC="images/0596100124/figs/databaseid_01_u02.gif"></center></P><BR>
<p class="docText">(The result on the left can be obtained via the SQL query SELECT DISTINCT S.CITY FROM S. Omitting DISTINCT leads to the nonrelational result on the right. Note in particular that the table on the right has no double underlining; that's because it has no key, and hence <span class="docEmphasis">a fortiori</span> no primary key.)</P>
<p class="docText">Next, the tuples of a relation are <span class="docEmphasis">unordered</span>, top to bottom. This property follows because, again, a body is a set, and sets in mathematics have no ordering to their elements. (Thus, for example, {<span class="docEmphasis">a,b,c</span>} and {<span class="docEmphasis">c,a,b</span>} are the same set in mathematics, and the same kind of thing is naturally true in the relational model.) Of course, when we draw a relation as a table on paper, we do have to show the rows in some top-to-bottom order, but that ordering doesn't correspond to anything relational. In the case of the suppliers relation of <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1-SECT-3.html#databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a>, for example, I could have shown the rows in any order듭ay, supplier S3, then S1, then S5, then S4, then S2드nd the picture would still represent the same relation.</P>
<a name="databaseid-CHP-1-NOTE-4"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNormalTitle">NOTE</p><p><p class="docText">The fact that the tuples of a relation are unordered doesn't mean queries can't include an ORDER BY<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0138"></a> specification, but it does mean that such queries produce a result that's not a relation. ORDER BY is useful for the purpose of displaying results, but it isn't a relational operator as such.</p></p></div>
<p class="docText">In similar fashion, the attributes of a relation are also <span class="docEmphasis">unordered</span>, left to right, because a heading too is a mathematical set. Again, when we draw a relation as a table on paper, we have to show the columns in some left-to-right order, but that ordering doesn't correspond to anything relational. In the case of the suppliers relation of <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1-SECT-3.html#databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a>, for example, I could have shown the columns in any left-to-right order듭ay STATUS, SNAME, CITY, SNO드nd the picture would still represent the same relation in the relational model. Incidentally, SQL fails here too: SQL tables do have a left-to-right ordering to their columns (another reason why SQL tables aren't relations, in general). For example, the pictures below represent the same relation, but two different SQL tables:</p>
<a name="databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-u03"></a><p><center>
<h5 class="docFigureTitle"></h5>
<img border="0" alt=""  width="236" height="108" SRC="images/0596100124/figs/databaseid_01_u03.gif"></center></p><br>
<p class="docText">(The corresponding SQL queries are, respectively, SELECT S.SNO, S.CITY FROM S and SELECT S.CITY, S.SNO FROM S. By the way, you might be thinking that the difference between these two tables is hardly very significant; in fact, however, it has some serious consequences, some of which I'll be touching on in later chapters.)</p>
<p class="docText">Next, relations are always <span class="docEmphasis">normalized</span> (equivalently, they're in <span class="docEmphasis">first normal form</span><a name="IDX-CHP-1-0139"></a>, 1NF). Informally, this means that, in terms of the tabular picture of a relation, at every row-and-column intersection we always see just a single value. More formally, it means that every tuple in every relation contains just a single value, of the appropriate type, in every attribute position. I'll have quite a lot more to say on this particular issue in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="docText">Next, we draw a distinction between <span class="docEmphasis">base</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">derived</span> relations. As I explained earlier, the operators of the relational algebra allow us to start with some given relations듫erhaps those of <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1-SECT-3.html#databaseid-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3</a>드nd obtain further relations from those given ones. The given relations are the base ones; the others are derived. Now, a relational system obviously has to provide a means for defining the base relations in the first place. In SQL, this task is performed by the CREATE TABLE statement (the SQL counterpart to a base relation<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0140"></a> being, of course, a base <span class="docEmphasis">table</span>). And base relations obviously have to be named듡or example:</p>
<pre>
    CREATE TABLE SP ... ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">But certain derived relations들ncluding in particular what are called <span class="docEmphasis">views</span>드re also named. A view<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0141"></a> (also known as a <span class="docEmphasis">virtual relation</span>) is a named relation whose value at all times is the result of evaluating a certain relational expression at the time in question. Here's an SQL example:</P>
<pre>
    CREATE VIEW SST_PARIS AS
       SELECT S.SNO, S.STATUS
       FROM   S
       WHERE  S.CITY = 'Paris' ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">You can operate on views as if they were base relations, but they <span class="docEmphasis">aren't</span> base relations; instead, you can think of views as being materialized들n effect, you can think of a base relation as being dynamically built드t the time they're referenced. (Though I should emphasize that thinking of views being materialized when they're referenced is <span class="docEmphasis">only</span> a way of thinking; it's not what's really supposed to happen. How views really work is explained in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-4.html#databaseid-CHP-4">Chapter 4</a>.)</p>
<p class="docText">There's an important point I need to make here. You'll often see people describe the difference between base relations and views like this:</p>
<ul><LI><p class="docList">Base relations really exist듮hat is, they're physically stored in the database.</P></li><LI><p class="docList">Views, by contrast, don't "really exist"듮hey merely provide different ways of looking at the base relations.</P></LI></ul>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">But the relational model has nothing to say about what's physically stored!</span> In particular, it does <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> say that base relations are physically stored. The only requirement is that there must be some mapping between whatever <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> physically stored and those base relations, so that those base relations can somehow be constructed when they're needed (conceptually speaking, at any rate). If the base relations can be constructed in this way, then so can everything else. For example, we might physically store the join of suppliers and shipments, instead of storing them separately; base relations S and SP then could be constructed, conceptually, by taking appropriate projections of that join. In other words, base relations are no more (and no less!) "physical" than views are, so far as the relational model is concerned.</P>
<p class="docText">The fact that the relational model says nothing about physical storage is deliberate, of course. The idea was to give implementers the freedom to implement the model in whatever way they chose들n particular, in whatever way seemed likely to yield good performance등ithout compromising on data independence<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0142"></a>. The sad fact is, however, that SQL vendors seem mostly not to have understood this point; instead, they map base tables fairly directly to physical storage,<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-1-FNOTE-6">[*]</a></sup> and (as noted in the previous section) their products therefore provide far less data independence than relational systems are theoretically capable of. Indeed, this state of affairs is reflected in the SQL standard itself드s well as in most other SQL documentation등hich typically (fairly ubiquitously, in fact) uses expressions such as "tables and views." Clearly, anyone who uses such an expression is under the impression that tables and views are different things, and probably under the impression too that "tables" are physical and views aren't. But the whole point about a view is that it <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> a table (or, as I would prefer to say, a relation); that is, we can perform the same kinds of operations on views as we can on regular relations (at least in the relational model), because views <span class="docEmphasis">are</span> "regular relations"! Throughout this book, therefore, I'll reserve the term <span class="docEmphasis">relation</span> to mean a relation (possibly a base relation, possibly a view, possibly a query result, and so on); if I mean (for example) a base relation specifically, then I'll <span class="docEmphasis">say</span> "base relation." And I suggest very strongly that you adopt the same discipline for yourself. Don't fall into the common trap of thinking that the term <span class="docEmphasis">relation</span> means a base relation specifically.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-1-FNOTE-6">[*]</a></sup> I say this knowing full well that today's SQL products provide a variety of options for hashing, partitioning, indexing, clustering, and otherwise organizing the data as stored on the disk. I still consider the mapping to physical storage in those products to be "fairly direct."</P></blockquote>
