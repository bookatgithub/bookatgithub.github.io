<H3 class="docSection1Title">Summary</h3>
<p class="docText">For the most part, the aim of this preliminary chapter has been to tell you what I rather hope you knew already (and you might therefore have felt it was rather light on technical substance). Anyway, just to review briefly:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">I explained why we'd be concerned in this book with principles, not products, and why I'd be using formal terminology such as <span class="docEmphasis">relations, tuples</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">attributes</span> in place of their more "user-friendly" SQL counterparts.</P></li><LI><p class="docList">I claimed that SQL and the relational model aren't the same thing. We've seen a few differences already—for example, the fact that SQL permits duplicate rows—and we'll see many more in later chapters.</p></LI><LI><p class="docList">I gave an overview of the original model, touching in particular on the following concepts: <span class="docEmphasis">type</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">n-ary relation</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">tuple</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">attribute</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">candidate key</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">primary key</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">foreign key</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">entity integrity</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">referential integrity</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">relational assignment</span>, and the <span class="docEmphasis">relational algebra</span>. With regard to the algebra, I mentioned <span class="docEmphasis">closure</span> and very briefly described the operators <span class="docEmphasis">restrict</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">project</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">product</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">intersection</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">union</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">difference</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">join</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">divide</span>.</P></LI><li><p class="docList">I discussed various properties of relations, introducing the terms <span class="docEmphasis">heading, body, cardinality</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">degree</span>. Relations have no duplicate tuples, no tuple ordering top to bottom, and no attribute ordering left to right. I also discussed <span class="docEmphasis">views</span>.</p></li><li><p class="docList">I discussed the differences between <span class="docEmphasis">model</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">implementation</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">relations</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">relvars</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">values</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">variables</span> in general. The model versus implementation discussion in particular led to a discussion of <span class="docEmphasis">data independence</span>.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">One last point (I didn't mention this explicitly before, but I hope it's obvious from everything I did say): overall, the relational model is <span class="docEmphasis">declarative</span>, not <span class="docEmphasis">procedural</span>, in nature; that is, we favor declarative solutions over procedural ones, wherever such solutions are feasible. The reason is obvious: <span class="docEmphasis">declarative</span> means the system does the work, <span class="docEmphasis">procedural</span> means the user does the work (so we're talking about productivity, among other things). That's why the relational model supports declarative<a name="IDX-CHP-1-0158"></a> queries, declarative updates, declarative view definitions, declarative integrity constraints, and so on.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-1-FNOTE-8">[*]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-1-FNOTE-8">[*]</a></sup> As this book was going to press, I was informed that at least one well-known SQL product apparently uses the term "declarative" to mean the system <span class="docEmphasis">doesn't</span> do the work! That is, it allows the user to state certain things declaratively (for example, the fact that a certain view has a certain key), but it doesn't enforce the constraint implied by that declaration—it simply assumes the user is going to enforce it instead. Such terminological abuses do little to help the cause of genuine understanding. <span class="docEmphasis">Caveat lector</span>.</p></blockquote>
