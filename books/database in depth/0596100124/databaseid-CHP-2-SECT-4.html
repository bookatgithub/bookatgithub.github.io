<p class="docText">It's usual to think of types as being either <span class="docEmphasis">scalar</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">nonscalar</span>. Loosely, a type is scalar if it has no user-visible components and nonscalar otherwise—and the values, variables, attributes, operators, parameters, and expressions of some type <span class="docEmphasis">T</span> are scalar or nonscalar according as type <span class="docEmphasis">T</span> itself is scalar or nonscalar. For example:</p>
<UL><li><p class="docList">Type INTEGER is a scalar type; hence, values, variables, and so on of type INTEGER are also all scalar, meaning they have no user-visible components.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Tuple and relation types are nonscalar—the pertinent user-visible components being, of course, the corresponding attributes—and hence tuple<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0230"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-2-0231"></a> and relation values, variables, and so on are also all nonscalar.</P></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">That said, I must now stress the point that these notions are quite informal. Indeed, we've already seen that the concept of <span class="docEmphasis">atomicity</span> has no absolute meaning, and "scalarness" is just the concept of atomicity by another name. Thus, the relational model nowhere <span class="docEmphasis">formally</span> relies on the scalar versus nonscalar distinction. In this book, however, I do rely on it informally; to be specific, I use the term <span class="docEmphasis">scalar</span> in connection with types that are neither tuple nor relation types, and the term <span class="docEmphasis">nonscalar</span> in connection with types that <span class="docEmphasis">are</span> either tuple or relation types.</P>
<p class="docText">Let's look at an example. Here's a <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> definition for the base relvar<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0232"></a> S (suppliers):</P>
<pre>
    1 VAR S BASE
    2     RELATION<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0233"></a> { SNO SNO, SNAME NAME, STATUS INTEGER, CITY CHAR }
    3     KEY<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0234"></a> { SNO } ;</pre><BR>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Explanation</span>:</p>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">The keyword VAR in line 1 means this is a variable definition; the keyword BASE means the variable is a base relvar specifically.</P></LI><LI><p class="docList">Line 2 specifies the type of this variable. The keyword RELATION shows it's a relation type; the rest of the line specifies the set of attributes that make up the corresponding heading (where, as you'll recall from <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a>, an attribute is an attribute-name:type-name pair). The type is, of course, a nonscalar type. No significance attaches to the order in which the attributes are specified.</P></li><li><p class="docList">Line 3 defines {SNO} to be a candidate key for this relvar.</P></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">In fact, the example also illustrates another point—namely, that the type:</p>
<pre>
    RELATION { SNO SNO, SNAME NAME, STATUS INTEGER, CITY CHAR }</pre><br>

<p class="docText">is an example of a <span class="docEmphasis">generated</span> type. In general, a generated type<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0235"></a> is one that's obtained by invoking some <span class="docEmphasis">type generator</span><a name="IDX-CHP-2-0236"></a> (in the example, the type generator is RELATION). You can think of a type generator as a special kind of operator; it's special because (a) it returns a type instead of (for example) a scalar value, and (b) it's invoked at compile time instead of run time. For instance, most programming languages support a type generator called ARRAY, which lets users define a variety of specific array types. For the purposes of this book, however, the only type generators we need to consider are TUPLE and, of course, RELATION. Here's an example involving the TUPLE type generator:</p>
<pre>
    VAR SINGLE_SUPPLIER
        TUPLE { STATUS INTEGER, SNO SNO, CITY CHAR, SNAME NAME } ;</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">The value of variable SINGLE_SUPPLIER at any given time is a tuple<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0237"></a> with the same heading as that of relvar S. (I've specified the attributes in a different sequence deliberately, just to show that the sequence doesn't matter.) Thus, we might imagine a code fragment that, first, extracts a one-tuple relation (perhaps the relation containing just the tuple for supplier S1) from the current value of relvar S; then extracts the single tuple from that one-tuple relation; and, finally, assigns that tuple to the variable SINGLE_SUPPLIER. In <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span>:</p>
<pre>
    SINGLE_SUPPLIER := TUPLE FROM ( S WHERE SNO = SNO('S1') ) ;</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">By the way, note carefully that a tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> and a relation <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> that contains just that tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> aren't the same thing. In particular, they're of different types—<span class="docEmphasis">t</span> is of some tuple type and <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> is of some relation type (though of course they do have the same heading).</p>
<a name="databaseid-CHP-2-NOTE-5"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNormalTitle">NOTE</P><P><p class="docText">I don't want you to misunderstand me here. While a variable like SINGLE_SUPPLIER might well be needed in some application program that accesses the suppliers-and-parts database, I'm <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> saying that such a variable can appear inside the database itself. A relational database contains variables of exactly one kind—namely, <span class="docEmphasis">relation</span> variables (relvars); that is, relvars are the <span class="docEmphasis">only</span> kind of variable allowed in a relational database. I'll revisit this point in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-8.html#databaseid-CHP-8">Chapter 8</a>, in connection with what's called <span class="docEmphasis">The Information Principle</span>.</P></P></div>
<p class="docText">There's just one more thing I want to say about tuple and relation types: even though such types do obviously have user-visible components (namely, their attributes), there's no suggestion that those components have to be physically stored as such. In fact, the physical representation of values of such types should be hidden from the user, just as it is for scalar types.</p>
