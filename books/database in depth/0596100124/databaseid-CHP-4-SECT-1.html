<p class="docText">The first point I want to stress is that, regardless of what syntax we use to express it, relational assignment is a <span class="docEmphasis">set-level</span> operation. (In fact, <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> operations in the relational model are set-level, as we'll see in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-5.html#databaseid-CHP-5">Chapter 5</a>.) Thus, INSERT inserts a set of tuples into the target relvar; DELETE deletes a set of tuples from the target relvar; and UPDATE updates a set of tuples in the target relvar. Now, it's true that we often talk in terms of (for example) updating some individual tuple as such, but you need to understand that:</P>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">Such talk really means the set of tuples we're updating just happens to have cardinality one.</p></li><LI><p class="docList">What's more, updating a set of tuples of cardinality one sometimes isn't possible anyway.</P></li></ul>
<p class="docText">For example, suppose relvar S is subject to the integrity constraint (see <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-6.html#databaseid-CHP-6">Chapter 6</a>) that suppliers S1 and S4 are always in the same city. Then any "single-tuple UPDATE" that tries to change the city for just one of those two suppliers will necessarily fail. Instead, we must update them both at the same time, perhaps like this (SQL):</p>
<pre>
    UPDATE S
    SET    CITY = 'New York'
    WHERE  S.SNO = SNO('S1') OR S.SNO = SNO('S4') ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">What's being updated here is, obviously enough, a set of two tuples.</P>
<a name="databaseid-CHP-4-NOTE-12"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNormalTitle">NOTE</p><P><p class="docText">Here, for interest, is the same update expressed in <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> (it looks very similar, as you can see):</p>
<pre>
    UPDATE S WHERE SNO = SNO('S1') OR SNO = SNO('S4')
           ( CITY := 'New York' ) ;</pre><BR>
</P></div>
<p class="docText">One consequence of the foregoing is that there's nothing in the relational model that resembles SQL's "positioned updates" (that is, UPDATE or DELETE "WHERE CURRENT OF cursor"), because those operations are tuple-level, not set-level, by definition. They do happen to work in today's products, most of the time, but that's because those products aren't very good at supporting integrity constraints. If the products were to improve in that regard, those "positioned updates" might <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> work any more; that is, applications that succeed today might fail tomorrow—not a very desirable state of affairs, it seems to me.</P>
<p class="docText">Now I need to 'fess up to something. The fact is, to talk as I've been doing of "updating a tuple"—or set of tuples, rather—is very imprecise (not to say sloppy) anyway. If <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> is subject to update, then <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> must be a <span class="docEmphasis">variable</span> by definition, not a value, and tuples, like relations, are <span class="docEmphasis">values</span> and can't be updated, again by definition. What we really mean when we talk of (for example) updating tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t1</span> to <span class="docEmphasis">t2</span>, within some relvar <span class="docEmphasis">R</span>, is that we're <span class="docEmphasis">replacing</span> tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t1</span> in <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> by another tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t2</span>. And that kind of talk is still sloppy! What we <span class="docEmphasis">really</span> mean is that we're replacing the relation <span class="docEmphasis">r1</span> that's the original value of <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> by another relation <span class="docEmphasis">r2</span>. And what exactly is relation <span class="docEmphasis">r2</span> here? Well, let <span class="docEmphasis">s1</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s2</span> be relations containing just tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t1</span> and tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t2</span>, respectively; then <span class="docEmphasis">r2</span> is (<span class="docEmphasis">r1</span> MINUS <span class="docEmphasis">s1</span>) UNION <span class="docEmphasis">s2</span>. In other words, "updating tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t1</span> to <span class="docEmphasis">t2</span> in relvar <span class="docEmphasis">R</span>" can be thought of as first deleting <span class="docEmphasis">t1</span> and then inserting <span class="docEmphasis">t2</span>—if (despite everything I've been saying) I might be permitted to talk in terms of deleting and inserting individual tuples in this loose fashion.</P>
<p class="docText">In the same kind of way, it doesn't really make sense to talk in terms of "updating attribute <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> within tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t</span>"—or within relation <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>, or even within relvar <span class="docEmphasis">R</span>. Of course, we do it anyway, because it's convenient (it saves a lot of circumlocution); but it's like that business of user-friendly terminology I discussed in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a>—it's OK to do it only if we all understand that such talk is only an approximation to the truth, and indeed it tends to obscure the essence of what's really going on.</p>
