<a name="IDX-CHP-4-0318"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-4-0319"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-4-0320"></a>
<p class="docText">I explained the basic idea of foreign keys in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a>, but here's a precise definition (note the reliance on tuple equality once again):</P>
<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Definition:</span> Let <span class="docEmphasis">R1</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">R2</span> be relvars, not necessarily distinct, and let <span class="docEmphasis">K</span> be a key for <span class="docEmphasis">R1</span>. Let <span class="docEmphasis">FK</span> be a subset of the heading of <span class="docEmphasis">R2</span> that, possibly after some attribute renaming, involves exactly the same attributes as <span class="docEmphasis">K</span>. Then <span class="docEmphasis">FK</span> is a <span class="docEmphasis">foreign key</span><a name="IDX-CHP-4-0321"></a> if and only if, at all times, every tuple in <span class="docEmphasis">R2</span> has an <span class="docEmphasis">FK</span> value that is equal to the <span class="docEmphasis">K</span> value in some (necessarily unique) tuple in <span class="docEmphasis">R1</span> at the time in question.</P></blockquote>
<p class="docText">As we know, in the suppliers-and-parts database, {SNO} and {PNO} are foreign keys in relvar SP, referencing the sole candidate key—in fact, the primary key—in relvar S and relvar P, respectively. Here's another example:</P>
<pre>
    VAR EMP BASE RELATION
      { ENO ENO, ..., MNO ENO, ... }
        KEY { ENO }
        FOREIGN KEY { RENAME ( MNO AS ENO ) } REFERENCES EMP ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">Attribute MNO here denotes the employee number of the manager of the employee identified by ENO; thus, the "referencing relvar<a name="IDX-CHP-4-0322"></a>" (<span class="docEmphasis">R2</span> in the definition) and the "referenced relvar" (<span class="docEmphasis">R1</span> in the definition) in this example are one and the same. For example, the EMP tuple for employee E3 might include an MNO value of E2, which constitutes a reference to the EMP tuple for employee E2. But foreign key values, like candidate key values, are tuples <span class="docEmphasis">;</span> conceptually, therefore, we have to rename the MNO attribute in the foreign key specification, in order for the tuple equality comparison to be valid. (What tuple equality comparison? The one that's implicit in the process of checking the foreign key constraint—recall that tuples must certainly be of the same type if they're to be tested for equality, and "same type" means they must have the same attribute names.)</p>
<p class="docText">As an aside, I should mention that the relational model as originally formulated required foreign keys to match not just some candidate key but, very specifically, the <span class="docEmphasis">primary</span> key in the referenced relvar. However, I gave my reasons in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a> for not insisting that some candidate key always be chosen and made primary; accordingly, therefore, I don't want to insist that foreign keys always match primary keys specifically. (I agree with SQL on this one.)</P>
<p class="docText">Now, SQL supports not just foreign keys as such but also certain associated <span class="docEmphasis">referential actions</span> such as CASCADE (which can be specified as part of either an ON DELETE clause or an ON UPDATE clause). For example, the CREATE TABLE statement for shipments might include the following:</P>
<pre>
    FOREIGN KEY ( SNO ) REFERENCES S ( SNO ) ON DELETE CASCADE</pre><br>

<p class="docText">Given this specification, an attempt to delete a specific supplier will cascade to delete all shipments for that supplier as well. I mention this point for the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">First, such specifications might be useful in practice, but they aren't part of the relational model as such.</P></li><LI><p class="docList">But that's not necessarily a problem! The relational model is the foundation of the database field, but it's <span class="docEmphasis">only</span> the foundation. There's no reason why additional features shouldn't be built on top of, or alongside, that foundation—just so long as those additions don't violate the prescriptions of the model, of course (and are in the spirit of the model and can be shown to be useful, I suppose I should add). To elaborate:</p><div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="a"><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Type theory provides the most obvious example. We saw in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-2.html#databaseid-CHP-2">Chapter 2</a> that "types are orthogonal to tables," but we also saw that full and proper type support in relational systems is highly desirable, to say the very least.</P></div></LI><LI><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">By way of a second example, the relational model has almost nothing to say about recovery and concurrency controls, but this fact obviously doesn't mean that relational systems shouldn't provide such controls. (Actually it could be argued that the relational model does say something about such matters implicitly, because it relies on the DBMS to implement updates properly and not to lose data—but it doesn't prescribe anything specific.)</p></div></li></ol></div></li></ul>
<p class="docText">One final remark to close this section: I've discussed foreign keys because they're of considerable pragmatic importance, and also because they're part of the model as originally defined. But I think I should stress the point that they aren't truly fundamental—they're really just shorthand for certain integrity constraints that are commonly required in practice, as we'll see in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-6.html#databaseid-CHP-6">Chapter 6</a>.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-4-FNOTE-2">[*]</a></sup> (In fact, much the same could be said for candidate keys as well, but in that case the practical benefits of providing a shorthand are overwhelming.)</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-4-FNOTE-2">[*]</a></sup> Precisely for this reason, in fact, explicit support for them is currently omitted from <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span>. However, I'm sure an "industrial-strength" version of that language would support them, and I'm taking the liberty in this book of pretending such support is already there.</p></blockquote>
