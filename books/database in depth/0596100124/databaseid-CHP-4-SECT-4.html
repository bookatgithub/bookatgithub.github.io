<p class="docText">A view<a name="IDX-CHP-4-0325"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-4-0326"></a>, also called a virtual relvar, is a relvar that doesn't have separate existence in its own right but looks to the user as if it did. Here's a definition:</P>
<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Definition:</span> A <span class="docEmphasis">view</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">virtual relvar V</span> is a relvar whose value at time <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> is the result of evaluating a certain relational expression at that time <span class="docEmphasis">t</span>. The expression in question is specified when <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> is defined and must mention at least one relvar.</P></blockquote>
<p class="docText">The following are a couple of examples, "London suppliers" and "non-London suppliers" (<span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> on the left, SQL on the right):</P>

    VAR LS VIRTUAL                    |  CREATE VIEW LS AS
    ( S WHERE CITY = 'London' ) ;     |  ( SELECT S.*
    WHERE  S.SNO IN                   |  FROM   S

<H4 class="docSection2Title">View Retrievals</H4>
<a name="IDX-CHP-4-0327"></a>
<p class="docText">To repeat, views are meant to look to the user as if they had their own separate existence; in other words, they're supposed to "look and feel" just like base relvars so far as the user is concerned. In particular, the user should be able to operate on views as if they were base relvars, and the DBMS should be able to map those user operations into suitable operations on the base relvars in terms of which the views are ultimately defined. I say "ultimately" here because (of course) one thing we can do, if views really do behave just like base relvars, is define further views on top of them, as in this SQL example:</p>
<pre>
    CREATE VIEW LS_STATUS
      AS ( SELECT LS.SNO, LS.STATUS
           FROM   LS ) ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">Mapping read-only operations is straightforward. For example, suppose we issue this SQL query on view LS:</p>
<pre>
    SELECT LS.SNO
    FROM   LS
    WHERE  LS.STATUS &gt; 10</pre><br>

<p class="docText">First, the DBMS replaces the reference to the view in the FROM clause by the expression that defines that view, yielding:</P>
<pre>
    SELECT LS.SNO
    FROM ( SELECT S.*
           FROM   S
           WHERE  S.CITY = 'London' ) AS LS
    WHERE  LS.STATUS &gt; 10</pre><br>

<p class="docText">This expression can now be simplified to:</P>
<pre>
    SELECT S.SNO
    FROM   S
    WHERE  S.CITY = 'London'
    AND    S.STATUS &gt; 10</pre><br>

<p class="docText">The reason the foregoing process works is precisely because of the <span class="docEmphasis">closure</span> property of the relational algebra. Closure implies, among other things, that wherever we're allowed to have the <span class="docEmphasis">name</span> of something—for example, in a query—we can always have a more general expression that evaluates to a thing of the appropriate type.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-4-FNOTE-3">[*]</a></sup> In the FROM clause, for example, we can have an SQL table name; thus we can also have a more general SQL table expression, and that's why we're allowed to substitute the expression that defines the view LS for the name LS in the example.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-4-FNOTE-3">[*]</a></sup> I would much have preferred to use the more formal term <span class="docEmphasis">object</span> in this sentence in place of the very vague term <span class="docEmphasis">thing</span>, but <span class="docEmphasis">object</span> has become a loaded term in computing contexts.</P></blockquote>
<p class="docText">By the way, it's worth mentioning that the foregoing process didn't always work in early versions of SQL (to be specific, in versions of the SQL standard prior to 1992), because those early versions failed to support closure properly. As a result, certain innocuous-looking queries against certain innocuous-looking tables (actually views) failed—and failed, moreover, in ways that were hard to explain. Here's a simple example:</P>
<pre>
    CREATE VIEW V
      AS ( SELECT S.CITY, SUM ( S.STATUS ) AS ST
           FROM   S
           GROUP  BY S.CITY ) ;


    SELECT V.CITY
    FROM   V
    WHERE  V.ST &gt; 25</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">This example failed in the SQL standard prior to 1992. And although the standard has now been fixed, it doesn't follow that all of the products have! And indeed there's at least one major product that still hasn't, at the time of writing (early 2005).</p>

<p class="docText">The important point here is as follows: instead of S being the base relvar and LS and NLS views, <span class="docEmphasis">LS and NLS could be base relvars and S could be a view</span>, like this:</p>

    VAR LS BASE RELATION
      { SNO SNO, SNAME NAME, STATUS INTEGER, CITY CHAR }

    VAR NLS BASE RELATION

<a name="databaseid-CHP-4-NOTE-14"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNormalTitle">NOTE</p><p><p class="docText">In order to achieve complete equivalence, we would also have to specify certain constraints—in particular, constraints to the effect that every CITY value in LS is London and every CITY value in NLS is <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> London—but I omit such details here. See <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-6.html#databaseid-CHP-6">Chapter 6</a> for further discussion of such matters.</p></p></div>
<p class="docText">The message of this example is that, to a very large extent, <span class="docEmphasis">which relvars are base and which virtual is arbitrary</span>—from which it follows that there must be no arbitrary and unnecessary distinctions between base and virtual relvars. This state of affairs is referred to as <span class="docEmphasis">The Principle of Interchangeability</span> (of base and virtual relvars). Here are some implications:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Like base relvars, views are subject to integrity constraints. (We usually think of integrity constraints as applying just to base relvars, but <span class="docEmphasis">The Principle of Interchangeability</span> shows that this position isn't really tenable.)</P></li><li><p class="docList">In particular, views have candidate keys (and so I should perhaps have included some key specifications in my view examples prior to this point; <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> permits such specifications, but SQL doesn't). They might also have foreign keys, and foreign keys might refer to them.</p></li><LI><p class="docList">I didn't mention this point in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a>, but the "entity integrity" rule is supposed to apply specifically to base relvars, not views. It thereby violates <span class="docEmphasis">The Principle of Interchangeability</span>. (Of course, I reject that rule anyway, because it has to do with nulls.)</P></li><LI><p class="docList">Many SQL products, and the SQL standard, provide some kind of "row ID" feature. If that feature applies to base tables and not to views—which in practice is quite likely—it violates <span class="docEmphasis">The Principle of Interchangeability</span>.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-4-FNOTE-4">[*]</a></sup> Of course, row IDs as such aren't part of the relational model, but that fact in itself doesn't mean they shouldn't be supported. But I observe as an important aside that if those row IDs are regarded as some kind of <span class="docEmphasis">object</span> ID in the object-oriented sense (as they are, most unfortunately, in the SQL standard, as well as in most of the major SQL products), then they're definitely prohibited! Object IDs are effectively <span class="docEmphasis">pointers</span>, and the relational model explicitly prohibits pointers.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-4-FNOTE-4">[*]</a></sup> It might violate <span class="docEmphasis">The Information Principle</span>, too (see <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-8.html#databaseid-CHP-8">Chapter 8</a>).</P></blockquote></li></UL>
<p class="docText">And, to revert to the main point of this discussion, we <span class="docEmphasis">must</span> be able to update views—because if we can't, then that fact in itself constitutes the clearest possible violation of <span class="docEmphasis">The Principle of Interchangeability</span>.</P>
<p class="docText">As you probably know, SQL's support for this requirement is quite weak, both in the standard and in the major commercial products. It does at least typically include support for updates on views defined as simple restrictions and/or projections of a single underlying base relvar (though even here there are some problems). For example, consider the following view (which is essentially identical to one we saw in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a>):</P>
<pre>
    CREATE VIEW SST_PARIS
      AS ( SELECT S.SNO, S.STATUS
           FROM   S
           WHERE  S.CITY = 'Paris' ) ;</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">This view is a projection of a restriction of base table S, and so we might, for example, be able to perform the following DELETE on it:</P>
<pre>
    DELETE
    FROM   SST_PARIS
    WHERE  SST_PARIS.STATUS &gt; 15 ;</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">This DELETE maps to:</p>
<pre>
    DELETE
    FROM   S
    WHERE  S.CITY = 'Paris'
    AND    S.STATUS &gt; 15 ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">But few products provide support for updating views that are much more sophisticated than this one.</P>
<p class="docText">Unfortunately, I'm now straying into an area in which there's still a certain amount of controversy. My own opinion is that the view updating problem has largely been solved (that is, the theory exists); however, not everybody agrees with me, and in any case a detailed discussion of the subject requires rather more background than it's possible to include in a book of this nature. Thus, I'm afraid the best I can do here is refer you to another book—<span class="docEmphasis">Databases, Types, and the Relational Model: The Third Manifesto</span>, Third Edition (Addison-Wesley, 2006), by C. J. Date and Hugh Darwen, where the subject is examined in depth—if you want more specifics.</P>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Miscellaneous Points</h4>
<a name="IDX-CHP-4-0337"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-4-0338"></a>
<p class="docText">There are a few more things I need to say in order to finish up this section. First of all, it's well known, but worth mentioning anyway, that views serve two rather different purposes:</p>
<ul><LI><p class="docList">The user who actually defines view <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> is, obviously, aware of the expression <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> in terms of which <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> is defined. That user can use the name <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> wherever the expression <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> is intended, but such uses are basically just shorthand.</p></LI><li><p class="docList">By contrast, a user who's merely informed that <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> exists and is available for use is supposed (at least ideally) <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> to be aware of the expression <span class="docEmphasis">X;</span> to that user, in fact, <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> is supposed to look and feel just like a base relvar, as we've already seen. And it's this second use of views that's the really important one, and the one I've been concentrating on, tacitly, throughout this section so far.</P></LI></UL>
<p class="docText">Second, when I explained what a view was at the beginning of this section, I said the relational expression that defined the view had to mention at least one relvar. Why? Because if it doesn't, the "virtual relvar" won't be a relvar at all!—I mean, it won't be a <span class="docEmphasis">variable</span>, and it certainly won't be updatable. Instead, it'll be a <span class="docEmphasis">relation constant</span><a name="IDX-CHP-4-0339"></a>, or what we might call a "relcon<a name="IDX-CHP-4-0340"></a>." For example (to invent some syntax on the fly):</P>
<pre>
    CONST PERIODIC_TABLE ( RELATION {
          TUPLE { ELEMENT 'Hydrogen', SYMBOL 'H' , ATOMICNO  1 },
          TUPLE { ELEMENT 'Helium'  , SYMBOL 'He', ATOMICNO  2 },
          ...
          TUPLE { ELEMENT 'Uranium' , SYMBOL 'U' , ATOMICNO 92 }
                                    } ) ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">While it certainly might be desirable to provide some kind of "relcon" functionality along the foregoing lines, I don't think we should think of such things as relvars. I don't think it helps the cause of understanding to pretend that constants are variables.</p>
<p class="docText">Third, an unfortunate terminological clash is arising as I write, certainly in the academic world, and to some extent in the commercial world also. Recall from <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a> that a view can be thought of as a derived relvar. Well, there's another kind of derived relvar, too, called a <span class="docEmphasis">snapshot</span><a name="IDX-CHP-4-0341"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-4-0342"></a>. As the name might suggest, a snapshot, although it's derived, is real, not virtual—meaning it's represented not just by its definition in terms of other relvars but also, at least conceptually, by its own separate copy of the data. For example (to invent some syntax again):</p>
<pre>
    VAR LSS SNAPSHOT ( S WHERE CITY = 'London' )
        REFRESH EVERY DAY ;</pre><br>

<p class="docText">Defining a snapshot is just like executing a query, except that:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">The result of the query is saved in the database under the specified name (LSS in the example) as a read-only relvar (read-only, that is, apart from the periodic refresh; see the next bullet item).</p></li><li><p class="docList">Periodically (EVERY DAY in the example) the snapshot is refreshed—its current value is discarded, the query is executed again, and the result of that new execution becomes the new snapshot value.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">In the example, therefore, snapshot LSS represents the data as it was at most 24 hours ago.</p>
<p class="docText">Snapshots are important in data warehouses, distributed systems, and many other contexts. In all cases, the rationale is that many applications can tolerate, or might even require, data "as of " some particular point in time. Reporting and accounting applications are a case in point; such applications typically require the data to be frozen at an appropriate moment (for example, at the end of an accounting period), and snapshots allow such freezing to occur without locking out other applications.</P>
<p class="docText">So far, so good. The problem is that snapshots have come to be known (at least in some circles) not as snapshots at all but as <span class="docEmphasis">materialized views</span>. But snapshots <span class="docEmphasis">aren't</span> views! Indeed, the whole point about views, at least so far as the relational model is concerned, is that they <span class="docEmphasis">aren't</span> materialized; as we've seen, operations on views are implemented by mapping them into suitable operations on the underlying base relvars. Thus, "materialized view"<a name="IDX-CHP-4-0343"></a> is simply a contradiction in terms. Worse yet, the unqualified term <span class="docEmphasis">view</span> is now often taken to mean a "materialized view" specifically—again, at least in some circles—and so we're in danger of no longer having a good term to mean a view in the original sense. In this book, of course, I do use the term <span class="docEmphasis">view</span> in its original sense, but be warned that it doesn't always have that meaning elsewhere. <span class="docEmphasis">Caveat lector</span>.</p>
