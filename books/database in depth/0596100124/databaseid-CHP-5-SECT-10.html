<h3 class="docSection1Title" >Summary</h3>
<p class="docText">Almost inevitably, this has been the longest chapter in the book. Even so, I haven't covered "all known" algebraic operators, nor have I explained every last detail of the ones I did cover; but I hope I <span class="docEmphasis">have</span> covered enough to give you a good sense of what the algebra is all about. To review briefly, here's a list of the operators I did discuss: rename, restrict, project (including the ALL BUT form), join, semijoin (MATCHING), intersection, union, disjoint union (D_UNION), difference, semidifference (NOT MATCHING), product, divide, theta-join (including equijoin), extend, summarize, group, and ungroup. I also discussed certain nonalgebraic operators: relational comparisons, INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE (and relational assignment), and ORDER BY. Other topics I covered include:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Closure:</span> I explained the need for a set of relation type inference rules, so that we always know the type of the result of any given relational expression.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Primitive operators:</span> I showed that many of the operators are in fact shorthand for certain combinations of others. In particular, intersect and product are special cases of join, and difference is a special case of semidifference.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Join:</span> I also showed that—thanks to the fact that join is both commutative and associative—it was possible to define an <span class="docEmphasis">n</span>-adic or prefix version of the operator (where <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> is any integer greater than or equal to zero). The join of no relations at all is TABLE_DEE.</P></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">SQL expressions:</span> I gave a conceptual algorithm for evaluating SQL SELECT - FROM - WHERE expressions. I also suggested that the SELECT - FROM - WHERE template is sometimes too rigid.</p></li><LI><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Summaries versus aggregate operators:</span> I stressed the point (without getting into too much detail) that these are logically distinct constructs.</P></li><LI><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Expression transformation:</span> I briefly explained the distributive, commutative, and associative laws and described their role in optimization ("query rewrite").</P></LI><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">WITH:</span> I discussed the use of WITH in simplifying expression formulation by allowing names to be introduced for the results of subexpressions.</P></LI></UL>
