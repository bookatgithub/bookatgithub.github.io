<p class="docText">is a relation with (a) a heading derived from the heading of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> by removing all attributes not mentioned in the set {<span class="docEmphasis">X,Y, . . . ,Z</span>} and (b) a body consisting of all tuples {<span class="docEmphasis">X x,Y y, . . . ,Z z</span>} such that a tuple appears in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> with <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> value <span class="docEmphasis">x, Y</span> value <span class="docEmphasis">y, . . </span>., and <span class="docEmphasis">Z</span> value <span class="docEmphasis">z</span>.

<p class="docText">and:</P>

<p class="docText">are equivalent. This feature can save a lot of writing (think of projecting a relation of degree 100 on 99 of its attributes).

<p class="docText">In concrete syntax, it turns out to be convenient to assign high precedence to the projection operator. In <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span>, for example, we take this expression:</P>

<pre>
  <span class="docEmphasis">
  r</span> JOIN <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">is a relation with (a) a heading that is the (set-theoretic) union of the headings of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> and (b) a body consisting of the set of all tuples <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> such that <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> is the (set-theoretic) union of a tuple appearing in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and a tuple appearing in <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>. In other words, the heading is {<span class="docEmphasis">X,Y,Z</span>} and the body consists of all tuples {<span class="docEmphasis">X x,Y y,Z z</span>} such that a tuple appears in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> with <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> value <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">Y</span> value <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> and a tuple appears in <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> with <span class="docEmphasis">Y</span> value <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">Z</span> value <span class="docEmphasis">z</span>. Here again is the example from the introductory section:</p>
<pre>
  P JOIN S  | SELECT P.PNO, P.PNAME, P.COLOR, P.WEIGHT, P.CITY,
            |        S.SNO, S.SNAME, S.STATUS
            | FROM   P, S
            | WHERE  P.CITY = S.CITY
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">Now, I'm quite sure you were already familiar with what I've said so far regarding join, but you might not be so familiar with the following points. First of all, I remind you that the SQL standard allows the join of parts and suppliers on cities to be expressed in an alternative style that's a little closer to that of <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> (and this time I deliberately replace that long list of column references in the SELECT clause by a simple "*"):</P>
<pre>
  SELECT *
  FROM   P NATURAL JOIN S
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">However, not all SQL products actually support this syntax.</P>
<p class="docText">Second, and more important, <span class="docEmphasis">intersection</span> is a special case of join. To be specific, if <span class="docEmphasis">m</span> = <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> = 0 (meaning there are no <span class="docEmphasis">X</span>'s and no <span class="docEmphasis">Z</span>'s, and <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> are thus of the same type), <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> JOIN <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> degenerates to <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> INTERSECT<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0388"></a> <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> (see the next subsection "<a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-2.4">Intersect</a>").</p>
<p class="docText">Third (also important), <span class="docEmphasis">cartesian product</span><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0389"></a> is a special case of join, too: if <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> = 0, meaning there are no <span class="docEmphasis">Y</span>'s and <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> thus have no common attributes at all, <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> JOIN <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> degenerates to <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> TIMES<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0390"></a> <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> (see the later subsection "<a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-2.7">Cartesian Product</a>"). Why? Because (a) the set of attributes common to <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> in this case is the <span class="docEmphasis">empty</span> set of attributes; (b) every possible tuple has the same value for the empty set of attributes (namely, the 0-tuple); thus, (c) every tuple in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> joins to every tuple in <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>, and so we get the cartesian product as stated.</P>
<p class="docText">Fourth, it turns out in practice that many queries that require join really require an extended form of that operator called <span class="docEmphasis">semijoin</span><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0391"></a>. (You might not have heard of semijoin before, but in fact it's quite important.) Here's the definition: the <span class="docEmphasis">semijoin</span> of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> with <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> is the join of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>, projected back on to the attributes of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>. By way of example, consider the query "Get suppliers who supply at least one part":</P>
<pre>
  S SEMIJOIN SP  | SELECT DISTINCT S.*
                 | FROM   S, SP
                 | WHERE  S.SNO = SP.SNO
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">As you can see, this query can be thought of as asking for just those suppliers that match at least one shipment. <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> therefore provides a more user-friendly spelling for SEMIJOIN that allows the query to be expressed thus:</P>
<pre>
  S MATCHING SP
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">Now observe what happens to <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> JOIN <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> if <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> = 0 (meaning the heading of <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> is a subset of that of <span class="docEmphasis">r--</span> equivalently, every attribute of <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> is an attribute of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>). As I hope you can see, <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> JOIN <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> degenerates to <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> MATCHING <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> in this case. Likewise, if <span class="docEmphasis">m</span> = 0, <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> JOIN <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> degenerates to <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> MATCHING <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> (note that <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> MATCHING <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> MATCHING <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> are different, in general).</p>
<p class="docText">Fifth, join is fundamentally a <span class="docEmphasis">dyadic</span> operator, meaning it takes two operands. However, it's possible, and useful, to support an <span class="docEmphasis">n</span>-adic or prefix version of the operator (and <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> does), according to which we can write expressions of the form:</p>
<pre>
  JOIN { <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>, ..., <span class="docEmphasis">w</span> }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">to join any number of relations <span class="docEmphasis">r, s, . . . ,w</span>. For example, the join of parts and suppliers could alternatively be expressed as follows:</p>
<pre>
  JOIN { P, S }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">What's more, we can use this syntax to ask for "joins" of just a single relation, or even of no relations at all! The join of a single relation, JOIN{<span class="docEmphasis">r</span>}, is just <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> itself; this case is perhaps not of much practical importance. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the join of no relations at all, JOIN{}, is very important indeed!—and the result is TABLE_DEE<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0392"></a>. (Recall that TABLE_DEE is the unique relation with no attributes and one tuple.) Why is the result TABLE_DEE? Well, consider the following:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">In ordinary arithmetic, 0 is the <span class="docEmphasis">identity</span> with respect to "+"; that is, for all numbers <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>, the expressions <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> + 0 and 0 + <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> are both identically equal to <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>. As a consequence, <span class="docEmphasis">the sum of no numbers is 0</span>. (To see that this claim is reasonable, consider a piece of code that computes the sum of <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> numbers by initializing the sum to 0 and then iterating over those <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> numbers. What happens if <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> = 0?)</p></li><li><p class="docList">In like manner, 1 is the identity with respect to "*"; that is, for all numbers <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>, the expressions <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> * 1 and 1 * <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> are both identically equal to <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>. As a consequence, the product of no numbers is 1.</p></li><LI><p class="docList">In the relational algebra, <span class="docEmphasis">TABLE_DEE is the identity with respect to JOIN;</span> that is, the join of any relation <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> with TABLE_DEE is simply <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>. As a consequence, the join of no relations is TABLE_DEE.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">If you're having difficulty with this idea, don't worry about it too much for now. But if you come back to reread this section later, I suggest you try to convince yourself then that <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> JOIN TABLE_DEE and TABLE_DEE JOIN <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> are indeed both identically equal to <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>. It might help if I point out that the joins in question are actually cartesian products (right?).</p>

<p class="docText">Let relations <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> be of the same type. Then the <span class="docEmphasis">intersection</span> of those relations, <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> INTERSECT <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>, is a relation of the same type, with a body consisting of all tuples <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> such that <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> appears in both <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>.

<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0396"></a>
<p class="docText">Again, let relations <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> be of the same type. Then the <span class="docEmphasis">union</span> of those relations, <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> UNION<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0397"></a> <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>, is a relation of the same type, with a body consisting of all tuples <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> such that <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> appears in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> or both. For example:</P>
<pre>
  S { CITY } UNION P { CITY }  | SELECT DISTINCT S.CITY
                               | FROM   S
                               | UNION  DISTINCT
                               | SELECT DISTINCT P.CITY
                               | FROM   P
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">As with projection, it's worth noting explicitly in connection with union that "duplicates are eliminated." In the SQL version, however, that DISTINCT after the keyword UNION is <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> strictly needed; although UNION provides the same options as SELECT does (DISTINCT versus ALL), the default for UNION is DISTINCT, not ALL. (It's the other way around for SELECT, as you'll recall from <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-3.html#databaseid-CHP-3">Chapter 3</a>.) As a consequence, the DISTINCTs following the two SELECTs aren't needed, either, though of course they're not wrong. Analogous remarks apply to intersection (also to difference, which we'll get to in a moment).</P>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> also supports <span class="docEmphasis">disjoint<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0398"></a> union</span> (D_UNION), a version of union that requires its operands to be disjoint, which means they have no tuples in common. For example:</P>
<pre>
  S { CITY } D_UNION P { CITY }
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">Given our usual sample data, this expression will produce a runtime error because supplier cities and part cities aren't disjoint. An SQL counterpart might look like this:</p>
<pre>
  SELECT *
  FROM ( SELECT S.CITY FROM S
         UNION
         SELECT P.CITY FROM P ) AS <span class="docEmphasis">POINTLESS</span>
  WHERE  NOT EXISTS
       ( SELECT S.CITY FROM S
         INTERSECT
         SELECT P.CITY FROM P )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">There's a difference<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0399"></a>, though: if supplier cities and part cities aren't disjoint, the SQL expression won't fail at run time, but will simply return an empty result.

<p class="docText">Recall now that there's an operator related to join called semijoin.

<p class="docText">To see that regular difference is a special case of semidifference, consider what happens if <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> are of the same type (I'll leave the details as an exercise).</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Cartesian Product</h4>
<p class="docText">I include this operator mainly for completeness; as we've seen, it's really just a special case of join, and as a matter of fact <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> doesn't support it directly—but let's suppose it did, just for the sake of discussion. Clearly, then, the operands must have no common attribute names (what would happen otherwise?), and the result heading is the set-theoretic union of the input headings. Here's an example:</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Divide</h4>
<p class="docText">As promised in the introduction to this chapter, I'll give a precise definition of this operator here, but for several reasons I don't want to discuss it in much detail. The most important of those reasons is that any query that can be formulated in terms of divide<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0406"></a> can alternatively, and I think more simply, be formulated in terms of <span class="docEmphasis">relational comparisons</span> (I'll discuss relational comparisons later in this chapter). You might therefore want to skip the following discussion, at least on a first reading.</p>
<p class="docText">Another reason I don't want to get into too much detail is that there are several different "divide" operators anyway! That is, there are, unfortunately, several different operators all called "divide," and I certainly don't want to explain all of them. Instead, I'll limit my attention here to the original and simplest one, which can be defined as follows. Let relations <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> be such that the heading of <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> is a subset of the heading of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>. Then the <span class="docEmphasis">division</span> of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> by <span class="docEmphasis">s, r</span> DIVIDEBY<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0407"></a> <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>,<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-5">[*]</a></sup> is shorthand for the following:</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-5">[*]</a></sup> <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> doesn't directly support "the original and simplest" divide, and this is thus not valid <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> syntax.</p></blockquote>
<pre>
  <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> { <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> } MINUS ( ( <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> { <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> } TIMES <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> ) MINUS <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> ) { <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">X</span> here is the (set-theoretic) difference between the heading of <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and that of <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>. Thus, for example, the expression:</p>
<pre>
  SP { SNO, PNO } DIVIDEBY P { PNO }
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">(given our usual sample data values) yields:</p>

<p class="docText">(loosely, supplier numbers for suppliers who supply all parts; I'll explain the reason for that qualifier "loosely" in the section "<a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-7.html#databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-7">Relational Comparisons</a>," later in this chapter). Here's an SQL analog:</p>

  SELECT DISTINCT SPX.SNO
  FROM   SP AS SPX
  WHERE  NOT EXISTS
     ( SELECT P.PNO
       FROM   P

        ( SELECT SPY.SNO
          FROM   SP AS SPY
          WHERE  SPY.SNO = SPX.SNO
          AND  SPY.PNO = P.PNO ) )
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">By the way, have you ever wondered why divide is called divide? The reason is that if <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> are relations with no common attributes, and we form the cartesian product <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> TIMES <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> and then divide the result by <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>, we get back to <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>;<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-6">[*]</a></sup> in other words, cartesian product and divide are inverses of each other, in a sense.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-6">[*]</a></sup> So long as <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> isn't empty. What happens if it is?</P></blockquote>

<p class="docText">As I've more or less said already, not all of the operators we've been discussing are primitive—several of them can be defined in terms of others. One possible primitive set (not the only one) is that consisting of restrict, project, join, union, and semidifference. <span class="docEmphasis">Note:</span> You might be surprised not to see rename in this list. In fact, however, rename isn't primitive, though I haven't covered enough groundwork yet to show why not. What this example shows, however, is that there's a difference between being primitive and being useful! I certainly wouldn't want to be without our useful rename operator, even if it isn't primitive.</P>
