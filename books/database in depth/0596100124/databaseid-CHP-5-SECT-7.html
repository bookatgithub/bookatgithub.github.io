<p class="docText">In <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-2.html#databaseid-CHP-2">Chapter 2</a>, I mentioned the fact that the equality comparison operator "=" applies to every type. In particular, therefore, it applies to <span class="docEmphasis">relation</span> types; that is, given two relations <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> of the same relation type <span class="docEmphasis">T</span>, we must at least be able to test whether those two relations are equal. Other comparisons might be useful, too; for example, we might want to test whether <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> is a subset<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0435"></a> of <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> (meaning every tuple in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> is also in <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>), or whether <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> is a <span class="docEmphasis">proper</span> subset of <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> (meaning every tuple in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> is also in <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>, but <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> contains at least one tuple that isn't in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>).</p>
<p class="docText">Now, I must immediately explain that these operators aren't relational operators as such—that is, they're not part of the relational algebra—because their result is a truth value, not a relation. But it's convenient to discuss them in this chapter, and I will. Here's a simple example:</p>
<pre>
  S { CITY } = P { CITY }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">The left comparand is the projection of suppliers on CITY, the right comparand is the projection of parts on CITY, and the comparison returns TRUE if these two projections are equal, FALSE otherwise. In other words, the comparison (which is, of course, a boolean expression) means: "Is the set of supplier cities equal to the set of part cities?"</p>
<p class="docText">Here's another example:</p>
<pre>
  S { SNO } <img src=images/ent/U2283.GIF border=0> SP { SNO }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Explanation:</span> The symbol "<img src=images/ent/U2283.GIF border=0>" here means "is a proper superset<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0436"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0437"></a> of." The meaning of this comparison (considerably paraphrased) is: "Are there any suppliers who supply no parts at all?"</p>
<p class="docText">Other useful relational comparison operators include "<img src=images/ent/U2287.GIF border=0>" ("is a superset of"), "<img src=images/ent/U2286.GIF border=0>" ("is a subset of"), and "<img src=images/ent/U2282.GIF border=0>" ("is a proper subset<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0438"></a> of").</p>
<p class="docText">The obvious place where relational comparisons are useful is in connection with restrictions.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-12">[*]</a></sup> Let's look at some examples. Consider first the query "Get suppliers who supply all parts." Here's a possible formulation:</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-12">[*]</a></sup> But see <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-11.html#databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-11.1.26">Exercise 5-26</a> at the end of the chapter.</P></blockquote>
<pre>
  WITH<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0439"></a> ( SP RENAME ( SNO AS X ) ) AS R :
       S WHERE ( R WHERE X = SNO ) { PNO } = P { PNO }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Explanation:</span> The expression WITH . . . AS R is effectively equivalent to an assignment that assigns the value of the expression SP RENAME (SNO AS X) to some temporary, system-generated relvar R; after that assignment, the value of R is a relation that's identical to the current value of relvar SP, except that attribute SNO has been renamed as X.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-13">[<img src=images/ent/U2020.GIF border=0>]</a></sup> (The purpose of introducing the names R and X is simply to avoid a naming conflict that would subsequently arise otherwise.) Then, for a given supplier S <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>,say, in relvar S, the expression:</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-13">[<img src=images/ent/U2020.GIF border=0>]</a></sup> SQL supports WITH too, though it writes the operands the other way around: WITH <span class="docEmphasis">name</span> AS <span class="docEmphasis">expression</span>.</p></blockquote>
<pre>
  ( R WHERE X = SNO ) { PNO }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">evaluates to a relation with one attribute (PNO), giving part numbers for all parts supplied by supplier S <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>. Note in particular that if supplier S <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> supplies no parts, that relation will contain no tuples. Finally, that degree-one relation is tested for equality with the relation that's the projection of P on PNO. Clearly, that test will give TRUE if and only if the set of part numbers for parts supplied by S <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> is equal to the set of part numbers in relvar P. The overall result thus contains precisely those tuples from relvar S that represent suppliers who supply all of the parts mentioned in relvar P.</P>
<p class="docText">Of course, we can write the entire query as a single expression if we like:</P>
<pre>
  S WHERE ( ( SP RENAME ( SNO AS X ) ) WHERE X = SNO ) { PNO } = P { PNO }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">But using WITH to introduce names for the results of subexpressions often helps to simplify the job of formulating complicated queries. Here's a definition: if <span class="docEmphasis">rx</span> is a relational expression that mentions some relvar <span class="docEmphasis">R</span>, then WITH <span class="docEmphasis">ry</span> AS <span class="docEmphasis">R: rx</span>, where <span class="docEmphasis">ry</span> is another relational expression, is also a relational expression. Of course, <span class="docEmphasis">rx</span> might be a WITH expression, too, like this:</P>
<pre>
  WITH <span class="docEmphasis">ry</span> AS <span class="docEmphasis">R1</span> : WITH <span class="docEmphasis">rz</span> AS <span class="docEmphasis">R2</span> : <span class="docEmphasis">rx</span>
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">This latter expression can be abbreviated to just:</P>
<pre>
  WITH <span class="docEmphasis">ry</span> AS <span class="docEmphasis">R1</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">rz</span> AS <span class="docEmphasis">R2</span> : <span class="docEmphasis">rx</span>
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">We'll see plenty of examples of this abbreviated form later.</P>
<p class="docText">By the way, the foregoing example ("Get suppliers who supply all parts") is very similar to one that's often used to illustrate the use of the relational divide operator. To be specific, the expression:</P>
<pre>
  SP { SNO, PNO } DIVIDEBY P { PNO }
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">(which I gave as an example of divide in the earlier section "<a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-2.html#databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-2">The Original Operators</a>") is often characterized as a relational formulation of the query "Get supplier numbers for suppliers who supply all parts." But it isn't! Rather, it is a relational formulation of the query "Get supplier numbers for suppliers who <span class="docEmphasis">supply at least one part and in fact</span> supply all parts." (If you're wondering what the logical difference is here, see <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-11.html#databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-11.1.25">Exercise 5-25</a> at the end of this chapter.) In my opinion, the formulation involving a relational comparison is not only easier to understand than the divide formulation—it also has the advantage of being <span class="docEmphasis">correct</span>.</P>
<p class="docText">Here's another example. The query is: "Get pairs of supplier numbers, S <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> and S <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> say, such that S <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> and S <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> supply exactly the same set of parts each." This query is very difficult without relational comparisons! Here it is:</P>
<pre>
  WITH ( SP RENAME ( SNO AS SX ) ) { SX, PNO } AS R1 ,
     ( SP RENAME ( SNO AS SY ) ) { SY, PNO } AS R2 ,
     R1 { SX } AS R3 ,
     R2 { SY } AS R4 ,
     ( R1 JOIN R4 ) AS R5 ,
     ( R2 JOIN R3 ) AS R6 ,
     ( R1 JOIN R2 ) AS R7 ,
     ( R3 JOIN R4 ) AS R8 ,
     SP { PNO } AS R9 ,
     ( R8 JOIN R9 ) AS R10 ,
     ( R10 MINUS R7 ) AS R11 ,
     ( R6 JOIN R11 ) AS R12 ,
     ( R5 JOIN R11 ) AS R13 ,
     R12 { SX, SY } AS R14 ,
     R13 { SX, SY } AS R15 ,
     ( R14 UNION R15 ) AS R16 ,
     R7 { SX, SY } AS R17 :
  R17 MINUS R16
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">But with relational comparisons it's fairly straightforward:</p>
<pre>
  WITH ( S RENAME ( SNO AS SX ) ) { SX } AS RX ,
     ( S RENAME ( SNO AS SY ) ) { SY } AS RY :
  ( RX JOIN RY ) WHERE ( SP WHERE SNO = SX ) { PNO } =
             ( SP WHERE SNO = SY ) { PNO }
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">As an aside, I remark that appending "AND SX &lt; SY" to the WHERE clause here would produce a slightly tidier result; to be specific, it would (a) eliminate pairs of the form (S <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>,S<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>) and (b) ensure that the pairs (S<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>,S<span class="docEmphasis">y</span>) and (S<span class="docEmphasis">y</span>,S<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>) don't both appear.</P>
<p class="docText">One particular comparison that's often needed in practice is an "=" comparison between a given relation <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> and an empty relation of the same type—in other words, a test to see whether <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> is empty. So let me introduce the following shorthand:</P>
<pre>
  IS_EMPTY<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0440"></a> ( <span class="docEmphasis">rx</span> )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">This expression is defined to return TRUE if the relation <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> denoted by the relational expression <span class="docEmphasis">rx</span> is empty and FALSE otherwise. I'll be relying heavily on this construct in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="docText">Another common requirement is to be able to test whether a given tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> appears in a given relation <span class="docEmphasis">r:</span></p>
<pre>
  <span class="docEmphasis">
  t</span> <img src=images/ent/U220A.GIF border=0><span class="docEmphasis">rx</span>
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">This expression is defined to be shorthand for the relational comparison:</P>
<pre>
  RELATION { <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> } <img src=images/ent/U2286.GIF border=0> <span class="docEmphasis">rx</span>
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">The left operand here is a relation selector invocation, and it returns a relation containing just the specified tuple <span class="docEmphasis">t</span>. The comparison thus returns TRUE if <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> appears in the relation <span class="docEmphasis">r</span> denoted by the relational expression <span class="docEmphasis">rx</span> and FALSE otherwise ("<img src=images/ent/U220A.GIF border=0>" is the <span class="docEmphasis">set membership</span><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0441"></a> operator; the expression <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> <img src=images/ent/U220A.GIF border=0><span class="docEmphasis">r</span> can be read as "<span class="docEmphasis">t</span>[appears] in <span class="docEmphasis">r</span>"). In fact, as you've probably realized, the "<img src=images/ent/U220A.GIF border=0>" operator is essentially SQL's IN operator—except that the left operand of SQL's IN is usually a scalar, not a row, which means there's some kind of coercion<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0442"></a> going on. Be that as it may, SQL certainly doesn't support any relational comparisons apart from this one rather special one. (Well, it does support NOT IN; so does <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span>, in the form of "<img src=images/ent/U2209.GIF border=0>".)</P>
