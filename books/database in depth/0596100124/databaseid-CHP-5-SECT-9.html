<p class="docText">The last topic I want to address in this chapter is ORDER<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0449"></a> BY. ORDER BY<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0450"></a> is yet another operator that's not part of the relational algebra; as I pointed out in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a>, in fact, it isn't a relational operator at all, because it produces a result that isn't a relation (it does take a relation as input, but it produces something else—namely, a <span class="docEmphasis">sequence of tuples—</span> as output). Of course, I'm not saying ORDER BY isn't useful; however, I <span class="docEmphasis">am</span> saying it can't legally or sensibly appear in a relational expression.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-14">[*]</a></sup> By definition, therefore, the following expressions, though legal, aren't relational expressions as such:</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-14">[*]</a></sup> In particular, therefore, it can't appear in a view definition—despite the fact that at least one well-known product allows it to!</p></blockquote>
<pre>
  S MATCHING SP        | SELECT DISTINCT S.*
    ORDER ( ASC SNO )  | FROM   S, SP
                       | WHERE  S.SNO = SP.SNO
                       | ORDER  BY S.SNO ASC
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">That said, I'd like to point out that for a couple of reasons ORDER BY (just ORDER, in <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span>) is actually a rather strange operator. First, it effectively works by sorting tuples into some specified sequence—and yet "&lt;" and "&gt;" aren't defined for tuples (see <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-3-SECT-9.html#databaseid-CHP-3-SECT-9.1.11">Exercise 3-11</a> in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-3.html#databaseid-CHP-3">Chapter 3</a>). Second, it's not a <span class="docEmphasis">function</span>. All of the operators of the relational algebra—in fact, all read-only operators, in the usual sense of that term—<span class="docEmphasis">are</span> functions, meaning there's always just one possible output for any given input. By contrast, ORDER BY can produce several different outputs from the same input. As an illustration of this point, consider the effect of the operation ORDER BY CITY on our usual suppliers relation. Clearly, this operation can return any of four distinct results, corresponding to the following sequences (I'll show just the supplier numbers, for simplicity):</p>
<pre>
  S5, S1, S4, S2, S3

  S5, S4, S1, S2, S3

  S5, S1, S4, S3, S2

  S5, S4, S1, S3, S2
</pre><br>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">A note on SQL:</span> It would be remiss of me not to mention in passing that most of the algebraic operators have analogs in SQL that also aren't functions. This state of affairs is due to the fact that, as indicated in the exercises in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-2.html#databaseid-CHP-2">Chapter 2</a>, SQL allows the comparison <span class="docEmphasis">v1</span> = <span class="docEmphasis">v2</span> to evaluate to TRUE even if <span class="docEmphasis">v1</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">v2</span> are distinct. For example, consider the character strings 'Paris' and 'Paris ', respectively (note the trailing space in the latter); these values are clearly distinct, and yet SQL sometimes regards them as equal. As a consequence, certain queries give what the standard calls "possibly nondeterministic results." Here's a simple example:</p>
<pre>
  SELECT DISTINCT S.CITY FROM S
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">If one supplier has CITY value 'Paris' and Paris 'another ', then the result will include either or both of 'Paris' and 'Paris ', but which result we get might be undefined. We could even legitimately get one result on one day and another on another, even if the database hasn't changed at all in the interim. You might like to meditate on some of the implications of this state of affairs.</p>
