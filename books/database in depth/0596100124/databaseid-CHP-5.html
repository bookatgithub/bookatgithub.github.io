<h2 class="docChapterTitle">Chapter Five. Relational Algebra</h2>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">I'll begin this chapter by briefly reviewing a few important points from <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a></span>. First, I remind you that each algebraic operator takes at least one relation as input and produces another relation as output. Second, I remind you that the fact that the output is the same kind of thing as the input—they're all relations—is the <span class="docEmphasis">closure</span><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0374"></a> property of the algebra, and it's that property that lets us write nested relational expressions. Third, I gave outline descriptions in <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">Chapter 1</a> of what I called "<a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-1.html#databaseid-CHP-1">the original eight operators</a>" (restrict, project, product, intersect, union, difference, join, and divide); now I want to define those operators, as well as a number of others, much more carefully. Before I can do so, however, I need to make a few general points:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">First, the operators are <span class="docEmphasis">generic</span>: they apply, in effect, to <span class="docEmphasis">all possible relations</span>. For example, we don't need one specific join operator to join employees and departments and another, different, join operator to join suppliers and shipments. (Incidentally, do you think an analogous observation applies to object-oriented systems?)</p></li><li><p class="docList">Second, the operators are <span class="docEmphasis">read-only</span>: they "read" their operands and return a result, but they don't update anything. In other words, they operate on <span class="docEmphasis">relations</span>, not <span class="docEmphasis">relvars</span>.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Of course, the previous point doesn't mean that relational expressions can't refer to relvars. For example, <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> UNION <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>, where <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> are relvar names, is certainly a valid relational expression in <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span>. In the context of such an expression, however, a relvar name doesn't denote the corresponding relvar as such; rather, it denotes the relation that happens to be the current value of that relvar at that time. In other words, we can certainly use a relvar name to denote a relation operand, and such a <span class="docEmphasis">relvar reference</span> thus constitutes a valid relational expression<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-1">[*]</a></sup>—but in principle we could equally well denote the very same operand by means of an appropriate relation literal instead. (An analogy might help clarify this point. Suppose N is a variable of type INTEGER, and at time <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> it has the value 3. Then N+2 is certainly a valid expression, but at time <span class="docEmphasis">t</span> it means exactly the same as 3+2, no more and no less.)</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-1">[*]</a></sup> Not in SQL, though! For example, if <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> are SQL table names, we typically can't write things like <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> UNION <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>; instead, we have to write something like SELECT <span class="docEmphasis">R</span>.* FROM <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> UNION SELECT <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>.* FROM <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p class="docList">Last, given that the operators of the algebra are all read-only, it follows that INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE (and relational assignment), though they <span class="docEmphasis">are</span> relational operators, aren't part of the algebra as such.</p></LI></UL>
<p class="docText">I also need to say something about the design of <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span>, because its support for the algebra differs in certain significant respects from that of SQL (perhaps it would be more accurate to say that its support for the algebra is—deliberately, of course—much more direct than that of SQL). The overriding point is that, in operations such as UNION or JOIN that need some correspondence to be established between operand attributes, <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> does so by requiring the attributes in question <span class="docEmphasis">to have the same names</span> (as well as, necessarily, the same types). For example, here's a <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> expression for the join of parts and suppliers on cities:</p>
<pre>
  P JOIN S
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">By definition, this join is performed on the basis of part and supplier cities, P and S having just the CITY attribute in common. Here by contrast is the same operation in SQL (note the last line in particular):</P>
<pre>
  SELECT P.PNO, P.PNAME, P.COLOR, P.WEIGHT, P.CITY,
       S.SNO, S.SNAME, S.STATUS
  FROM   P,S
  WHERE  P.CITY = S.CITY
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Note</span>: Actually, this example can be formulated in many different ways in SQL, and here are three more. As you'll observe, the second and third are a little closer to the spirit of <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> (note in particular that the result of the join in those two formulations has a column called just CITY and <span class="docEmphasis">no</span> columns called either S.CITY or P.CITY):</p>
<pre>
  SELECT P.PNO, P.PNAME, P.COLOR, P.WEIGHT, P.CITY,
       S.SNO, S.SNAME, S.STATUS
  FROM   P JOIN S
  ON   P.CITY = S.CITY

  SELECT P.PNO, P.PNAME, P.COLOR, P.WEIGHT, CITY,
       S.SNO, S.SNAME, S.STATUS
  FROM   P JOIN S
  USING  ( CITY )

  SELECT P.PNO, P.PNAME, P.COLOR, P.WEIGHT, CITY,
       S.SNO, S.SNAME, S.STATUS
  FROM   P NATURAL JOIN S
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">I chose the particular formulation I did partly because it was the only one supported in SQL as originally defined and partly, and more importantly, because it allows me to make a number of additional points concerning differences between SQL and the algebra (at least as realized in <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span>):</P>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">SQL permits (and sometimes requires) dot-qualified names. <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> doesn't.</P></LI><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> sometimes needs to rename attributes in order to avoid what would otherwise be naming clashes or mismatches. SQL usually doesn't (though it does support an analog of the RENAME operator that <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> uses for the purpose, as we'll see in the next section).</p></LI><LI><p class="docList">Partly as a consequence of the previous point, <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> has no need for SQL's "correlation names" (in effect, it replaces SQL's correlation-name concept by the idea that attributes occasionally need to be renamed in order to "disambiguate" what would otherwise be a syntactically invalid expression).</p></li><li><p class="docList">In addition to either explicitly or implicitly supporting certain features of the relational algebra, SQL also explicitly supports certain features of the relational <span class="docEmphasis">calculus</span> (EXISTS is a case in point—see Appendix A). <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> doesn't. One consequence of this difference is that SQL tends to be a rather redundant language, in that it often provides numerous different ways of formulating the same query (a fact that can have serious negative implications for the optimizer).<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-2">[*]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-5-FNOTE-2">[*]</a></sup> I once wrote a paper on this topic called "Fifty Ways to Quote Your Query" (<span class="docEmphasis">www.dbpd.com</span>, July 1998), in which I showed that even a query as simple as "Get names of suppliers who supply part P2" can be expressed in well over 50 different ways in SQL.</P></blockquote></li><LI><p class="docList">SQL requires most queries to conform to its SELECT - FROM - WHERE template. <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> has no analogous requirement. I'll have more to say on this particular issue in the section <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-4.html#databaseid-CHP-5-SECT-4">Extend and Summarize</a>," later in this chapter.</p></LI></UL>
<p class="docText">In what follows, I'll show most examples in both <span class="docEmphStrong">Tutorial D</span> and SQL.</P>
