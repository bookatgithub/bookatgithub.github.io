<p class="docText">Recall from <a class="docLink" href="databaseid-CHP-4.html#databaseid-CHP-4">Chapter 4</a> that the relvar predicate for a relvar is <span class="docEmphasis">the intended interpretation</span>듧oosely, the <span class="docEmphasis">meaning</span>듡or that relvar. For example, the predicate for relvar S looks like this:</p>
<blockquote><p class="docText">Supplier SNO is under contract, is named SNAME, has status STATUS, and is located in city CITY.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">In an ideal world, therefore, this predicate would serve as the criterion for acceptability of updates on relvar S듮hat is, it would dictate whether a given INSERT or DELETE or UPDATE operation on that relvar can be accepted. But this goal is clearly unachievable:</p>
<UL><li><p class="docList">For one thing, the system can't know what it means for a "supplier" to be "under contract" or to be "located" somewhere; to repeat, these are matters of interpretation. For example, if the supplier number S1 and the city name London happen to appear together in the same tuple, then the user can interpret that fact to mean that supplier S1 is located in London,<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-6-FNOTE-7">[*]</a></sup> but there's no way the system can do anything analogous.</P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-6-FNOTE-7">[*]</a></sup> Or that supplier S1 <span class="docEmphasis">used to be</span> located in London, or that supplier S1 <span class="docEmphasis">has an office</span> in London, or that supplier S1 <span class="docEmphasis">doesn't</span> have an office in London, or any of an infinite number of other possible interpretations (corresponding, of course, to an infinite number of possible predicates).</p></blockquote></LI><LI><p class="docList">For another, even if the system could know what it means for a supplier to be under contract or to be located somewhere, it still couldn't know <span class="docEmphasis">a priori</span> whether what the user tells it is true! If the user asserts to the system, by means of some update, that there's a supplier S6 named Lopez with status 30 and city Madrid, there's no way for the system to know whether that assertion is true. All the system can do is check that the user's assertion doesn't violate any integrity constraints. Assuming it doesn't, then the system will accept the user's assertion <span class="docEmphasis">and will treat it as true from that point forward</span> (until such time as the user tells the system, by executing another update, that it isn't true anymore).</P></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">Thus, the <span class="docEmphasis">pragmatic</span> "criterion for acceptability of updates," as opposed to the ideal one, is not the predicate but the corresponding set of constraints, which might thus be regarded as the system's approximation to the predicate.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-6-FNOTE-8">[*]</a></sup> Equivalently:</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-6-FNOTE-8">[*]</a></sup> Precisely for this reason, I've elsewhere used the term <i>internal predicate</i> to refer to constraints and the term <i>external predicate</i> to refer to what I'm here calling the relvar predicate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText">The system can't enforce truth, only consistency.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">In other words: the system can't guarantee that the database contains only true propositions들t can guarantee only that it doesn't contain anything that violates any constraint (meaning it contains no inconsistencies). Sadly, truth and consistency aren't the same thing. To be specific:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">If the database contains only true propositions, then it's consistent, but the converse isn't necessarily so.</p></li><li><p class="docList">If the database is inconsistent, then it contains at least one false proposition, but the converse isn't necessarily so.</P></li></ul>
<p class="docText">More succinctly, <span class="docEmphasis">correct</span> implies <span class="docEmphasis">consistent</span> (but not the other way around), and <span class="docEmphasis">inconsistent</span> implies <span class="docEmphasis">incorrect</span> (but not the other way around)등here to say that the database is <span class="docEmphasis">correct</span> is to say it faithfully reflects the true state of affairs in the real world, no more and no less.</p>
<p class="docText">Now let me try to pin down these notions a little more precisely. Let <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> be a base relvar듈'll get to views in just a moment드nd let <span class="docEmphasis">C1, C2, . . . , Cn</span> be all of the defined database constraints, single- or multi-relvar, that mention <span class="docEmphasis">R</span>. Assume for simplicity that each <span class="docEmphasis">Ci</span> is just a boolean expression (in other words, let's ignore the constraint names, for simplicity). Then the boolean expression:</p>
<pre>
  ( <span class="docEmphasis">C1</span> ) AND ( <span class="docEmphasis">C2</span> ) AND ... AND ( <span class="docEmphasis">Cn</span> ) AND TRUE
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">is <span class="docEmphasis">the total relvar constraint</span> for relvar <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> (but I'll refer to it for the purposes of this book as just <span class="docEmphasis">the</span> constraint for <span class="docEmphasis">R</span>). Note that final "AND TRUE," by the way; the implication is that if no constraints are defined for a given relvar, the default is just TRUE.</P>
<p class="docText">Now let <span class="docEmphasis">RC</span> be "the" relvar constraint for relvar <span class="docEmphasis">R</span>. Clearly, <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> must never be allowed to have a value that causes <span class="docEmphasis">RC</span> to evaluate to FALSE. This state of affairs is the motivation for (the first version of) what I like to call <span class="docEmphasis">The Golden Rule</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p class="docText">No update operation must ever cause any relvar constraint to evaluate to FALSE.</P></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Now let <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> be a view. Then <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> too has a "total relvar constraint" (which I'll usually abbreviate to just <span class="docEmphasis">the</span> constraint for <span class="docEmphasis">V</span>, for simplicity), derived in an obvious manner from the constraints that apply to the relvars in terms of which <span class="docEmphasis">V</span> is defined. For example, let <span class="docEmphasis">SC</span> be the total constraint for base relvar S. Then the total constraint for view LS ("London suppliers") is:</P>
<pre>
  ( <span class="docEmphasis">SC</span> ) AND ( CITY = 'London' )
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">Now let <span class="docEmphasis">DB</span> be a database, and let <span class="docEmphasis">DB</span> contain relvars <span class="docEmphasis">R1, R2, . . . , Rn</span> (only). Let the constraints for those relvars be <span class="docEmphasis">RC1, RC2, . . . , RCn</span>, respectively. Then <span class="docEmphasis">the total database constraint</span> for <span class="docEmphasis">DB, DBC</span> say등hich I'll refer to for the purposes of this book as just <span class="docEmphasis">the</span> constraint for <span class="docEmphasis">DB</span>들s the AND of all of those relvar constraints:</p>
<pre>
  ( <span class="docEmphasis">RC1</span> ) AND ( <span class="docEmphasis">RC2</span> ) AND ... AND ( <span class="docEmphasis">RCn</span> )
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">And here's a correspondingly extended (in fact, the final) version of <span class="docEmphasis">The Golden Rule</span>:</P>
<blockquote><p class="docText">No update operation must ever cause any database constraint to evaluate to FALSE.</P></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Observe in particular that들n accordance with my position that all integrity checking must be immediate듮he rule talks in terms of update operations, not transactions.</P>
<p class="docText">Now I can take care of a piece of unfinished business. I've said we can never trust the answers we get from an inconsistent database. Here's the proof. As we know, a database can be regarded as a collection of propositions. Suppose that collection is inconsistent; that is, suppose it implies that both <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> and NOT <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> are true, where <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> is some proposition. Now let <span class="docEmphasis">q</span> be any arbitrary proposition. Then:</P>
<UL><li><p class="docList">From the truth of <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>, we can infer the truth of <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> OR <span class="docEmphasis">q</span>.</p></LI><LI><p class="docList">From the truth of <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> OR <span class="docEmphasis">q</span> and the truth of NOT <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>, we can infer the truth of <span class="docEmphasis">q</span>.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">But <span class="docEmphasis">q</span> was arbitrary! It follows that any proposition whatsoever (even obviously false ones like 1 = 0) can be shown to be true in an inconsistent system.</p>
