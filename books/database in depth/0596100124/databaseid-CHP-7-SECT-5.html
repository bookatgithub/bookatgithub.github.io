<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-7-FIG-7">Figure 7-7</a> shows sample values for a possible but clearly bad design for suppliers: relvar SA is suppliers in Paris, and relvar SB is suppliers who either aren't in Paris or have status 30. As you can see, the design leads to redundancy—to be specific, the tuple for supplier S3 appears in both relvars—and as usual such redundancies give rise to update anomalies. (Redundancy of any kind always has the potential to cause update anomalies.)</P>

<p class="docText">By the way, note that the tuple for supplier S3 <span class="docEmphasis">must</span> appear in both relvars. For suppose it appeared in SB but not SA, say. From SA, then, the Closed World Assumption would allow us to infer that it's not the case that supplier S3 is in Paris. But SB tells us that supplier S3 <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> in Paris. Thus, we would have a contradiction on our hands, and the database would be inconsistent.</P>
<p class="docText">Well, the problem with the design of <a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-7-FIG-7">Figure 7-7</a> is obvious: it's precisely the fact that the very same tuple can appear in two distinct relvars—meaning, more precisely, that it's possible for that tuple to appear in both relvars without violating any constraint for either. So an obvious rule is:</p>
<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">The Principle of Orthogonal Design (first version):</span> No two distinct relvars in the same database should be such that their relvar constraints permit the same tuple to appear in both.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">The term <span class="docEmphasis">orthogonal</span> here derives from the fact that what the principle effectively says is that relvars should all be independent of one another—which they won't be, if their constraints "overlap," as it were.</p>
<p class="docText">Now, it should be clear that two relvars can't possibly violate the foregoing principle if they're of different types, and so you might be thinking the principle isn't worth much. After all, it isn't very usual for a database to contain two or more relvars of the same type. But consider <a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-7-FIG-8">Figure 7-8</a>, which shows another possible but clearly bad design for suppliers. While there's no way in that design for the same tuple to appear in both relvars, it <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> possible for a tuple in SX and a tuple in SY to have the same projection on {SNO,SNAME}<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-7-FNOTE-5">[*]</a></sup>—and that fact leads to redundancy and update anomalies again. So we need to extend the design principle accordingly:</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-7-FNOTE-5">[*]</a></sup> Projection is a relational operator, of course, but it clearly makes sense to define a version of the operator that works for tuples instead of relations and thereby to talk of a projection of some tuple. A similar remark applies to several other relational operators, too.</P></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">The Principle of Orthogonal Design (second and final version):</span> Let <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> be distinct relvars in the same database. Then there must not exist nonloss decompositions of <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> into (say) <span class="docEmphasis">A1, A2</span>, . . . <span class="docEmphasis">, Am</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B1, B2</span>, . . . <span class="docEmphasis">, Bn</span>, respectively, such that the relvar constraints for some projection <span class="docEmphasis">Ai</span> in the set <span class="docEmphasis">A1, A2</span>, . . . <span class="docEmphasis">, Am</span> and some projection <span class="docEmphasis">Bj</span> in the set <span class="docEmphasis">B1, B2</span>, . . . <span class="docEmphasis">, Bn</span> permit the same tuple to appear in both.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">The term <span class="docEmphasis">nonloss decomposition</span> here refers to nonloss decomposition in the usual normalization sense.</P>

<p class="docText">Several points arise from the foregoing discussion and definition:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">The second version of the principle subsumes the previous version, because one "nonloss decomposition" that's always available for any relvar <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> is the one that consists of just the identity projection (the projection of <span class="docEmphasis">R</span> on all of its attributes).</p></li><li><p class="docList">Like the principles of normalization, <span class="docEmphasis">The Principle of Orthogonal Design</span> is basically just common sense—but (again like normalization) it's <span class="docEmphasis">formalized</span> common sense.</p></li><li><p class="docList">The goal of orthogonal design is to reduce redundancy and thereby to avoid update anomalies (again like normalization). In fact, orthogonality complements normalization, in the sense that—loosely speaking—normalization reduces redundancy <span class="docEmphasis">within</span> relvars, while orthogonality reduces redundancy <span class="docEmphasis">across</span> relvars.</p></li><li><p class="docList">In fact, orthogonality complements normalization in another way, too. Again consider the decomposition of relvar S into its projections SX and SY, as illustrated in <a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-7-FIG-8">Figure 7-8</a>. I now observe that that decomposition satisfies <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> of the usual normalization principles! Both projections are in 5NF; the decomposition is nonloss; dependencies are preserved; and both projections are needed to reconstruct the original relvar S.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#databaseid-CHP-7-FNOTE-6">[*]</a></sup> It's orthogonality, not normalization, that tells us the decomposition is bad.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="databaseid-CHP-7-FNOTE-6">[*]</a></sup> I said earlier that a decomposition is nonloss if, when we join the projections back together, we get back to the original relvar. That's true, but it's not quite enough; in practice, we surely want to impose the extra requirement that every projection is needed in that join. For example, we probably wouldn't consider the decomposition of relvar S into its projections on {SNO}, {SNO,STATUS}, and {SNO,SNAME,CITY} as a sensible design—yet S is certainly equal to the join of those three projections.</p></blockquote></LI><li><p class="docList">Orthogonality might be common sense, but it's often flouted in practice.
