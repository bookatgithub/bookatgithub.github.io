<p class="docText">I need to take care of several further preliminaries. As I've already said, I'll be using some of the same examples here as in other books and articles of mine; in particular, the running example is the famous (or infamous) suppliers-and-parts database. I apologize for dragging this old warhorse out yet one more time, but the remark I made earlier about examples having been very carefully designed to illustrate exactly the points I want to make applies to this particular example in spades.</p>
<p class="docText">Second, my own understanding of the relational model has evolved over the years, and continues to do so. This book represents my very latest thinking on the subject; thus, if you detect any discrepancies between this book and the ones already mentioned (and there are a few), the treatment in this book should be taken as superseding that in those earlier ones. Though I hasten to add that such discrepancies are mostly of a fairly minor nature; what's more, I've taken care always to relate new terms and concepts to earlier ones, whenever I felt it was necessary to do so.</P>
<p class="docText">Third, I am, of course, going to talk about theory—but it's an article of faith with me that <span class="docEmphasis">theory is practical</span>. I mention this point explicitly because so many people seem to believe the exact opposite: namely, that if something's theoretical, it can't be practical. But the truth is that theory—at least, the theory I'm talking about here, which is relational theory, of course—is most definitely very practical indeed. The purpose of that theory is <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> just theory for its own sake; the purpose of that theory is to allow us to build systems that are 100 percent practical. Every detail of the theory is there for solid practical reasons. Indeed, much of that theory is not only practical, it's fundamental, straightforward, simple, useful, and it can be <span class="docEmphasis">fun</span> (as I hope to demonstrate in the course of this book).</p>
<p class="docText">(In fact, we really don't have to look any further than the relational model itself to find the most striking possible illustration of the foregoing thesis. Indeed, it really shouldn't be necessary to defend the notion that theory is practical, in a context such as ours: namely, a multibillion dollar industry totally founded on one great theoretical idea. But I suppose the cynic's position would be "Yes, but what has theory done for me lately?" In other words, those of us who do think theory is important must continually justify ourselves to our critics—which is another reason why I think a book like this one is needed.)</p>
<p class="docText">And another point: the standard "relational" language is SQL<a name="IDX-CHP-0-0072"></a>, of course, and I assume you're reasonably familiar with that language, as well as with basic database concepts in general. As you'll soon see, however, I'm pretty critical of SQL in what follows. The sad fact is that SQL fails in all too many ways to support the relational model properly; it suffers from numerous sins of both omission and commission (which is why I said it was "relational," in quotation marks, when I first mentioned it). But this state of affairs is precisely one of the reasons why you need to know the relational model! Because SQL's support for the model is so deficient, it gives you rope to hang yourself; so you need to know the theory in order <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> to hang yourself—that is, you need to know the theory in order to enforce for yourself the various disciplines that SQL really ought to enforce on your behalf but doesn't. A good example is duplicate rows: SQL allows duplicate rows, but the relational model doesn't. So you need to know<span class="docEmphasis">why</span> the model doesn't allow them in order to understand why it's important not to "take advantage" of this particular SQL "feature." As one reviewer of my original proposal for this book, Stephane Faroult, wrote: "When you have a bit of practice, you realize there's no way to avoid having to know the theory."</p>
<p class="docText">Talking of SQL, by the way, please note that I use the term <span class="docEmphasis">SQL</span> throughout the book to mean the standard version of that language exclusively, not some product-specific dialect (barring explicit statements to the contrary, of course). In particular, I follow the standard in pronouncing the name "ess cue ell," not "sequel" (though this latter pronunciation is common in the field), and therefore say things like <span class="docEmphasis">an</span> SQL table, not <span class="docEmphasis">a</span> SQL table.</p>
