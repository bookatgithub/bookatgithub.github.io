<p class="docText">This section discusses a number of miscellaneous issues regarding quantification.</p>
<a name="databaseid-appa-SECT-5.1"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">We Don't Need Both Quantifiers</h4>
<p class="docText">You might already know that we don't actually need both EXISTS and FORALL. The reason is that any statement that can be expressed in terms of EXISTS can always be expressed in terms of FORALL instead and vice versa. By way of example, consider again the predicate:</P>
<pre>
    EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> is taller than Steve )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">("Somebody is taller than Steve"). Another way to say the same thing is:</P>
<pre>
    NOT ( FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( NOT ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> is taller than Steve ) ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">("It is not the case that nobody is taller than Steve"). More generally, in fact, the statement:</P>
<pre>
    EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ) )
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">is logically equivalent to the following statement:</P>
<pre>
    NOT ( FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( NOT ( <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ) ) )
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">(where the predicate <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> might legitimately involve other parameters in addition to <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>). Likewise, the statement:</p>
<pre>
    FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">is logically equivalent to the statement:</p>
<pre>
    NOT ( EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( NOT ( <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ) ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">(where, again, the predicate <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> might legitimately involve other parameters in addition to <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>).</p>
<p class="docText">It follows from the foregoing that a formal language need not explicitly support both EXISTS and FORALL. But it's very desirable to support both in practice. The reason is that some problems are "more naturally" formulated in terms of EXISTS and others are "more naturally" formulated in terms of FORALL. For example, SQL supports EXISTS but not FORALL; as a consequence, certain queries are quite awkward to formulate in SQL. For example, consider the query "Get suppliers who supply all parts," which can be expressed in logic quite simply as follows:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> WHERE FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">s.</span>SNO = <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span>.SNO AND <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span>.PNO = <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>.PNO )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">("Get suppliers <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> such that, for all parts <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>, there exists a shipment <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span> linking that supplier <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> to that part <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>"; the variables <span class="docEmphasis">s, p</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span> are to be understood as ranging over the current values of relvars S, P, and SP, respectively). In SQL, by contrast, the query looks something like this:</p>
<pre>
    SELECT <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>.*
    FROM   S AS <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>
    WHERE  NOT EXISTS
         ( SELECT <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>.*
           FROM   P AS <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>
           WHERE  NOT EXISTS
                ( SELECT <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span>.*
                  FROM   SP AS <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span>
                  WHERE  <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>.SNO = <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span>.SNO
                  AND    <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span>.PNO = <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>.PNO ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">("Get suppliers <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> such that there does not exist a part <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> such that there does not exist a shipment <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span> linking that supplier <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> to that part <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>"). Well, <span class="docEmphasis">single</span> negation is bad enough (many users have difficulty with it); <span class="docEmphasis">double</span> negation, as in this SQL query, is much worse!</p>

<a name="databaseid-appa-SECT-5.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Empty Ranges</h4>
<a name="IDX-CHP-appa-0034"></a>
<p class="docText">Consider again the fact that the statements:</p>
<pre>
    EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">and:</P>
<pre>
NOT ( FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( NOT ( <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ) ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">are logically equivalent. As I've indicated several times already, the bound variable <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> in each of these statements must "range over" some set of permissible values. Suppose now that the set in question is empty (it might, for example, be the set of people over 50 feet tall). Then:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">The quantifier EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> clearly evaluates to FALSE (because no such <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> exists).</P></LI><li><p class="docList">The statement EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> (<span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>))—"There exists an <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> that makes <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>) evaluate to TRUE"—thus evaluates to FALSE as well, <span class="docEmphasis">regardless of what p(x) happens to be</span>. For example, the statement "There exists a person over 50 feet tall who works for IBM" evaluates to FALSE (unsurprisingly).</P></LI><LI><p class="docList">It follows that the negation NOT EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> (<span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>)), which is equivalent to the statement FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> (NOT (<span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>)), evaluates to TRUE—again, regardless of what <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>) happens to be. For example, the statement "All persons over 50 feet tall don't work for IBM"—or, more idiomatically, "No person over 50 feet tall works for IBM"—evaluates to TRUE (again unsurprisingly).</p></LI><LI><p class="docList">But if the predicate <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>) is arbitrary, then so is the predicate NOT (<span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>)). And therefore we have the following possibly surprising result: the statement FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( . . . ) evaluates to TRUE if there are no <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>'s, <span class="docEmphasis">regardless of what appears inside the parentheses</span>. For example, the statement "All persons over 50 feet tall do work for IBM" also evaluates to TRUE(!)—because, to say it again, there aren't any persons over 50 feet tall.</P></LI></UL>
<p class="docText">One implication of this state of affairs is that certain queries produce a result that you might not expect (if you don't know logic, that is). For example, the following query:</P>
<pre>
    <span class="docEmphasis">s</span> WHERE FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>
          ( IF <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>.COLOR = 'Purple'
            THEN EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">s</span>.SNO = <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span>.SNO AND <span class="docEmphasis">sp</span>.PNO = <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>.PNO ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">("Get suppliers who supply all purple parts") will return all suppliers if there aren't any purple parts. <span class="docEmphasis">Exercise</span>: Show an SQL formulation of this query.</p>

<a name="databaseid-appa-SECT-5.3"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">Defining EXISTS and FORALL</H4>
<p class="docText">You might have already realized that EXISTS and FORALL can be defined as an <span class="docEmphasis">iterated OR</span><a name="IDX-CHP-appa-0035"></a> and an <span class="docEmphasis">iterated AND</span><a name="IDX-CHP-appa-0036"></a>, respectively. I'll consider EXISTS first. Let <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>) be a predicate with a parameter <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> and let <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> range over the set <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> = {<span class="docEmphasis">x1, x2</span>, . . . <span class="docEmphasis">, xn</span>}. Then:</p>
<pre>
    EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">is a predicate, and it's defined to be equivalent to (and hence shorthand for) the predicate:</p>
<pre>
    FALSE OR <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x1</span> ) OR <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x2</span> ) OR ... OR <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">xn</span> )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">Observe in particular that this expression evaluates to FALSE if <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> is empty (as we already know). By way of example, let <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>) be "<span class="docEmphasis">x</span> has a moon" and let <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> be the set {Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars}. Then the predicate EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> (<span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>)) becomes "EXISTS <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> (<span class="docEmphasis">x</span> has a moon)," and it's shorthand for:</P>
<pre>
    FALSE OR ( Mercury has a moon ) OR ( Venus has a moon )
          OR ( Earth has a moon )   OR ( Mars has a moon )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">which evaluates to TRUE because (for example) "Mars has a moon" is true. Similarly:</P>
<pre>
    FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ) )
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">is a predicate, and it's defined to be equivalent to (and hence shorthand for) the predicate:</P>
<pre>
    TRUE AND <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x1</span> ) AND <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x2</span> ) AND ... AND <span class="docEmphasis">p</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">xn</span> )
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">And this expression evaluates to TRUE if <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> is empty (again, as we already know). By way of example, let <span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>) and <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> be as in the EXISTS example above. Then the predicate FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> (<span class="docEmphasis">p</span>(<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>)) becomes "FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> (<span class="docEmphasis">x</span> has a moon)," and it's shorthand for:</P>
<pre>
    TRUE AND ( Mercury has a moon ) AND ( Venus has a moon )
         AND ( Earth has a moon )   AND ( Mars has a moon )
</pre><BR>

<p class="docText">which evaluates to FALSE because (for example) "Venus has a moon" is false.</p>
<p class="docText">As an aside, let me remark that—as the examples clearly demonstrate—defining EXISTS and FORALL as iterated OR and AND, respectively, means that every predicate that involves quantification is equivalent to one that doesn't. Thus, you might be wondering, not without some justification, just what this business of quantification is really all about. Why all the fuss? The answer is as follows: we can define EXISTS and FORALL as iterated OR and AND <span class="docEmphasis">only because the sets we have to deal with are—thankfully—always finite</span> (because we're operating in the realm of computers, and computers in turn are finite, of course). In pure predicate logic, where there's no such restriction, those definitions aren't valid.</p>
<p class="docText">Perhaps I should add that, even though we're always dealing with finite sets and EXISTS and FORALL are thus merely shorthand, they're extremely <span class="docEmphasis">useful</span> shorthand! For my part, I certainly wouldn't want to have to formulate queries and the like purely in terms of AND and OR, without being able to use the quantifiers.</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Other Kinds of Quantifiers</h4>
<a name="IDX-CHP-appa-0037"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-appa-0038"></a>
<p class="docText">While it's true that EXISTS and FORALL are the most important quantifiers in practice, they aren't the only ones possible. There's no <span class="docEmphasis">a priori</span> reason, for example, why we shouldn't allow quantifiers of the form:</p>
<pre>
    there exist at least three <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>'s such that
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">or:</p>
<pre>
    a majority of <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>'s are such that
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">or:</p>
<pre>
    an odd number of <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>'s are such that
</pre><br>

<p class="docText">(and so on). One fairly important special case is <span class="docEmphasis">there exists exactly one x such that</span>. I'll use the keyword UNIQUE for this one. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre>
    UNIQUE <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> is taller than Arnold )
</pre><br>

<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Meaning:</span> Exactly one person is taller than Arnold; probably FALSE.</p></blockquote>
<pre>
    UNIQUE <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> has social security number <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> )
</pre><BR>

<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Meaning:</span> Exactly one person has social security number <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> (<span class="docEmphasis">y</span> is a parameter, of course). We can't assign a truth value to this example, because it's a predicate, not a proposition.</p></blockquote>
<pre>
    FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> UNIQUE <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> has social security number <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> )
</pre><br>

<blockquote><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Meaning:</span> Everybody has a unique social security number. (I'm assuming here that <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> ranges over the set of all social security numbers actually assigned, not all possible ones. Incidentally, does this predicate—which is in fact a proposition, of course—evaluate to TRUE?)</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">As another exercise, what does the following predicate mean?</p>
<pre>
    FORALL <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> UNIQUE <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> ( <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> has social security number <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> )
